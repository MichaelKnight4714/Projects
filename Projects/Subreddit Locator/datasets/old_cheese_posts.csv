"Cheese and dreams So a lot of you probably know about the experiment they did a couple years ago on specific cheese types giving you certain dreams. They tested with a few cheeses: stilton, cheddar, Cheshire, red Leicester, Lancashire.

Anybody else found a particular trend with other cheeses not listed here? Lately I've been eating gouda for the past 2 days and I not only had dreams (cause I usually don't) but they were unusually vivid. If you could note the type of dream (happy, nightmare, exciting, etc.) associated with the cheese, that would be cool. Thanks!",1

"Your opinion on letting cheese expire In another thread, u/kagemichaels mentions [that he lets Limburger expire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/bzl26p/if_you_could_only_eat_3_types_of_cheese_for_the/eqwlnrr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and that resonated with me since I tend to do the same thing with Limburger and other sort or semi-soft cheeses like Camembert or √âpoisses. The result is almost always amazing, the cheeses usually gain a ton of flavor, intensity and develop a sharpness the would never have had at their expiration date. 

Unfortunately, the result sometimes looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/nuv1bQ8.jpg) or even far worse, with a sunken rind or covered with tiny white freckles. Also some of these cheeses smell so strong that my wife demands that I repeatedly check if they are still edible.

Just to make that clear: I can tell an edible cheese from a spoiled one and make sure to always stay on the safe side. 

So what is this sub's on letting cheese expire? What if it has been out of the fridge for an elongated period of time or has been out on a cheese board far to long?",1

"[unpopular opinion?] Baguette and fresh bread &gt; crackers Lately i've been observing all these ""charcuterie boards"" and im kind of confused as to why every single one of you puts crackers on the side instead of freshly baked goods. Is this just some trend in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing better than a crisp baguette with a soft core to accompany my cheese.

Crackers are too salty and don't offer the complexity in taste and structure I deem ""delicious"".

Whole grain crackers aside, they're unhealty.

&amp;#x200B;

Change my mind.

Btw.: It's so damn easy to bake your own baguette. You even get to choose your prefered state of ""burned"" and the melting butter on top is something that let's me moan every time. Fuck crackers. :)",1

"Camembert - is it supposed to taste like that? I realize this is a lost cause as it's impossible to describe a taste properly, but: I bought some camembert two days ago because I always believe I'll love fancy cheeses and I'm always disappointed.   
But how is camembert supposed to taste? I've heard it tastes nutty and fruity. But all I tasted was this weird fermented taste, like something rotten, like fruit that has gone bad or orange juice that has gone off with a hint of ""regular"" cheese as an after-taste. I always imagined brie or camembert tasting like ""regular"" yellow cheese but more intense with strong overtones of spices...   
So, is that what camembert tastes like and what kind of cheese should I try if I wanna try a cheese that is more like cheese but stronger and more intense flavour?

https://www.snowdoniacheese.co.uk/cheese/black-bomber/

and i gotta say served by itself its unbelievable tasty, with a very unique taste with lots of little crunchy bits.

But one of my favourite snacks is to cook a paratha or a roti that i usually get frozen from my grocery store on a low heat until it starts bubbling and cut some pieces of cheese on it while its cooking and flip it over and kinda eat it like a makeshift grilled cheese.

my god i can not explain this fucking heavenly flavour.  this is hands down the most unique tasting thing ive ever tasted when its melted.  It's flavour profile completely changes and honestly this thing was worth every penny (8 CAD for 200grams).

That's all I want to say.",1

"Did they change Tillamook cheddar? Sorry if this is a weird post for this sub, didn't know where better to put it.

I've been getting Tillamook medium cheddar (pre-sliced) at Costco for something like 3-5ish years and it's been my favorite for something that's tasty, easy and not too pricey.

The last package I got though, the packaging was different. I figured it wouldn't really matter, right? I just made a couple quesadillas with it, though, and it's no longer the delicious gooeyness it has been. It smelled unusually strongly when I opened the package, the slices crumbled really easily, and after cooking the taste is kinda weird and the texture is just completely wrong, it's all curdley.

Did I just get a dud package or did they change their recipe or something? I recently tried Tillamook ice cream for the first time and had no complaints with that, so I didn't think they did anything weird, but this is the first time since long ago when I tried another brand's American that I put some cheese into my mouth and actually thought ""gross""

If it helps, I had just by happenstance not bought any more cheese for a while recently. I think the last time I got a package before this one was probably somewhere 3-6 months ago?",1

"How long can you keep a cut wheel of cheese? My fiance (originally from Switzerland) and I (British) love cheese and are thinking about getting a cheese wedding cake. The bottom 'tier' would be a 5-7kg full wheel of Swiss cheese, so similar in texture to Gruyere or Appenzeller but obviously much smaller than a Gruyere! (Marechal is our favourite but we're considering a few options.) Next tier up is likely to be Stilton or Stichelton.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the expected number of guests at our wedding and the expected total weight of the cheese wheels we will be ordering, there would probably be 2-3kg leftover from the wheel of Swiss cheese, and maybe 1kg leftover Stilton. If we take all the leftover cheese home with us, how long will the two different cheeses last in the fridge if wrapped in cheese paper?",1

I took that first bite and it literally tasted like semen. Cold, goopy, semen. I didn't know I had to let it sit for 30 minutes and get room temperature. Today after work I let it sit and adjust.

I love cheese, and have gotten my boyfriend to try a lot of new types.

He's had brie, and liked it, but he wished that it had a saltier taste. He hasn't had goat cheese, so I couldn't tell you his exact opinion on that.

I've tried to see if there is anything like a soft sharp cheddar, but they all seem to be cheese dips or spreads, rather than actual soft cheese. Maybe I'm just not that good at looking, so I'm sorry if this is something really obvious.

"Best One-Two Combos for Grilled Cheese? Could've asked at r/grilledcheese, I guess, but figured I'd consult the cheese experts first. 

Have been dealing with high blood sugar issues for a year now and have hence laid off bread during that time, which has been tough. Recently found a brand of bread at my local Meijer that's super-low carb and thus Grilled Cheeses are now an option in my life again!

Back when I was eating them more often, my go-to combination was Swiss + Cheddar. A relatively simple combo, but a tasty one: nice, smooth nuttiness from the Swiss and a cheesy sharpness from the Cheddar.

Now I'm looking to experiment more: Any flavor combinations of two cheeses that you've stumbled upon that might make a killer grilled cheese?",1
"Help! I have a cheese addictipn that‚Äôs destroying my body! Okay, so my entire life I‚Äôve been enjoying all forms of dairy. Like I‚Äôd drink 2 gallons of milk a week, eat cheese plain, all that.

Giving up milk was easy (since that affects me the worst), I replaced it with lactaid milk which I have no problem with. Butter was fairly easy too since there are vegetable based butters. BUT THERES NOTHING THAT CAN FILL THE VOID OF CHEESE!

SO my question, is there any lactose free cheeses? Anything similar enough to get me by? Idk if I‚Äôm even posting in the right subreddit but I‚Äôm honestly desperate. I feel so sick and tired every day because I‚Äôm also a night eater, and my go-to is cheese.",1

"Morbier: To rind, or not to rind? I had some (delicious) Morbier the other day from a restaurant on a cheese plate. It was already sliced up into small pieces, and the rind was still intact on either end of the piece. In fact, the rind was quite delicious: Lightly crunchy from the crystallization with a bit of funk and salt. Really complemented the meat of the cheese well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I bought a big slice of Morbier from the cheese shop the other day and I noticed something different. The rind near the ""back"" edge of the cheese (that is, where the outer edge of the wheel would be, basically) was extremely hard. Like hard enough that I'd just assume it was not edible.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, as you move towards the tip of the slice (what would be the center of a wheel), the rind gets noticeably softer. There's basically a gradient along the slice where it goes from incredibly hard to reasonably soft. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question: Do you just eat the rind up to the point where it becomes unpleasantly hard for your personal taste? That would be my assumption, I guess, but I wanted to get other people's opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question: I always thought Morbier was a washed rind cheese. But if that's the case, how could the rind of this slice I bought be so hard at the back? Has my assumption that all washed rind cheeses have \*soft\* rinds been wrong all along? Can washed rinds be hard??",1

While the texture is really nice, its def different than cheaper fetas ive bought. Is this normal for sheep milk cheese?

"Colby?? I came here after finding a short thread about someone looking for Colby a few years ago.  I'm currently trying to find it myself.  What's going on with it?  Is there suddenly some prejudice against it or is it not being made anymore?  For at least 40 years in Colorado I've been able to get it easily in the deli and the cheese section (slices, sticks, blocks, organic, non organic), and I did every time I went to the store.  It's been a favorite snack cheese all my life.  Suddenly, about a month ago, every store in my area (King Soopers, Safeway, Albertsons and Walmart) stopped carrying it.  All forms and brands gone.  Poof.  The only way it exists anymore is mixed up with the overpowering flavor of jack which I can't stand.  I saw, in that old thread, people saying that Colby is sharp, but it's about as mild as you can get and still have flavor.  I saw other people saying it's just like mild cheddar, but it's not.  It's not nearly as fatty or greasy as cheddar and it's more delicate in flavor.  This is what makes it a wonderful snacking cheese.  King Soopers even has a special cheese section that has cheeses from all over the world (many so specialized you've never heard of them) and super expensive ($5 or more for a bite sized square).  What happened to good Wisconsin Colby?  How can we get stores to carry it again?",1

It's made from Sheep's milk, and it says on the website it's ""Made in the traditional Dutch Gouda style,"" but this tastes nothing like any Gouda I've had before, so I'm hesitant to tell people it's ""Gouda"" because this is very different.

"Cheese vehicles besides crackers &amp; bread? I love cheese. And cheese on crackers, bread, biscuits, etc., has been one of my go-to snacks for years.

Of course cheese is delicious on its own. Of course it is. And I often will slice off a chunk of cheese and eat it solo.

"Flamb√© + Wheel ‚Äî Advice needed Anyone ever had the Bucatini all'Amatriciana flamb√® at Trattoria Vecchia Roma in Rome? This place and dish needs to be on the bucket list of any cheese fanatic.  It‚Äôs bucatini pasta in a red sauce with guanciale that is tossed into a wheel of pecorino that has been doused in alcohol and set afire.  The melted cheese gets mixed in with the pasta, and it‚Äôs quite possibly the greatest meal in the world.  My buddy, who is a fantastic amateur cook, keeps talking about flying back to Rome just to eat at that restaurant.  

Here‚Äôs where I need your help. He has basically reverse-engineered the dish that it tastes very, very close to what we hadn‚Äôt in Rome.  He wants to take it a step further and get the wheel of pecorino.  Costco sells a 50-pound wheel for $330.  It‚Äôs not the best pecorino, but it‚Äôs good enough.   I think what he‚Äôs looking to do is to host dinner parties for friends.  The flamb√© is something that is rarely if ever seen in the US, so it would be quite unique.  Get a few friends to chip in, and you‚Äôve got a bunch of dinners in 2019.   

Let‚Äôs set aside how bad of an idea this could be.  It‚Äôs only $330, so that‚Äôs not going to bankrupt anyone.  Cheese will assuredly get wasted, but chunks can be given away to attendees.  Where I need your expertise is what steps you would take to ensure this could reasonably work.  

Here are my thoughts as to what we need:

1) Hired help to start the wheel.  I think we need to pay the guy at the local cheese shop to chizzle out the top of this thing to start it so it‚Äôs able to be a bowl for pasta to be dumped into.  

2) Freezer/vacuum bag for the wheel.  After each meal, put it in the vacuum bag and freeze it.  Pull it out a day or two in advance of the next meal. Repeat as needed. 

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve come up with.  Any constructive guidance, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  I‚Äôve noticed experts and aficionados on this sub, and your tips could go a long way to making sure this concept isn‚Äôt a complete disaster.

"One of my favorite Italian cheeses: Gorgonzola! Gorgonzola is a blue [Italian cheese](https://www.gianlucatognon.com/indulging-in-italian-cheese/) produced from pasteurized whole cow‚Äôs milk with the addition of enzymes and selected moulds. It was first made in the town of Gorgonzola, in the north of Italy, at the end of the 10th century.

There are two types of Gorgonzola, sweet and savory. I like the first which is a mix of creamy and more solid parts. According to the legend, this mix of two parts of different consistency came from the fact that a young dairyman, lingering with his girlfriend, failed to complete the work of the day, postponing it to the following day. By mixing the curd of the evening with the one of the morning, he inadvertently managed to create a cheese which had never been produced before.

"Attempting to find ""American Style"" cheddar in Europe BIG DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT MEAN THE PROCESSED CHEESE PRODUCT. American style is in quotes because I don't know the correct term

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm an American that has moved to Europe. The cheese scene is excellent but I have been craving a nice sharp cheddar. Problem is the British Style sharp cheddars don't seem to match what I expect from a sharp cheddar. The cheddar I'm looking for could be described as sour, but I've been stopping at several cheesemongers where I live and the best they can do with that description is ""well we have some really fresh goat cheese"" (delicious but not cheddar). Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Am I missing some critical term or searching in the wrong places?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills since the information I can find online doesn't seem to mention this difference at all. I'd almost suspect I'm talking about the fake cheese except for that I remember clearly loving a cheddar I got from a local cheese maker in the US with that exact sour flavor. I hope my cheddar memories aren't a lie

Is it really because they do not use the cow species fed by grass only from a certain area of Italy?  I have a doubt, because the taste is just about the same to my palate.

Does this parmesan have the same wheel breaking process as real Parmigiano-Reggiano?  Looking at its texture, I doubt it.

"What is this cheese?! Please help! üßÄüò¢ The context is that I told the people in charge of a charcuterie board situation at work to get cheese from two different places - 1. A supermarket in Toronto 2. A local deli/cheese/butcher shop, so this cheese could be from either place. On the night of said party, people were all leaving and we decided to just cut chunks of cheese from the boards and take them home as they'd just sit around over the weekend. I took a chunk of manchego and then spotted this guy and took a chunk off too.

The clues:

1. I know it said Castello and 'mild' on the rind of the wedge. Bear in mind, it was a wedge and not a block. It also was not a Castello mild blue cheese, trust me, I looked.
2. It had a light blue Castello motif but the chunk I cut off has neither of these marks. Was I imagining all of this? Let's hope not.
3. The cheese itself is white, but around the interior layer of the rind, it yellows a bit.
4. Very strong savoury taste, almost like cheddar but I don't think it's that..
5. Texture wise - it's not soft like a brie, a blue, a gorgonzola or a mature cheese like a parmesan. It's a little creamier than an aged cheddar I'd say, and has more white than yellow colour wise. Perhaps a goat's cheese? It reminds me a little of a less mature version of an Ontarian bandaged goat's cheese cheddar I've had before.
6. White wax rind, but with another layer below of ridged... rind..? I don't know what it is.
7. Last thing - Castello makes a ton of packaged blue cheeses. This was not packaged in that manner, it was definitely a wedge taken from a wheel and re-sold. The thing that's throwing me is that I can't find any other Castello cheeses with their logo printed on the actual outside of the wheel, sort of in the Louis Vuitton fashion.
8. I have googled 'white waxed Castello cheese' 'white mild Castello cheese' and 'Castello white wax blue logo cheese that's also white inside but has another layer and also tastes very nice' and can Google no more.
9. These sad photos of the cheese chunk may offer some more hints. I don't know.

Aaaaaagh.

Being more or less ignorant of the cheese market and politics outside of the US and Canada, this made me curious. Is there a reason for Kiwi cheese dominating the market in this little corner of the world, or is it just a coincidence? NZ seems like the least likely place from which to import cheese to the West Indies, and yet it seemed ubiquitous. ",1

"Camembert (supermarket) I bought some olive bread (which is salty) and a round of Camembert (which is mild) to have pre-dinner tonight. 

However, when I unwrap the Camembert wheel it 1) is spotted with small brown spots on the rind instead of a smooth whitish color, and 2) smells unusual, like a faint ammonia aroma. I cut about a third of the wheel off and it's runny and bright yellow so I figure it's good. But the taste is off, like a stale salty taste is the best I can describe it.

I just bought it today so I thought wow that's odd. Then I check the best buy date and it says 1/29/19. Would this still be considered ok to eat and serve to a dinner guest? What would you do?",1

"Need a name for a type of cheese Back where I'm from, you could get a kind of farmer's market kind of cheese that I love, but I would not have any idea how to ask for it, or look for it in the U.S.I assume it's not available for purchase in chain stores, since it's a fresh kind of cheese.

My best description of it is:

1.  It's a white cheese.
2.  It's tender, in between squishy and solid block cheese.
3. Creamy.
4. You buy it in blocks.
5. When you slice, your knife will have some of the creamy texture on it afterward.
6. Very slightly salty.
7. Nice slightly sour taste that stays in your mouth (the sourness is not as much as yogurt).
8. It does not have a strong smell.
9. It's not brittle (a given since it's fresh and creamy).
10. Not full of holes.
