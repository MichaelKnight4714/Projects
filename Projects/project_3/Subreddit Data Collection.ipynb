Is there suddenly some prejudice against it or is it not being made anymore?  For at least 40 years in Colorado I've been able to get it easily in the deli and the cheese section (slices, sticks, blocks, organic, non organic), and I did every time I went to the store.  It's been a favorite snack cheese all my life.  Suddenly, about a month ago, every store in my area (King Soopers, Safeway, Albertsons and Walmart) stopped carrying it.  All forms and brands gone.  Poof.  The only way it exists anymore is mixed up with the overpowering flavor of jack which I can't stand.  I saw, in that old thread, people saying that Colby is sharp, but it's about as mild as you can get and still have flavor.  I saw other people saying it's just like mild cheddar, but it's not.  It's not nearly as fatty or greasy as cheddar and it's more delicate in flavor.  This is what makes it a wonderful snacking cheese.  King Soopers even has a special cheese section that has cheeses from all over the world (many so specialized you've never heard of them) and super expensive ($5 or more for a bite sized square).

This place and dish needs to be on the bucket list of any cheese fanatic.  It’s bucatini pasta in a red sauce with guanciale that is tossed into a wheel of pecorino that has been doused in alcohol and set afire.  The melted cheese gets mixed in with the pasta, and it’s quite possibly the greatest meal in the world.  My buddy, who is a fantastic amateur cook, keeps talking about flying back to Rome just to eat at that restaurant.  \\n\\nHere’s where I need your help. He has basically reverse-engineered the dish that it tastes very, very close to what we hadn’t in Rome.  He wants to take it a step further and get the wheel of pecorino.  Costco sells a 50-pound wheel for $330.  It’s not the best pecorino, but it’s good enough.   I think what he’s looking to do is to host dinner parties for friends.  The flambé is something that is rarely if ever seen in the US, so it would be quite unique.  Get a few friends to chip in, and you’ve got a bunch of dinners in 2019.   \\n\\nLet’s set aside how bad of an idea this could be.  It’s only $330, so that’s not going to bankrupt anyone.  Cheese will assuredly get wasted, but chunks can be given away to attendees.  Where I need your expertise is what steps you would take to ensure this could reasonably work.  \\n\\nHere are my thoughts as to what we need:\\n\\n1) Hired help to start the wheel.  I think we need to pay the guy at the local cheese shop to chizzle out the top of this thing to start it so it’s able to be a bowl for pasta to be dumped into.  \\n\\n2) Freezer/vacuum bag for the wheel.  After each meal, put it in the vacuum bag and freeze it.  Pull it out a day or two in advance of the next meal. Repeat as needed. \\n\\nThat’s all I’ve come up with.  Any constructive guidance, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

A supermarket in Toronto 2. A local deli/cheese/butcher shop, so this cheese could be from either place. On the night of said party, people were all leaving and we decided to just cut chunks of cheese from the boards and take them home as they'd just sit around over the weekend. I took a chunk of manchego and then spotted this guy and took a chunk off too.\\n\\nThe clues:\\n\\n1. I know it said Castello and 'mild' on the rind of the wedge. Bear in mind, it was a wedge and not a block. It also was not a Castello mild blue cheese, trust me, I looked.\\n2. It had a light blue Castello motif but the chunk I cut off has neither of these marks. Was I imagining all of this? Let's hope not.\\n3. The cheese itself is white, but around the interior layer of the rind, it yellows a bit.\\n4. Very strong savoury taste, almost like cheddar but I don't think it's that..\\n5. Texture wise - it's not soft like a brie, a blue, a gorgonzola or a mature cheese like a parmesan. It's a little creamier than an aged cheddar I'd say, and has more white than yellow colour wise. Perhaps a goat's cheese? It reminds me a little of a less mature version of an Ontarian bandaged goat's cheese cheddar I've had before.\\n6. White wax rind, but with another layer below of ridged... rind..? I don't know what it is.\\n7. Last thing - Castello makes a ton of packaged blue cheeses. This was not packaged in that manner, it was definitely a wedge taken from a wheel and re-sold. The thing that's throwing me is that I can't find any other Castello cheeses with their logo printed on the actual outside of the wheel, sort of in the Louis Vuitton fashion.\\n8. I have googled 'white waxed Castello cheese' 'white mild Castello cheese' and 'Castello white wax blue logo cheese that's also white inside but has another layer and also tastes very nice' and can Google no more.\\n9.

It also might help my boyfriend with his closure.\\n\\nI'd probably like to make a special cheese board, with nuts, salami, dried fruits, and crackers that match the cheese, also maybe a good beer that goes well with gouda (my boyfriend does not like wine)\\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\",\n",
