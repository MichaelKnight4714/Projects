"How difficult was it to get your medical cannabis license in Florida? I'm setting up an appointment to get my medical marijuana license evaluation next month. I've had 2 severe anxiety disorders the majority of my life and medication wasn't something I wanted to go on. They are so severe they interfere with work and personal life. Weed has been the only thing that has helped. I've been in therapy before and it helped a little bit. For those of you in Florida, how difficult was the process for you?",0

"Job interview popped up out of no where, how do I pass fast? I just had a job opportunity come up that pays more then double what I'm making now. The catch is that the only day they're interviewing people is in a week and they're doing drug test on site. I smoke 1-2 joints a day, sometimes a bong hit on top of that. I know that weight also matters, I was 285 when I started smoking a year ago and I'm down to 235 and still dropping weight.

If I do nothing but drink water (I drink lots anyway, love it) this week and run for an hour everyday is there even a chance I could pass?? Or is my best bet to get a clean sample and some sort of device.

Any help/ideas would be amazing. I would be so upset to miss this chance over something I do at home",0

How to tell the difference between CBD strains and THC strains? Recently it was the first time I've gotten ripped off. The guy sold me CBD strains which can easily be bought from our local CBD dispensaries or online. I did feel a calming sensation but it wasn't the THC high I was looking for. Is there any way to tell the difference without smoking?,0

"I quit Vaping I quit Vaping and went back to smoking because no matter what form of Vaping i was doing it made me gag and cough. I even have a volcano so it isn't my device. Tried e juice, nope. Distillate, nope. And several crappy versions that are worse than smoking like Mct oil carts. Once got coconut oil when they claimed it was wax cartridge. 

Anything i try only tastes good for a second then I'm coughing a lung. And that burnt popcorn or beans taste is awful. Abv edibles taste terrible too.

I think it's unhealthy in comparison to smoking especially e juice and distillate, not enough research to say it's healthier especially with Vaping flavors and terpenes which in my experience terpenes burn easy and i mean bad burn. And Vaping dry herb feels like water vapor instead of actual cannabinoids

Smoking gets it all into you and Vaping gets you some then you have abv....it's a shame i wanted it to work. i actually use more herb Vaping then smoking and i get less high Vaping

Anyone else feel this way? 

I'm tired of coughing and getting barely high. I smoke a joint and I'm good for at least 2-3 hours but when i vape I'm like itching for relief within half an hour. By my math i can smoke .5 in five minutes and vape it in an hour. So clearly Vaping is not efficient.

I know I'm not doing it wrong because I've tried several devices and methods over five years. I'm finally done trying lol. Smoking tastes and feels better plus is faster.",0

"Concentrate inside or outside a joint? Which do you prefer? So I'm stoned and I'm contemplating dank joints and how they are made.

I was wondering what people think is the best method to roll a joint with concentrate (kief, wax, shatter, etc), inside the joint or outside, and why?

To answer my own question i feel like it's a waste to put concentrate on the outside because your smoking what's inside the joint not outside. I mean like I've rolled em that way and i never feel i get the full effect like when it's rolled inside. Sure it looks pretty outside and you can make art out of it but it's only gonna burn off and not really get in you. I'm sure some will but it's not efficient. Maybe it's better for sharing or hot boxing because it gets everywhere lol unlike when it's inside it kinda would go into one person in one fat rip and everyone else wouldn't get any. I've experienced this with friends.

So i like it inside (that's what she said!) Cuz i usually smoke alone and don't hot box anymore.

"Developing discipline/moderation? I’ve never had moderation with drugs or alcohol or anything else. Now that I’ve been sober for 3 years I’m starting to wonder if I can actually do things in moderation if I just try.

One thing I realized from coffee is that I’ll quit for months or even years and one day decide to go back and automatically start drinking it every day even multiple times.

Yesterday I drank a latte after 4 months off. I told myself I would have a latte once every two weeks from now on, and if I can do that for a year and it gets easier, then after a year I will try drinking alcohol or smoking weed once every 2-3 weeks.

I kind of wanted coffee again today but didn’t, and this is probably my first time going back to something and not having it again the next day so it’s already a big thing for me. I’m realizing that if I just set the goal I can actually do it.

My hope is that since I have 3 years off of weed and alcohol, I will be less dependent on it if I go back. Like I’ll be able to take it or leave it.

Do you think I can compare coffee to alcohol and weed, or will they be much more powerful in that I won’t be able to go the next day without it?",0

"weed made me hate my date and myself      i met up with this guy who ive been secretly talking to for the last few months for the second time yesterday. we both had our first kiss together the first time we met up. i really do think i loved him. and its crazy because i talk about it like it all happened years ago and it didnt. yesterday we met up again a second time and got high and all of a sudden i just started hating him for no reason. i didnt want him near me, i didnt want his arm around me or him close to my face. 
      i ended up feeling so bad that i ended our little date thing early because we just were sorta sitting in a little opening in a forest in complete silence. honestly it was a really scary high. i was paranoid and upset that i couldnt figure our why i was feeling so apathetic towards him, and then i started thinking about how i dont love anything, that i just might not be able to be chained down by a person or a relationship, and that i was meant to be free and a loner that would just live to have lots of experiences and stories to tell. 
     i understand that might not seem like a bad thing but it completely goes against everything i thought i wanted, and its like this dark cloud looming over me telling me i should just be alone. ive tried talking to him about just these complex and weird emotions ive been having the last two days and he just doesnt really seem to care about how i feel, albeit, hes also been insanely high himself. he usually gets like this while high.
    the thing is, this high was really weird for me though, not like what i usually feel and i havent quite experienced anything like it before so its just making it really hard to understand how much of it was something i should worry about and how much i should just shrug off and blame the weed on. 
     i just felt so disappointed in myself. like i kept getting these flashbacks to distant memories from my childhood i thought id forgotten and i would think about everything i thought i would be when i was my age now and what i thought i was going to be like as a child is nothing like how ive turned out. i feel like an embarrassment and that i ruin everybody.",0

"What to do if child accidently injests edibles? So Im a nanny and the mother (my boss) owns and runs her own hemp farm/CBD bussiness start up. We're both marijuana friendly but of course, the kids (11, 8, 4, 3) arent exposed to weed, edibles, smoking, etc. 


That being said, accidents happen. What should I do if one of the kids happen into their moms stash? Maybe they think a candy or edible or one of her bussiness products is just that, not realizing what is really in it. 


Ive tried Google, but everywhere says rush them to the ER and prepare for CPS and child services and the police, etc. A lot of the info is fear mongering anti-marijuana drivel telling parents to rifle through their teenagers rooms for candy.


I'm just looking for realistic expectations of what would happen so I could respond quickly and efficiently.",0

"Marijuana Possession charge... I do not know what to do. Hey guys, I was arrested yesterday in NJ for having less than 1 gram of bud. I am 25, still living with my parents after graduating college. I was sitting in my car after work and decided to roll one up in the parking lot (stupid mistake I know). The state police snuck up to my window and caught me in the process, so I did not have time to hide the evidence. I was then put in in handcuffs and taken to the station to get processed. I am due to appear in court in about 2 weeks. I was wondering if there's any way I can ask for conditional discharge without an attorney as I cannot afford one at the moment. This is my first offense and I have no criminal record. Should I plead not guilty and ask for a public defender? Should I just go by myself and stick it out? I have never been to court before so I do not know what to expect.

Also I remember just looking at my boyfriend and zoning out completely and tripping balls and then I came back to reality.

"Still feel weird 3 days after smoking Hey everyone! 
Decided to ask here before totally freaking out and going to the doctor. I smoked from a bong about 3 days ago and am still feeling numbness in my body and a general feeling of disconnection, floatiness and brain fog. I feel sort of ""out of it"" and not like myself. 

Some background info: I've only smoked a couple of times before. When I smoke after drinking I experience memory loss for the period after the weed kicks in. I also had a severe panic attack the first time I had edibles(there was way too much in them obviously) where I was tripping balls and thought I was dying(ended up calling 911). Now leading up to this moment, I've smoked like 3 times within a week. 2 of those times were a bad experience(though not as bad as the edibles experience) and I got close to having a full-blown panic attack when I smoked from the bong 3 days ago. 

My question is whether this is something I should see a doctor for or if I should wait longer for these symptoms to go away on their own?",0

"Worst high of my life so far. Iv been smoking some what regularly for a little over a year now . earlier today I smoked like I usually do, the usual amount. at first I was having fun I made myself a late breakfast and watched some youtube videos I was having a good time. At like the 45 min mark I was having a horrible time. my mind kept racing I couldn't concentrate on one thing. So as my mind kept thinking my thoughts really got out of control. I didn't feel like myself. I felt as if everything I had ever known even myself was complexity fabricated. Nothing seemed real in the slightest bit and I was having a hard time coming to terms with it.  That was the worst part of my experience this time I couldn't understand why life was real, or who I was, nothing in the world we lived in made sense. I thought maybe I was too high and watched a video and everything the lady said in the video made it worse. So its a little while later and I decide to go my room so I could sleep it off. I just wanted it to be over. But then I couldn't get comfortable what so ever. eventually I did after I freaked out some more. I turned on some music and fell asleep. when found some songs that didn't provoke my mind to think about any and everything.

Usually I'll be home alone and start sparking up and I'll be able to chill n do whatever I wanted, I would even go for a walk. 

In the past couple of weeks, however I've found I've been paranoid to the point I've believed that I've been followed by multiple people and that they're all connected and following me. 

I know this is obviously stupid and the logic in my brain tries to overrule it but it just doesn't happen. Even when I'm alone I'll sit and worry myself into a stupid hole.

I'll wait it out and an hour or so later the CBD kicks in and I'm all good, chillin n everything. I'm just wondering if anyone has an understanding of what I'm dealing with, whether it's my own problem that is amplified by smoking or whether I should cut weed out for a bit or even if when I'm smoking I should smoke more so that I'm hit with more CBD initially which will mellow me out to start? 

As you can see I'm quite unsure so any help would be appreciated, hopefully if anyone else is struggling with this and just wants to chill they'll be able to help themselves too!

"Can make thc stored in your body fat make you high? I'm not a native English speaker, so some sentences might not be completely correct. 
I was recently at some kind of festival and I had a couple beers and a bit of nicotine afterwards I was dancing for about 2h straight. After I went home I felt a bit high after  feeling sober for like 1h after the nicotine and alcohol. I once read that you can fail a thc test after doing sports even though you smoked weed months before because some thc might be stored in your body fats. I accidentally drank the part with the most butter from a thc tea so I probably hat thc from like 7g of weed therefore I got really fried and I ate a lot.
 My theory is, that I had a lot of thc in my fat and I lost it while dancing to get high afterwards. It might be placebo but it really felt like being high.",0

"Smoking weed ruined my life I live in a country in which weed isn’t legal so you have to get it from dealers without rly knowing what substances are actually  inside the pot you’re buying. I never bought weed but I used to smoke my friends’ and every time everything played out as I expected it to: I got high, it felt amazing and a few hours later I was back to being my usual  self. 

Well that I was until I smoked with these friends that I’m not very close with for the first time, it was this shitty-looking hash that I’m almost certain was laced with some crap cos I had a massive panic attack while on it, had an awful headache accompanied by nausea and terrible brain fog and the worst part was that I smoked it about three weeks ago and I feel like I never properly came down from that high. I’ve become retarded since then, I can’t make logical connections, I lose any train of thought I start and I find it hard to express myself verbally. The friends I chilled with are known as my school’s stoners and I thought they were all fried because of the huge amount of thc they put inside their bodies everyday but now I understand that the thc’s not the one to blame given that the weed they usually have is defs laced. 

I smoked it during my summer break before 12th grade, which hasnt ended yet, and I know for a fact that my grades will drop from As to Ds next year, I ruined my dreams of studying abroad and becoming a doctor. My life’s over, I’ve been feeling suicidal cos of this.",0

"i need somes advices guys please so, basically i'm a french-guy and i used to smoke weed with somes friends back in high-school

Now i'm grown-up, and most of my friends went-away

I got a job, i work everydays, it's a pretty physical one too

And i got pretty-shitty superiors who do nothing all-day long,

But still manage to throw shit at me for coming 10-minutes lates one-day in the span of 9 months

It's tiring, and my life as been stressful for some-times now

So i just want to blow some steam-off at the end of the week basically

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been thinking of smoking weed again

The thing is:

\-i absolutely hate tobacco

\-and my friends went-away and we stopped talking since years because we all had to do our lifes separated

&amp;#x200B;

I still take somes news from them, because i want to keep contact and know if they're having a good-life

It would be extremely awkward and insincere from me to just straight-up ask them to put me in contact with somes dealers near my location

&amp;#x200B;

So basically

I've been thinking about growing weed

It's illegal to smoke, or grow-it here, but it's not illegal to buy seeds

Don't ask-me why, it's stupid, that's all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty alright at gardening flowers, fruits, and vegetables

So i think it wouldn't be too hard for me

But i have no ideas what kind of seeds i should-buy, or how to make-it grow

When the plant will be grown-up, how do i ""extract""-it?

And how should i consume it, i don't really want to go back to smoke with cigs, i hate-it

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be alright to just buy the ""finished-product"" from someone

But since it's reddit, i guess most of you guys are not in France, which would make it impossible

And it would probably be illegal and i wouldn't want to put anyone in troubles for this",0

"Eye twitch ? Hi guys,

So i'm vaping concentrate (only 3 puffs at night before going to sleep) and I usually get the rose gold from Bloom farms. Now about a month ago my dispensary advised me to try Unwind from Ace extracts and after smoking it I developped a left eye twitch.

What I notice is if I don't smoke for like 2 days, the eye twitch goes away and if I smoke, sure enough the next morning it comes back.

Do you think it's something in the Ace extracts product that might trigger this or is it weed in general? I've been smoking weed for years and never had this before but maybe I'm getting older and that's what weed does to me now.

I'll definitely get back to rose gold after I finish to use the Unwind but was wondering if any of you had experience with this issue.

"My heart almost stopped after smoking weed. Recently around a month ago I was hospitalized for smoking weed, i smoked out of a vaporizer which I found out later had to do with it. This particular vape hit really hard and always had you high to the point where you’d be so lazy that you wish you could move but you couldn’t.
 After I’m done, maybe around 20 minutes, my heart starts beating so fast that my chest starts feeling hot to the touch and I start getting the symptoms of a heart attack, I am young and my heart has always been healthy and stable. My jaw started to feel weird and my whole left side went limp and it felt like my bicep was being pulled apart from end to end. It was so intense that I thought I could be having a Charlie horse. 
It had got so intense that I had to go to the hospital and I’m not like any of those people who gets so high that they go to the hospital because there scared, no there was actually something wrong.
But it was only till after the hospital visit I learned that my heart could of actually stopped. I have an app on my phone called heart rate free and it’s 100% accurate (I tested it at the hospital with the machine next to me) and before I even thought about going to the hospital it read 175 bmp which was very dangerous for me to have been laying down doing nothing. It had been going for hours and  I was scared I had a blood clot or something was wrong with my heart. But it was just doing its job because when I got to the hospital and they ran blood tests I found out the large amounts of thc in my system were making me dehydrated and thickening up my blood making my heart work way harder than it needed to. If I would’ve stayed at home I could’ve had a heart attack and died cause that was was slowly happening. My heart needed to beat faster to get more blood to my organs but I found out the faster it went the more blood and hydration it would need but since I was dried up it was basically doing everything it could to stay alive. The hospital realized this and quickly put fluids in me and re-hydrated me which is when my heart rate of 190 went down to 100 which is how they double checked from the blood tests that it was the problem because my heart stated to calm down after it. They told me to be careful and sent me home where it went down even more from that. 

What I’m saying is that nobody can die from weed but you can die from dehydration. And  It still scares me to this day knowing that I could’ve died from it. I haven’t smoked weed since and I’m not planning too because hours of constant beating at high Bpm’s can really affect your hearts health and I’m worried if it happens again I won’t be able to live to tell the story again. Be safe when smoking large amounts and especially if your hot boxing bring as much water as you can. Believe it or not it could save your life.

My intention was to put some hybrid / sativa based oil Double Delicious (Seattle supplier)  into my own cookies and such. I've recently moved to the UK and bought a vape pen and put some of the oil in the pen. However I think that the guy at the pot shop told me the wrong info because on the back of the packaging it says that there is coconut oil in this item and says for external use only. So I think the shit I bought is a topical oil.

- did I just fuck up my vape pen by putting a topical oil in it?

- are there negative health affects by vaping a topical oil?

"Coming out of a grow box. Hi fellow potheads.

I have been smoking for something close to 10 years now. I tried to quit but, even after almost 4 months of absolute abstinence I did not see any benefits. 

I mean the short term memory improved , but I was so tense and sleepless and pissed off that the total effect was negative.

Looks like i am one of those who need to smoke to function. 

Well I want to come out with it and stop hiding and just smoke whenever I want.

But the problem is that weed is considered illegal in my country. 

I mean I can make it legal just for me as a medicine, but still being a pothead is frown upon.

"The Boundy Buds So this is a story about some friends of mine, about a ""strain"" that we smoked for awhile that was wack. So a guy named Boundy grows weed, the weed is called boundy bud and from my short experience is full skitz, now I've done my fair share of psychedelics so weed now is still just a one way ticket to a trip, I was there for one of these events and heard about the other last night, first event was with a mate who we will call Tom asked me to pack him a phat cone and I did, he was already pretty stoned and we had a new massive party sized cone piece, so he punched the cone pulled it through was fine, maybe an hour passes and he asks for another this is where shit hits the fan a bit, I packed it to the rim was a bit bigger than the last one but i thought he would be fine but yeah nah, punches it pull it through looks like hes gonna green, i was thinking she'll be right, he was on the ground at this point and gets up stumbling around and blacks out falling smashing his head into a wood been a cutting his face up pretty bad then well having a seizure for no longer than 5 seconds, full fucked, he was alright after just really out of it but we took care of him and having his girlfriend there helping him out all night, he was fine  and still smokes weed.
So I asked him about it and he said it had happened before on the same strain maybe two weeks prior, got me thinking that it wasn't him hitting his head that caused it and more evidence has come to light, so this other mate we will call Ted had apparently been punching cones all night asked for one more and had blacked out and had a seizure as well for again no longer than 5 seconds.
Sharing this to get any more ideas on why it might have happened.",0

About to break a 5 day t-break. Aren’t you supposed to have crazy dreams? I’ve been a relatively heavy smoker for around two years now and this was my first ever tolerance break. It was actually not as difficult as I thought it would be. The only “symptom” I experienced were a slight high temper. I am disappointed though that I did not have any hyper realistic dreams. In fact that was one of the only things that kept me going through the break. Regardless I do not even remember a single dream I had. While I do feel slightly disappointed I am beyond excited to get stoned out of my brain tonight. I hope I get super high.,0
"Will a 2g blunt get 2 people zooted I'm picking up 3 grams tommorrow and a blunt wrap, and the night after that I'm meeting up with one of my good friends and we are going to roll about 2g into a blunt and save the extra g for use outside of the blunt. But I'm wondering will this 2g blunt get us both fucking baked (like fried) if we pretty much evenly split it, (I havent smoked for about a week for a tolerance break and I've always used bongs and bowls and this will be my first blunt, my friend has only smoked once off a dab cart, and got a little high but almost unnoticeable) of course though honestly I'm probably going to be smoking like 60% and he'll prolly be smoking about 40% since I'm more accustomed to it. Lmk what you guys think because I'm not very sure.

TLDR
will a 2g blunt alone get two low tolerance people totally fried or just normal high?",0

"Mom found my weed and I need help. I had some pretty good smelling weed in my room which was covered with a lot of bags, I thought nobody could smell it because I couldn’t at all but somehow she could smell it. Maybe I was just that used to it. It’s wasn’t much maybe a gram I was going to smoke it tomorrow but not then. I’m only 15, which I know I shouldn’t smoke weed at this age or whatever. But I’m still going to do it. I can’t really go out and do stuff with friends now because she doesn’t trust me and stuff. This isn’t the first time she’s caught me (found it before in my room like 6 months ago.) but this time she seemed really really really disappointed and me her don’t have a very good relationship anyways so. She said if I was caught with it by cops I would be in trouble and will not be able to go to college or get a job. She said you don’t know what weed does to your body because she is Uninformed (I guess that’s how you spell it lmao.) Also another reason is my dad was caught with it many many years back and got probation for it and he was involved in a wreck that killed his best friend because the roads were slippery and he has weed IN HIS SYSTEM. He had smoked a week prior to that. They tried to charge him with manslaughter with that. I live in Alabama so that’s why. She’s really disappointed in me and thinks that I’m going to become a bad kid or whatever. And she also thinks I’m going to need more and more weed to the point I need too much and I guess move over to other things? Been smoking for a year and only drank, smoke and took a xan or two. I’m not addicted to weed or feel the need to have it every day. I smoke in and off. I’ll smoke 3 days a week maybe. I just need advice and help please.",0

"Weird trip I was hitting some new shit with a friend of mine, had 2 J's I think. I didn't think they were hitting so I was taking some massive drags. Little did I know, apparently it was hitting fine. Cause before we finished passing the second one around, I was so fucked, I was sitting there just watching the trees in the background form into one color. I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. I remember asking them if I fell asleep I must've sounded like a fucking psycho cause it was like 15 seconds after I handed them a J. It felt like an hour or two for me. After that I just kinda sat there while they smoked the rest. Through the next 20 mins or so. My vision was fucked like it is when you get a blood rush. I was almost nauseous and got really dizzy when I stood up. I remember two images that would morph back from each other the whole time when I closed my eyes. One was a family portrait that hung in the living room of my house. And the other was the old red black and white buffalo sabres logo. To this day I have no idea what happened. I just assume it had something to do with the dope and my body cause they smoked the same thing and we're fine. Have you guys ever had something similar happen or know what that could've been.",0

The other night (Friday) I went to a party. I was drinking whisky at first and then I was offered some weed, so I was like hell yh and smoked the shit out of it. About 10 minutes later I started feeling really trippy. I started to feel like nothing was real like I wasn't real. Then I went and sat down for a bit and after I got up when I walked it was like I was teleporting about. I continued to drink and then I started to hear that people weren't actually saying. Well, I'm not sure if they were actually saying these things but I think it was something I hallucinated. I asked my older brother what it was and he said it was something called sycosis. I looked into what that sycosis is and it sounded like what I experienced but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After that night it has felt like I am still slightly detached from my mind and body and every so often I will feel like nothing is real. I have started to smoke a lot more than I'm used to if that helps.

"What's Your Top 3 Favorite Strains At The Moment And Why? Love this community of beautiful weed smokers, Ha-Ha.

Here's my three favorite strains at the moment, this list will be updated in a month or two as I try multiple new strains. 420 everyday my brothers and sisters. Post your favorite 3 down below and tell me why; lets share, why not. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Sativa) Laughing Buddha: makes you more giggly and personally makes me more talkative and focused, and a massive cerebral wave radiates from my body. Overall a great daytime strain, pure happiness and upbeat for hours. 

(Hybrid) Cookie Breath: This strain is a ""couch lock"" if you smoke a lot. It makes your body melt into whatever you're sitting or laying on; can be used for nighttime or daytime use. A blissful mood washes over your entire body - euphoric. 

(Indica) Casper OG: My favorite stain for sleeping at the moment, personally. It calms the mind and almost feels like it forces you to lay down, your mind is very, very calm. You hit the bed numb, euphoric and not wanting to move. You fall into a deep, relaxing sleep.",0

"Weed withdrawal? Hello guys I’m a 16 year old turning 17 in about a month, I have been using THC daily since around late last year and have recently quit due to some personal reasons. The exact date that I Quit was around June 26th. It is now July 7th and I have been experiencing Withdrawal symptoms such as paranoia, anxiety, nausea and appetite loss. I have noticed that I still sort of feel head high such as depersonalization as if I’m not there and light headed, making things seem surreal. This in turn is making me depressed that maybe it might be permanent. Is there anything to worry about or will it pass in time? I was mainly only using THC oils in the form of cartridges. Thanks again",0

"Anyone else get really bad cotton (dry) mouth? I never had this bad of an issue before. It would simply go away with water but now my cotton  mouth is soooo bad It’s like uncomfortably dry. It really makes me not want to smoke with people because of how bad my dry mouth gets. 

No matter what I smoke out of I get it, I have also tried different strains and still my dry mouth is embarrassingly bad. 

I have tried ; drinking water, chewing sugarless gum, soda, popsicles, mints. These all have helped but only temporarily I have to constantly drink water so much that it makes me pee a lot lol. Dry mouth comes back no matter what. 

Also - Ice (worked !! but makes my mouth extremely cold lol ) so unpractical. 

I don’t know if this also has anything to do with it but I’m also taking allergy medicine and Xanax from my dr so I think they both have a mouth drying effect.

"SWIM'S parents wont let him hang out with a certain friend TL/DR at bottom

So SWIM basically got busted by his parents, admitted a bong in his room was his friends and then now he cant hang out with him. How can he convince his parents (being underage aside), that he can hang out with him without showing interest to smoke again (even though we would be), just curious as to what you guys think the best option would be other than lying about where hes at (he's tried it, doesnt work for him) please help him out here. He thought about maybe convincing his parents his friend quite but doesnt know what to do for certain. Any help is greatly appreciated

"Weed teaches me. Im 17, I haven’t smoked pot very much, and I don’t smoke often at all, but then again, I’m probably too young to be smoking pot in the first place. I’d like to think of myself as pretty mature for my age, and while my friends are off their faces laughing and having fun, it seems that weed makes me hallucinate mildly. I have not done any drugs other than weed, but I get mild visuals both open and close eyed, more often than not while my eyes are opened. Every time it feels like those visuals try to teach me something or deliver me a message, most the time it is when music is playing. On the come up I almost always get a roller coaster visual that makes me believe that what the plant is trying to tell me is that I’m still at the beginning of the road but that I’m about to blast off because I do struggle with my sense of confidence a lot. I’ve also been shown myself on a stage a few times which it makes me feel better overall because I am an artist and it feels like it is telling me “you’ll make it, your hard work WILL pay off, just keep working”.  The high also lasts me much longer than my friends, feeling after effects for quite a while after smoking, up to days at a time, so I always smoke when I know I have nothing important to do for at least the next whole day. (Went to work once and it was wild, felt like I was high my whole shift”.  Don’t get me wrong I get a LOT of enjoyment and recreation off weed, and I know my shit isn’t laced (none of my friends hallucinate either) but it feels like weed often interrupts the “fun” in a good way, to teach me something or send me a message. Yeah that’s all I have I just thought I’d share it with all y’all! Peace. ❤️

"Weed &amp; Neurological disorders So for a little background, I am 19 and I have several neurological conditions, listed below

Tourette Syndrome

OCD

ADHD

Anxiety

Aspergers/Mild Autism-unofficial diagnosis, I have been told by several neurologists and therapists that I have it, but going thru the diagnosis process isn’t worth it since I don’t take medicine for anything.

So I have used marijuana for 8-10 months at this point, I never really smoke more than once or twice every 3 months. I have not taken any prescription medication for my neurological conditions in 6+ years, but I have noticed marijuana does have a profound effect on my conditions. 

After smoking, I have less noticeable tics from my TS, even tho my TS is already very mild. I also have an easier time dismissing obsessive thoughts and have less anxiety, I have yet to study my ADHD while high; however, I noticed I have higher social function when I am high. 
Those effects aside, I have also noticed some after effects when I loose the high…

For a period of 1-2 months after smoking I notice I can focus better, have less anxiety, and less issues with mood and my disorders. After some research, I believe this to be attributed to weed’s affects on serotonin levels. CBD acts like serotonin and THC has been reported to negatively effect the ability of serotonin reuptake. I believe this makes weed act like an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), resulting in increased free serotonin levels in my body for a period of time after smoking weed.

Please tell me your thoughts on the subject and post any questions you have for me. I’m just as curious as you may be about this!",0

"Creativity &gt; Disassociation Hi there! 1st posting here. 
I was wondering if anyone knows if there's any strains that won't induce so much depersonalization/derealization. I have mental illnesses, but smoking sometimes helps me to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. Helps me to write my mind out, too, which is great. But sometimes I get badly disassociated and it friggin sucks cuz I suffer from this, anyway. 
How can I take advantage of the good benefits and not feel awful at the same time? D:
I know this is a long shot, but I would love some advice.

"Ever since I ate an edible I’ve been feeling depressed. I know I have posted this question before I do apologize but I feel like I want more answers :( First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I’m saying, feeling like I’m not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I’m talking and it’s frustrating. I’m not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I’ve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it’s making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( I feel hopeless",0

"How do I get through an overdose? Hey everyone, first time user here. Yesterday I ate way more weed than I should’ve. Since I’m new at this, I still don’t know how to calculate how much is enough, and I ended up eating this edible without thinking. 

Next thing you know, I was in bed feeling like I’m going absolutely crazy. I had to call my friends, and I even think I had a psychotic episode. The worst part is... I feel like I’m still high and it’s been about 10 hours since I ate the edible. I still feel my heartbeat going way too fast. The hallucinations are gone, and I can form coherent sentences, but I still feel like I’m high. 

Should I be worried? Does anyone have any tips for getting over this? Or should I call a doctor or something?",0

For myself, i've been in the ballpark of about 3 times a day and a 4th every week for a pretty long time, but i'd be curious to see how other people's tolerances, preferences, circumstances, or just general inclination would differ from mine, especially with something as specific and varied as cannabis.

Side note, if you like i'd also be curious to know how much you think is best for someone who is a regular cannabis user, or how much you'd like to consume compared how much you do currently.",0

"Does weed make you lose weight? Some of my family members and family friends look very skinny, not anorexic, but skinny enough for others to notice and be concerned about. My cousins (family friends) look very pale, skinny, face sunken in a little. They smoke like fucking trains. Recently one of them had a baby and thankfully gained weight back so she looks a lot better now. Unless they're doing other drugs like popping pills along with smoking. 

I'd like to start smoking for my anxiety and honesty for fun as well. I obviously don't want to smoke every single day, just every once in a while. I have to approach this to my parents (I'm 18, still living a home obviously. Why wouldn't I get their permission?). My mom used to smoke when she was teenager, this back in the late 80s, early-mid 90s. So I'm pretty sure that the 1990 weed and 2019 weed are completely different now. More chemicals, I guess. Maybe they put chemicals in the plants to speed up the growing process and that's what makes people skinny? 

Anyways I'm just afraid that if I start smoking, I may lose a significant amount of weight. I'm only 120lbs, 5'5"" so put that into perspective.",0

"Fuck my life So after some time saving money i finally ordered my oil pen 2 days ago(thursday july 4).I did my research and ordered it from a well known supplier here in my country. In the courrier's app it said it will arrive on monday (july 8). The pen ended up  arriving today saturday (july 6). To my surprise,my mom wakes me up saying that a package has arrived for me. ""OH SHIT""was all i could think about  and she obviously saw it on my face.The doorman had called to notify about the package and she  had  recieved it...I planned on giving him(doorman) the heads-up to not give the package to ANYONE BUT ME and give him the shipping money , eventually...Since i still (in theory) had a few days left before it arrived.Long story short I told my mom the package that had arrived was a ps4 game as i went towards my bedroom.She came right behind me and asked me to open it and show it to her.So i did... I already knew i was fucked anyways...   
I Opened it and only showed the battery.She looked at the opened package and saw the cartidge's packaging that fucking says THC CANNABIS OIL all over it.

Fuck man... she was so fucking sad and pissed.
She returned to my room a few minutes later crying saying that this was too much for her and that she's worried about me.She asked me the whole worried-mom questions like ""You were smoking all these time,why do you do this? I cant trust you"" (she absolutely hates all drugs and never had to deal with any of these things in my family).It broke her heart.And in return it broke mine too.I've been a stoner for a few years now and i've always have been very obsessed about my family not catching me. My mom catched me like a year ago and i told her it was a one time thing.She gave me the benefit of the doubt i guess and gave me another chance.I fucking blew it in such a stupid way.What the fuck do i do now?

i started smoking at 13 with my brother, and it was fun, nights out in the back garden, but i stoped for a year. 
but recently i’ve been dealing with bad mental health issues, and i thaught weed might be able to help, as when i smoked for a few months when i was 13 it was pretty much the best time of my life, and i started smoking again, i got my friend into it and we both smoked everyday before school for weeks, it was great, but the last time i smoked with him was a week or so ago, and he had a seizure in mcdonals, but it was because he hadn’t ate the doctors said, so he stopped for a week, then on last monday we smoked a small polly joint before school and we was fine. but it’s currently saturday and i had a big haze and polly joint, and we was fine, but towards the end of the joint he started saying he was way too high, he seemed fine, but we got up and he was like i need to sit down, i looked over, he looked pale as a ghost, i start freaking out, then he’s he lays down, and stops talking to me, we are in a all way covered by bins so no one sees us, i whent to the shop like 15 mins ago for food as he had a seizure last time over not eating, and come back to him haven thrown up, i gave him the food but he hasnt ate, he’s had a swig of juice, and threw up again, so now we are both currently sat here. him laying in his puke. and me on my phone with nothing to do as he won’t speak to me or move, he’s fine, he’s not dead lol, because i keep saying ‘you ok’ and he says yeah so i know he’s alive. what the fuck do i do",0

"weed and introspection. an empiric study. I am a fairly extroverted guy and I love that about myself. I'm also as stupid as a beach towel and I hate that about myself. When I am sober I don t notice the stupid things I do and I ve lived in this state of just mindlessly enjoying life for about 6 months, since I ve stopped smoking weed. I stopped because it used to make me extremely introspective, to the point of simply not talking to anybody while high because I kept thinking about my own issues amd solutions for them. Last night I smoked, however and the usual happened: I started noticing all the social and personal mistakes I make and seeing how I could fix them. While I loved having access to this perspective after some time, when I woke up I felt absolutely miserable and my confidence hit rock bottom. Does anyone experience something similar? and if so, how do you balance it so that you reap all the benefits of weed induced introspection while keeping a positive outlook? cheers",0

"One time I got so high I couldn’t understand English anymore (sadly this is not a joke lol) So a while back, I went on a 3 month tolerance break, and upon coming back, I decided to take a fat. ass. bonger. This bonger fucked my shit, no joke, let me explain to you how this bonger made me unable to understand what people were saying. Something you should no first, is that my memory is notoriously bad when I’m high, but this time was different, my memory would only last for a couple of seconds at a time, it was so bad, I would forget entire sentences while they were being spoken to me. For example, one of my friends asked me “did you have a test yesterday” and I was just like “uuuuhhhh... what did you just say?” And they’d be like “did you have a test?” And I’d be like “when?” And they’d say “yesterday!” And then I would say “what happened yesterday?”. It was bad, I knew the words coming out of their mouths, but I couldn’t remember them long enough to form an actual sentence in my mind, so it just sounded like a bunch of words that had nothing to do with each other. At one point, someone would be talking to me, and then I would get hung up on something they said and then just think about it for like 15 seconds while they continued to talk, then when I was done thinking I would just walk away because I forgot that they were talking to me, then they’d come up and be like “wtf?” And I’d say “what?” and then he would say “I was talking to you” and I would just be like “really? When?”. Basically, for an hour and a half, I was trapped inside my mind and my shitty memory, my memory got so bad, that at one point, I thought I was stuck in a loop, because I would be listening to my friend talking to someone, then walk away, come back 2 mins later and that person is still talking to someone, I’d sit down and start listening, then I’d think “woah, I was just here listening to this exact convo” (which it wasn’t), I would then get up, walk away and come back to do it over again. And I have never been so zooked in my entire life since then, probably never will be.",0
"My first REAL experience As the title says, this would be the story of the first real time I’ve actually smoked weed. Before you ask, I’ve taken 1-2 hits off a bong or off a joint before this. Not enough to get me high or to actually really feel anything. Pretty much blue balls for getting high. 
.
.
Anyway, me and my friend were in his living room just relaxing. Asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said sure it why not. He rolled us up a blunt and went to town. After about 7-8 hits I really started to feel it. Now I’m no expert on weed or anything so I don’t know what kind of weed we were smoking. After I started to feel the high coming on, he kept talking to me and asking me questions but I couldn’t speak lol. I wanted to talk to him but I couldn’t physically bring myself to say anything at all. Like there was tape over my mouth or something. After a few more hits I decided I was high enough and stopped. I looked around and everything felt like I was in a play? Like none of this was real in a sense? It felt like people were watching us on tv or me and my friend were acting out a play. It was really weird but really cool. I guess the whole “were all in a simulation” theory. Then “I Fall Apart” by Post Malone came on and I bust into tears thinking about my ex. Idk why I cried. I felt like a wimp so after I got done crying I laughed extremely hard at myself ahaha. I could not stop laughing. Then I eventually passed out and woke up the next morning. Interesting night for sure lmao",0

"Honestly? Weed keeps me going. I’m a minor, and i tried smoking for a month, and i really loved it. I decided to pretty much stop until im off to college, because the stress of getting caught outweighed how relaxed i was from the bud, and smoking while young isnt the best for your brain.

And the thought of being able to collect pieces, to collect lighters, to roll joints, to try different strains, to smoke with someone i love, to go outdoors while baked, its something that gives me hope. It’s less about being drug crazed, and more about i cant wait for the freedom and peace and joy to come with this medicine. Weed is just one aspect that keeps me hopeful for the future, as well as being able to have pets, have my own space, have my own privacy, and to be a little bit more free.

"Marijuana helps me master my disability. Alright. It’s summer, and I have been smoking pretty frequently since school ended. My school does drug tests, so I have three months out of every year to completely embellish myself in every drug known to man before I return and drug tests begin again in the fall.

My most significant observation is the incredible effect of weed on my ADD. 

For all that don’t know, ADD (also known as Attention Deficit Disorder) affects ones ability to pay attention to pretty much everything all the time, making memory is difficult to retain. I take medication for this disorder, and that helps me focus, but as soon as I hit my buddy’s dab pen, I drift out of reality. 

Upon entering the reefer’s paradise, my ADD symptoms triple in efficiency. I can’t pay attention to anything for more than 5 seconds. My memory sucks. I’m crazy lazy. I might as well be a vegetable. 

But I’ve found that while I indulge in my high, I have the ability to tune anything I want out of my attention. I have literally mastered the art of my disability in that if someone is lecturing me or talking to me that I dislike, I can simply turn their volume off manually.

I need to know if other people have this ability or if I am the only one to experience this superpower.",0

I am a casual smoker. I tend to not finish my joint in 1 time and I tend to leave it for the next time. I have noticed that when i try to finish the joint the next day for example it is very hard to smoke it and it is nasty. It is as if I was smoking for the first time or something.

"Please help! My awful experience with weed... A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his friend. It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience...

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Here’s what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of the friend’s room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and his friend was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and unzipping their pants—in a sadistic, mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and his friend never did the pants stuff. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to the other guy, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions and we didn’t speak at all after the incident.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and remember the fear so deeply, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. I’ve always felt very in control of my reality on drugs and never saw anything that wasn’t really happening. 

Is it possible that weed can make you hallucinate like this? Could they have given me a different drug? Other things that happened during this episode were that I saw lights flashing on and off and blinds opening and closing at a rapid pace...basically everything was sped up like in fast forward motion. It scared me so bad, I thought I was dying. 

Please help! I’ve had so much trouble sleeping since then. I still have recurring dreams about being raped and have even started to question whether I was raped or sexually abused during my childhood and that’s why I had that reaction to the drugs, like maybe a suppressed memory or something. Or maybe there’s nothing wrong with me and I’m totally normal but they tricked me and accused me of hallucinating and now I’m starting to believe them... :(",0

"Interesting weed high. *Note: Sorry for bad grammar because a lot of things lol. I am using a phone, I don't speak English as a first language, and lastly I am kida high rn off a dab. 

So my co-worker and I got some really potent bud and rolled it as a joint and smoked the whole thing. It got me really messed up. Usually I can only get this high from like a 50mg edible but I guess the strain we smoked was really really strong so it had me and my co-worker blasted. Anyway he gets a call from his wife to pick her up from her work because her car isn't working, and he goes inside to get her while I stay in the car and move to the backend of the van where all our ladders and tools are and I have to sit on the floor. All of a sudden I see out of the side window my co-worker sprint to the car, and frantically opening the doors in the backend of the van and looking all scared and stuff at me. I shit my pants I suspected the cops somehow had followed us and because they smelled our joint and were now coming at us. He looked me dead in the eye, very very scared look on his face, and he said, ""Hey can I have my juice I think I left it back here... Oh there it is... Bye!"" Then he ran back. Two minutes later and he and his wife get back in and it was normal. We drive to the bank and I try to go in but end up going to wrong way and his wife is now laughing at me and pointing in the other direction (she knew I was baked). I went into the bank and went in line and stood there for 5 minutes waiting. I got super paranoid and thought every was looking at me becuase I look super high (my eyes are all red and squinted) and I then just turn around and leave the bank without doing anything with my money. We then go to his house for a minute. Now I don't drive my car to work, my co-worker picks me up from my house because it's faster. Anyway his wife offers me a ride home and I agree. It is then that we both have a super introspective and deep conversation all the way home. We both knew how stoned I was so we had a fun conversation about life, the world, the universe, cars, humankind, family stuff. Yeah and then she dropped me off at my house. That was 2 days ago.

"Question about pain and weed. So I have had chronic pain in my hand for a while now. I play guitar and my left hand can be a little bit tender sometimes. I went to physical therapy for a few months and it got better. During that time I was taking a long break from weed. Recently I smoked for the first time in about five months and all of a sudden my hand feels weird again. I googled it and found there is a link between weed and being more sensitive to pain. 

My question is this: what should I do? On the one hand playing guitar is something I’m really passionate about and I’m kind of hoping I can turn it into a career. On the other hand, I would like to occasionally enjoy a bowl without my hand hurting. I’m not a daily user, mainly on the weekends only. Any thoughts?",0

Sometimes the gummies have too much Jello, sometimes they’re too hard, sometimes they don’t harden at all. Any advice from experienced stoners on how to make the perfect pot gummy?",0

"Cannabis coconut oil---should I decarb before I put it in slow cooker?? Hi, 

I've been reading many recipes for making cannabis coconut oil and today I saw a recipe that don't require decarboxylation (for slow cooker method). 

&amp;#x200B;

 it says ""combine oil and cannabis in your slow cooker, and heat the two together on low or warm for a few hours. this allows for decarboxylation without scorching (which destroys the active ingredients)""-Leafy

&amp;#x200B;

I was always told to decarb first, so I don't know which one to trust. 

Does anyone NOT decarb first and just put them in in a slow cooker? that sounds so much easier",0

If any of you friendly pot heads have any advice please enlighten me.

"Brownies made with ground up weed This happened a few months ago but I think about it every once in awhile because it's really never happened before in my 10+ years of smoking..

I was at someones house and they asked if I wanted a brownie their friend had made. They swore they were super strong high quality. I took one and ate a bit and it tasted awful. They said their partner got so ripped on one and we should power through. I started inspecting the brownie and realized whoever made it literally just took ground up weed and tossed it in brownie batter. 

Eventually I just put it down and smoked a bowl but my sesh partner swore they felt really stoned and kept saying them doing things was because of the brownie. I felt zero effects other than the bowl I smoked.

I texted them the next day joking about how gross it tasted and they got offended and said them and their partner got super high so maybe it ""wasnt for me"". 

So - are people just throwing weed in their food? If you did, would you get ""super ripped""? I was always under the impression this didnt work unless the THC had a binding agent like the fats in butter. 

I dont even hang out with this person anymore but it was just weird at the time..",0

"Has anyone else experienced something like this? So up until two months ago I was a daily smoker. I stopped for a month because I was going to get tested for this job. Anyway after passing my drug test I’ve cut down on smoking.  I’ll smoke like 2-3x a week now. I smoked on Monday and everything was normal. However, yesterday I smoked only HALF a blunt and had the worst experience ever. My heart started pounding extremely fast to the point I thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. I also started feeling extremely hot. I did feel high but I was just more freaked out than anything. I started pacing around my room just telling myself to relax and that I was just tweaking hard. I’ve never had a panic/anxiety attack in my life, but I’m started to think that what I experience just that.  Has anyone else experience something like this? 

Also just want to point out that I shop from the same dealer and never had any of these side effects before.",0

"Tolerance break Hey all, I have been smoking weed a little too often these past couple of months, and now my tolerance is through the roof. A gram of weed makes me high for about 10 minutes, and that’s about it.

Now..

Due to medical reasons I explained the whole situation about weed to my gf and she said it was okay. Now I’m over here wanting to roll one up but idk how. Any suggestions? I’ve tried the vape pens (there okay) and edibles (I get wayyy too high.).",0

"My mom just ate my fucking edible. This is not a fucking drill!

So I was unpacking my thing in my room and I had my two weed cookies on top of my clothes in a Saran Wrap in my luggage so I had to take them out to get to my clothes. I put them on my bed and went to the bathroom. I’m such a fucking idiot. 

So she has this tendency to just eat people’s food is she sees it laying around which pisses off my dad and I. Like I didn’t think she would come in my room. I was freaking out when I heard her come in and was like “Gosh did you have to bring home your whole closet?”

I didn’t want to bring attention to the edibles since it was going to be suspicious so I just hoped she would notice it. 

Then I heard her say “Aww you brought me cookies?”

And I was like “No, sorry. They’re for me.” And she started getting offended for no reason and was like “You always have to be so selfish.” and blah blah blah lol.

I didn’t want to press it to much because I didn’t want her to think something was up with them and I was worried. 

Now I’m fucking screwed. Im just going to pretend like I don’t know what’s going on with her when it kicks in. I’ll say something like “Maybe you’re medication is acting up again.”. But I’m kind of scared because she literally never smoked or consumed weed except for that so-called time in college but I doubt she inhaled lol.

She’s going to freaking the fuck out. 

I’m just mad that she ate that shit and now I only have one left to enjoy... I had a dream this shit would happen.

I’ll update in like an hour.

I’m soooooo scared. She’s gonna be so fried. I only eat like a quarter and I smoke every day. Imagine her on a whole one and there was more than a gram in that cookie.... omfg. Fuck my life....

Update:

Okay so she’s literally normal. People keep asking what’s happening and... nothing is happening. I guess since she ate dinner it’s taking a while but I’m gonna say in the next 20 minutes she gonna feel it. I’ve been just casually peaking downstairs to check in on her. I do not want to be around when it hits tbh but I know I have to be since my dad is gonna be so confused lmao.

Meanwhile I’m smoking a roach in my bathroom lmaooo. 

**UPDATE**

Yooooo. She’s tweakinnnn.

I’m just laying in bed and I hear “Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Lawd have mercy! God help me!” 

Yoooo helppppo 

UPDATE

I’m laughing my fucking ass offffff I went downstairs and my dad is literally trying to hold her up bro. AHHHHHHH. Yo she’s gonee. She’s like “Me gettin heart palpations. Lawd help me.”” 😂😂😂😂 

Her eyes are red as shit oh my fuck

UPDATE

She’s find rn. She’s laying on the couch and quieted down. I think she’s going to just fall asleep. I gave her tea per her request and she not asking for food which is surprising. 

I’m playing Elvis music for her lmao and she’s loving it. 😂😂😂😂😂

UPDATE

She finally went up to her bed and let me help her up. Literally when her head hit that pillow she knocked the fuck out. 

We’re all going bed now. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring but yeah. Thanks for still around guys. I’ll update tomorrow (today).

And also thanks for all the likes. This shit blew up lmaoo. 

UPDATE (NEXT MORNING 7:16 am)

I woke up early cause I just do that shit and my dad is up I think but I haven’t heard my mom. She’s usually up at like 6. 

I’m guessing she’s still tired from it but I’m getting up to check on her. I feel like like my dad is gonna be pissed. Then again he doesn’t really know about weed edibles or anything.

A lot of fucking people are saying that I poisoned my mom. I did not poison my mom. You’re insane for saying that. These are EDIBLES not fucking arsenic. She ate them herself after I told her not to. READ THE POST. She was just high as hell but mellowed out after like an hour and a half. My family and I calmed her down and made her comfortable and she went to bed close to 1 am. 

I would never poison my mom. So people accusing me of that are ridiculous. My mom is fine and alive.

Lastly, I’m tired of people assuming my race and gender lmao. Maybe the majority of the people in this subreddit are white males but I’m a Black female. Okay? Lol. I’m her daughter. 

My parents are Jamaican but no they’re not one of those “One love. One heart. Let’s smoke together and feel alright.” type Jamaicans. So that’s why telling them about the edible is probably the worst thing to do. 

I’m not a terrible person. Accidents happen. I’m not the first person whose parent has eaten their edible. This is why you don’t eat people’s food after they tell you not to. Alright? Geez. (Now people are going to think I’m an asshole for saying that.)

UPDATE (7:50 AM)

My mom is finally awake and she looks GONE. Like her eyes are droopy. However she getting suspicious.

“I think who ever made those cookies needs to learn to bake.” Baaaahh

No, because you got baked af last night... I’ll stop. 

I don’t know how she still woke up early but I can tell she still feels it. She’s just confused and saying weird things. She’s also really uncoordinated and irritated. 

I’m debating if I should just tell her but I don’t want to give her a bad image of weed. The other day we were literally talking about the benefits of it and now she’s going to think it’s a terrible drug... know her she’ll think they were laced with some hard drug like coke or something. 

She’ll never forget this though...

UPDATE (9:13 AM)

BROOO MY FUCKING BROTHER. 

Okay so basically my brother started playing Broccoli by DRAM and my mom was like “Why you have to play something so vulgar.” and my brother was like “Mom, listen to the song. I think you can relate a little.” And she was still confused and I was trying to eye my brother like “Don’t tell her!”

Then he fucking says “You ate ate an edible.”

My mom: “What’s an edible?” 

My brother: “It’s like weed made into food and you ate a whole one last night.”

I hate this motherfucker brooooo.

She’s so pissed now. We had this whole ass argument while my brother thinks it’s funny.

This man stays getting me in trouble. Omfggggg. 

LAST UPDATE (11:56 AM)

So she’s sober now as far as I know. She’s still very pissed after finding out. I lied and said I threw the other one away (wondering why she didn’t ask for proof). 

Her exact words when my brother told her it was an edible we’re. “Ya better be lyin’, ya see! If that cookie had drugs it- Jesus, Lawd...”😩🍪

My brother: “It just had weed.”😆🍁

My mom: “People ah smoke weed an’ demma eat deh something too? Mm mm. No. What if me was dead? Eh? Suppose me have a heart attack?”😡🇯🇲

Me: “No one has died from weed.” 😂

My mom: “You look here, likkle girl 👧🏽. Me nah listen to any of ya foolishness. Ya bring that somethin in me house again and you gon see what’s in store fah you!!” 😡😡

Bruh. I had to write it exactly how she said it or else it isn’t as accurate nor funny. So she basically just yelled at me and threaten me. Lol. I honestly don’t give a fuck. 😈Probably gonna smoke in this house and bring weed cause ya girl needs her weed so. 🤷🏽‍♀️

By the end of the day, she’ll cool down and one day we’ll all laugh about this. Don’t leave your freaking edibles out kids! Some of you White people are lucky. Your mom would probably be like “You ought to not let this happen again, Christopher. You’re grounded for two days. This is a warning.”. Lol joking... don’t get offended lmao.

Alright, I’m done lol.

UPDATE (9:03 PM)

So I ate a quarter of the edible that was left and brooo. That shit kicked me in the ass in just 40 minutes. I’m so high.... I almost forgot to post this",0

"I decided to quit smoking I am a 21 year old recently graduated history teacher, and as far as I can remember from my college days, I have smoked a lot. It consumed much of my money and my humor, the taste, now that I come to think of it, is awful, and the smell just really bothers me in the nose.

Therefore, I have made a decision. Everytime I have money to buy cigarettes, I'll go out and buy some weed, because that'll finally get me to stop smoking these damn cigarettes.

"86 yr old grandmother finally said yes to edibles This is such a wholesome post but a bit long yet I'm so excited....
My husband's grandmother who is 86 yrs old (very religious  and law abiding but lives in an illegal state) has had bone spurs that have kept her in bed alot. She was on oxycodone for years at a high dose and went through full withdrawal when her insurance stopped covering. DESPERATE for relief. 
She finally said she wanted edibles and I live in a legal state so a family member came to visit and brought her back some, thinking it might not work.  WELL, she ate one and is walking around without her walker, eating sandwiches and laughing at the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" as I type this.
I am over the moon for her.",0

"How difficult was it to get your medical cannabis license in Florida? I'm setting up an appointment to get my medical marijuana license evaluation next month.

"Job interview popped up out of no where, how do I pass fast? I just had a job opportunity come up that pays more then double what I'm making now. The catch is that the only day they're interviewing people is in a week and they're doing drug test on site. I smoke 1-2 joints a day, sometimes a bong hit on top of that. I know that weight also matters, I was 285 when I started smoking a year ago and I'm down to 235 and still dropping weight.

If I do nothing but drink water (I drink lots anyway, love it) this week and run for an hour everyday is there even a chance I could pass?? Or is my best bet to get a clean sample and some sort of device.

Any help/ideas would be amazing. I would be so upset to miss this chance over something I do at home",0

How to tell the difference between CBD strains and THC strains? Recently it was the first time I've gotten ripped off.

Is there any way to tell the difference without smoking?,0

"I quit Vaping I quit Vaping and went back to smoking because no matter what form of Vaping i was doing it made me gag and cough. I even have a volcano so it isn't my device. Tried e juice, nope. Distillate, nope. And several crappy versions that are worse than smoking like Mct oil carts. Once got coconut oil when they claimed it was wax cartridge. 

Anything i try only tastes good for a second then I'm coughing a lung. And that burnt popcorn or beans taste is awful. Abv edibles taste terrible too.

I think it's unhealthy in comparison to smoking especially e juice and distillate, not enough research to say it's healthier especially with Vaping flavors and terpenes which in my experience terpenes burn easy and i mean bad burn. And Vaping dry herb feels like water vapor instead of actual cannabinoids

Smoking gets it all into you and Vaping gets you some then you have abv....it's a shame i wanted it to work. i actually use more herb Vaping then smoking and i get less high Vaping

Anyone else feel this way? 

I'm tired of coughing and getting barely high. I smoke a joint and I'm good for at least 2-3 hours but when i vape I'm like itching for relief within half an hour. By my math i can smoke .5 in five minutes and vape it in an hour. So clearly Vaping is not efficient.

I know I'm not doing it wrong because I've tried several devices and methods over five years. I'm finally done trying lol. Smoking tastes and feels better plus is faster.",0

"Concentrate inside or outside a joint? Which do you prefer? So I'm stoned and I'm contemplating dank joints and how they are made.

I was wondering what people think is the best method to roll a joint with concentrate (kief, wax, shatter, etc), inside the joint or outside, and why?

To answer my own question i feel like it's a waste to put concentrate on the outside because your smoking what's inside the joint not outside. I mean like I've rolled em that way and i never feel i get the full effect like when it's rolled inside. Sure it looks pretty outside and you can make art out of it but it's only gonna burn off and not really get in you. I'm sure some will but it's not efficient. Maybe it's better for sharing or hot boxing because it gets everywhere lol unlike when it's inside it kinda would go into one person in one fat rip and everyone else wouldn't get any. I've experienced this with friends.

So i like it inside (that's what she said!) Cuz i usually smoke alone and don't hot box anymore.

"Developing discipline/moderation? I’ve never had moderation with drugs or alcohol or anything else. Now that I’ve been sober for 3 years I’m starting to wonder if I can actually do things in moderation if I just try.

One thing I realized from coffee is that I’ll quit for months or even years and one day decide to go back and automatically start drinking it every day even multiple times.

Yesterday I drank a latte after 4 months off. I told myself I would have a latte once every two weeks from now on, and if I can do that for a year and it gets easier, then after a year I will try drinking alcohol or smoking weed once every 2-3 weeks.

I kind of wanted coffee again today but didn’t, and this is probably my first time going back to something and not having it again the next day so it’s already a big thing for me. I’m realizing that if I just set the goal I can actually do it.

My hope is that since I have 3 years off of weed and alcohol, I will be less dependent on it if I go back. Like I’ll be able to take it or leave it.

Do you think I can compare coffee to alcohol and weed, or will they be much more powerful in that I won’t be able to go the next day without it?",0

"weed made me hate my date and myself      i met up with this guy who ive been secretly talking to for the last few months for the second time yesterday. we both had our first kiss together the first time we met up. i really do think i loved him. and its crazy because i talk about it like it all happened years ago and it didnt. yesterday we met up again a second time and got high and all of a sudden i just started hating him for no reason. i didnt want him near me, i didnt want his arm around me or him close to my face. 
      i ended up feeling so bad that i ended our little date thing early because we just were sorta sitting in a little opening in a forest in complete silence. honestly it was a really scary high. i was paranoid and upset that i couldnt figure our why i was feeling so apathetic towards him, and then i started thinking about how i dont love anything, that i just might not be able to be chained down by a person or a relationship, and that i was meant to be free and a loner that would just live to have lots of experiences and stories to tell. 
     i understand that might not seem like a bad thing but it completely goes against everything i thought i wanted, and its like this dark cloud looming over me telling me i should just be alone. ive tried talking to him about just these complex and weird emotions ive been having the last two days and he just doesnt really seem to care about how i feel, albeit, hes also been insanely high himself. he usually gets like this while high.
    the thing is, this high was really weird for me though, not like what i usually feel and i havent quite experienced anything like it before so its just making it really hard to understand how much of it was something i should worry about and how much i should just shrug off and blame the weed on. 
     i just felt so disappointed in myself. like i kept getting these flashbacks to distant memories from my childhood i thought id forgotten and i would think about everything i thought i would be when i was my age now and what i thought i was going to be like as a child is nothing like how ive turned out. i feel like an embarrassment and that i ruin everybody.",0

It hit hard so I didn’t question it at all. But after getting a few others (a total of five over time) I noticed each actual cartridge was different as 4/5 of them said CCELL on it. Not just that but a few of them had different text sizes so each CCELL looked different on each cartridge. They all get me blasted though which has me guessing.

"What to do if child accidently injests edibles? So Im a nanny and the mother (my boss) owns and runs her own hemp farm/CBD bussiness start up. We're both marijuana friendly but of course, the kids (11, 8, 4, 3) arent exposed to weed, edibles, smoking, etc. 


That being said, accidents happen. What should I do if one of the kids happen into their moms stash? Maybe they think a candy or edible or one of her bussiness products is just that, not realizing what is really in it. 


Ive tried Google, but everywhere says rush them to the ER and prepare for CPS and child services and the police, etc. A lot of the info is fear mongering anti-marijuana drivel telling parents to rifle through their teenagers rooms for candy.


I'm just looking for realistic expectations of what would happen so I could respond quickly and efficiently.",0

"Marijuana Possession charge... I do not know what to do. Hey guys, I was arrested yesterday in NJ for having less than 1 gram of bud. I am 25, still living with my parents after graduating college. I was sitting in my car after work and decided to roll one up in the parking lot (stupid mistake I know). The state police snuck up to my window and caught me in the process, so I did not have time to hide the evidence. I was then put in in handcuffs and taken to the station to get processed. I am due to appear in court in about 2 weeks. I was wondering if there's any way I can ask for conditional discharge without an attorney as I cannot afford one at the moment. This is my first offense and I have no criminal record. Should I plead not guilty and ask for a public defender? Should I just go by myself and stick it out? I have never been to court before so I do not know what to expect.

"Still feel weird 3 days after smoking Hey everyone! 
Decided to ask here before totally freaking out and going to the doctor. I smoked from a bong about 3 days ago and am still feeling numbness in my body and a general feeling of disconnection, floatiness and brain fog. I feel sort of ""out of it"" and not like myself. 

Some background info: I've only smoked a couple of times before. When I smoke after drinking I experience memory loss for the period after the weed kicks in. I also had a severe panic attack the first time I had edibles(there was way too much in them obviously) where I was tripping balls and thought I was dying(ended up calling 911). Now leading up to this moment, I've smoked like 3 times within a week. 2 of those times were a bad experience(though not as bad as the edibles experience) and I got close to having a full-blown panic attack when I smoked from the bong 3 days ago. 

My question is whether this is something I should see a doctor for or if I should wait longer for these symptoms to go away on their own?",0

"Worst high of my life so far. Iv been smoking some what regularly for a little over a year now . earlier today I smoked like I usually do, the usual amount. at first I was having fun I made myself a late breakfast and watched some youtube videos I was having a good time. At like the 45 min mark I was having a horrible time. my mind kept racing I couldn't concentrate on one thing. So as my mind kept thinking my thoughts really got out of control. I didn't feel like myself. I felt as if everything I had ever known even myself was complexity fabricated. Nothing seemed real in the slightest bit and I was having a hard time coming to terms with it.  That was the worst part of my experience this time I couldn't understand why life was real, or who I was, nothing in the world we lived in made sense. I thought maybe I was too high and watched a video and everything the lady said in the video made it worse. So its a little while later and I decide to go my room so I could sleep it off. I just wanted it to be over. But then I couldn't get comfortable what so ever. eventually I did after I freaked out some more. I turned on some music and fell asleep. when found some songs that didn't provoke my mind to think about any and everything.

Usually I'll be home alone and start sparking up and I'll be able to chill n do whatever I wanted, I would even go for a walk. 

In the past couple of weeks, however I've found I've been paranoid to the point I've believed that I've been followed by multiple people and that they're all connected and following me. 

I know this is obviously stupid and the logic in my brain tries to overrule it but it just doesn't happen. Even when I'm alone I'll sit and worry myself into a stupid hole.

I'll wait it out and an hour or so later the CBD kicks in and I'm all good, chillin n everything. I'm just wondering if anyone has an understanding of what I'm dealing with, whether it's my own problem that is amplified by smoking or whether I should cut weed out for a bit or even if when I'm smoking I should smoke more so that I'm hit with more CBD initially which will mellow me out to start? 

As you can see I'm quite unsure so any help would be appreciated, hopefully if anyone else is struggling with this and just wants to chill they'll be able to help themselves too!

"Can make thc stored in your body fat make you high? I'm not a native English speaker, so some sentences might not be completely correct. 
I was recently at some kind of festival and I had a couple beers and a bit of nicotine afterwards I was dancing for about 2h straight. After I went home I felt a bit high after  feeling sober for like 1h after the nicotine and alcohol. I once read that you can fail a thc test after doing sports even though you smoked weed months before because some thc might be stored in your body fats. I accidentally drank the part with the most butter from a thc tea so I probably hat thc from like 7g of weed therefore I got really fried and I ate a lot.
 My theory is, that I had a lot of thc in my fat and I lost it while dancing to get high afterwards. It might be placebo but it really felt like being high.",0

"Smoking weed ruined my life I live in a country in which weed isn’t legal so you have to get it from dealers without rly knowing what substances are actually  inside the pot you’re buying. I never bought weed but I used to smoke my friends’ and every time everything played out as I expected it to: I got high, it felt amazing and a few hours later I was back to being my usual  self. 

Well that I was until I smoked with these friends that I’m not very close with for the first time, it was this shitty-looking hash that I’m almost certain was laced with some crap cos I had a massive panic attack while on it, had an awful headache accompanied by nausea and terrible brain fog and the worst part was that I smoked it about three weeks ago and I feel like I never properly came down from that high. I’ve become retarded since then, I can’t make logical connections, I lose any train of thought I start and I find it hard to express myself verbally. The friends I chilled with are known as my school’s stoners and I thought they were all fried because of the huge amount of thc they put inside their bodies everyday but now I understand that the thc’s not the one to blame given that the weed they usually have is defs laced. 

I smoked it during my summer break before 12th grade, which hasnt ended yet, and I know for a fact that my grades will drop from As to Ds next year, I ruined my dreams of studying abroad and becoming a doctor. My life’s over, I’ve been feeling suicidal cos of this.",0

"i need somes advices guys please so, basically i'm a french-guy and i used to smoke weed with somes friends back in high-school

Now i'm grown-up, and most of my friends went-away

I got a job, i work everydays, it's a pretty physical one too

And i got pretty-shitty superiors who do nothing all-day long,

But still manage to throw shit at me for coming 10-minutes lates one-day in the span of 9 months

It's tiring, and my life as been stressful for some-times now

So i just want to blow some steam-off at the end of the week basically

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been thinking of smoking weed again

The thing is:

\-i absolutely hate tobacco

\-and my friends went-away and we stopped talking since years because we all had to do our lifes separated

&amp;#x200B;

I still take somes news from them, because i want to keep contact and know if they're having a good-life

It would be extremely awkward and insincere from me to just straight-up ask them to put me in contact with somes dealers near my location

&amp;#x200B;

So basically

I've been thinking about growing weed

It's illegal to smoke, or grow-it here, but it's not illegal to buy seeds

Don't ask-me why, it's stupid, that's all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty alright at gardening flowers, fruits, and vegetables

So i think it wouldn't be too hard for me

But i have no ideas what kind of seeds i should-buy, or how to make-it grow

When the plant will be grown-up, how do i ""extract""-it?

And how should i consume it, i don't really want to go back to smoke with cigs, i hate-it

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be alright to just buy the ""finished-product"" from someone

But since it's reddit, i guess most of you guys are not in France, which would make it impossible

And it would probably be illegal and i wouldn't want to put anyone in troubles for this",0

"Eye twitch ? Hi guys,

So i'm vaping concentrate (only 3 puffs at night before going to sleep) and I usually get the rose gold from Bloom farms. Now about a month ago my dispensary advised me to try Unwind from Ace extracts and after smoking it I developped a left eye twitch.

What I notice is if I don't smoke for like 2 days, the eye twitch goes away and if I smoke, sure enough the next morning it comes back.

Do you think it's something in the Ace extracts product that might trigger this or is it weed in general? I've been smoking weed for years and never had this before but maybe I'm getting older and that's what weed does to me now.

I'll definitely get back to rose gold after I finish to use the Unwind but was wondering if any of you had experience with this issue.

"My heart almost stopped after smoking weed. Recently around a month ago I was hospitalized for smoking weed, i smoked out of a vaporizer which I found out later had to do with it. This particular vape hit really hard and always had you high to the point where you’d be so lazy that you wish you could move but you couldn’t.
 After I’m done, maybe around 20 minutes, my heart starts beating so fast that my chest starts feeling hot to the touch and I start getting the symptoms of a heart attack, I am young and my heart has always been healthy and stable. My jaw started to feel weird and my whole left side went limp and it felt like my bicep was being pulled apart from end to end. It was so intense that I thought I could be having a Charlie horse. 
It had got so intense that I had to go to the hospital and I’m not like any of those people who gets so high that they go to the hospital because there scared, no there was actually something wrong.
But it was only till after the hospital visit I learned that my heart could of actually stopped. I have an app on my phone called heart rate free and it’s 100% accurate (I tested it at the hospital with the machine next to me) and before I even thought about going to the hospital it read 175 bmp which was very dangerous for me to have been laying down doing nothing. It had been going for hours and  I was scared I had a blood clot or something was wrong with my heart. But it was just doing its job because when I got to the hospital and they ran blood tests I found out the large amounts of thc in my system were making me dehydrated and thickening up my blood making my heart work way harder than it needed to. If I would’ve stayed at home I could’ve had a heart attack and died cause that was was slowly happening. My heart needed to beat faster to get more blood to my organs but I found out the faster it went the more blood and hydration it would need but since I was dried up it was basically doing everything it could to stay alive. The hospital realized this and quickly put fluids in me and re-hydrated me which is when my heart rate of 190 went down to 100 which is how they double checked from the blood tests that it was the problem because my heart stated to calm down after it. They told me to be careful and sent me home where it went down even more from that. 

What I’m saying is that nobody can die from weed but you can die from dehydration. And  It still scares me to this day knowing that I could’ve died from it. I haven’t smoked weed since and I’m not planning too because hours of constant beating at high Bpm’s can really affect your hearts health and I’m worried if it happens again I won’t be able to live to tell the story again. Be safe when smoking large amounts and especially if your hot boxing bring as much water as you can. Believe it or not it could save your life.

My intention was to put some hybrid / sativa based oil Double Delicious (Seattle supplier)  into my own cookies and such. I've recently moved to the UK and bought a vape pen and put some of the oil in the pen. However I think that the guy at the pot shop told me the wrong info because on the back of the packaging it says that there is coconut oil in this item and says for external use only. So I think the shit I bought is a topical oil.

- did I just fuck up my vape pen by putting a topical oil in it?

- are there negative health affects by vaping a topical oil?

I have been smoking for something close to 10 years now. I tried to quit but, even after almost 4 months of absolute abstinence I did not see any benefits. 

I mean the short term memory improved , but I was so tense and sleepless and pissed off that the total effect was negative.

Looks like i am one of those who need to smoke to function. 

Well I want to come out with it and stop hiding and just smoke whenever I want.

But the problem is that weed is considered illegal in my country. 

I mean I can make it legal just for me as a medicine, but still being a pothead is frown upon.

5.Put in the oven at 300F for 20 minute.

"The Boundy Buds So this is a story about some friends of mine, about a ""strain"" that we smoked for awhile that was wack. So a guy named Boundy grows weed, the weed is called boundy bud and from my short experience is full skitz, now I've done my fair share of psychedelics so weed now is still just a one way ticket to a trip, I was there for one of these events and heard about the other last night, first event was with a mate who we will call Tom asked me to pack him a phat cone and I did, he was already pretty stoned and we had a new massive party sized cone piece, so he punched the cone pulled it through was fine, maybe an hour passes and he asks for another this is where shit hits the fan a bit, I packed it to the rim was a bit bigger than the last one but i thought he would be fine but yeah nah, punches it pull it through looks like hes gonna green, i was thinking she'll be right, he was on the ground at this point and gets up stumbling around and blacks out falling smashing his head into a wood been a cutting his face up pretty bad then well having a seizure for no longer than 5 seconds, full fucked, he was alright after just really out of it but we took care of him and having his girlfriend there helping him out all night, he was fine  and still smokes weed.
So I asked him about it and he said it had happened before on the same strain maybe two weeks prior, got me thinking that it wasn't him hitting his head that caused it and more evidence has come to light, so this other mate we will call Ted had apparently been punching cones all night asked for one more and had blacked out and had a seizure as well for again no longer than 5 seconds.
Sharing this to get any more ideas on why it might have happened.",0

About to break a 5 day t-break. Aren’t you supposed to have crazy dreams? I’ve been a relatively heavy smoker for around two years now and this was my first ever tolerance break. It was actually not as difficult as I thought it would be. The only “symptom” I experienced were a slight high temper. I am disappointed though that I did not have any hyper realistic dreams. In fact that was one of the only things that kept me going through the break. Regardless I do not even remember a single dream I had. While I do feel slightly disappointed I am beyond excited to get stoned out of my brain tonight. I hope I get super high.,0
"Will a 2g blunt get 2 people zooted I'm picking up 3 grams tommorrow and a blunt wrap, and the night after that I'm meeting up with one of my good friends and we are going to roll about 2g into a blunt and save the extra g for use outside of the blunt. But I'm wondering will this 2g blunt get us both fucking baked (like fried) if we pretty much evenly split it, (I havent smoked for about a week for a tolerance break and I've always used bongs and bowls and this will be my first blunt, my friend has only smoked once off a dab cart, and got a little high but almost unnoticeable) of course though honestly I'm probably going to be smoking like 60% and he'll prolly be smoking about 40% since I'm more accustomed to it. Lmk what you guys think because I'm not very sure.

TLDR
will a 2g blunt alone get two low tolerance people totally fried or just normal high?",0

"Mom found my weed and I need help. I had some pretty good smelling weed in my room which was covered with a lot of bags, I thought nobody could smell it because I couldn’t at all but somehow she could smell it. Maybe I was just that used to it. It’s wasn’t much maybe a gram I was going to smoke it tomorrow but not then. I’m only 15, which I know I shouldn’t smoke weed at this age or whatever. But I’m still going to do it. I can’t really go out and do stuff with friends now because she doesn’t trust me and stuff. This isn’t the first time she’s caught me (found it before in my room like 6 months ago.) but this time she seemed really really really disappointed and me her don’t have a very good relationship anyways so. She said if I was caught with it by cops I would be in trouble and will not be able to go to college or get a job. She said you don’t know what weed does to your body because she is Uninformed (I guess that’s how you spell it lmao.) Also another reason is my dad was caught with it many many years back and got probation for it and he was involved in a wreck that killed his best friend because the roads were slippery and he has weed IN HIS SYSTEM. He had smoked a week prior to that. They tried to charge him with manslaughter with that. I live in Alabama so that’s why. She’s really disappointed in me and thinks that I’m going to become a bad kid or whatever. And she also thinks I’m going to need more and more weed to the point I need too much and I guess move over to other things? Been smoking for a year and only drank, smoke and took a xan or two. I’m not addicted to weed or feel the need to have it every day. I smoke in and off. I’ll smoke 3 days a week maybe. I just need advice and help please.",0

"Weird trip I was hitting some new shit with a friend of mine, had 2 J's I think. I didn't think they were hitting so I was taking some massive drags. Little did I know, apparently it was hitting fine. Cause before we finished passing the second one around, I was so fucked, I was sitting there just watching the trees in the background form into one color. I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. I remember asking them if I fell asleep I must've sounded like a fucking psycho cause it was like 15 seconds after I handed them a J. It felt like an hour or two for me. After that I just kinda sat there while they smoked the rest. Through the next 20 mins or so. My vision was fucked like it is when you get a blood rush. I was almost nauseous and got really dizzy when I stood up. I remember two images that would morph back from each other the whole time when I closed my eyes. One was a family portrait that hung in the living room of my house. And the other was the old red black and white buffalo sabres logo. To this day I have no idea what happened. I just assume it had something to do with the dope and my body cause they smoked the same thing and we're fine. Have you guys ever had something similar happen or know what that could've been.",0

The other night (Friday) I went to a party. I was drinking whisky at first and then I was offered some weed, so I was like hell yh and smoked the shit out of it. About 10 minutes later I started feeling really trippy. I started to feel like nothing was real like I wasn't real. Then I went and sat down for a bit and after I got up when I walked it was like I was teleporting about. I continued to drink and then I started to hear that people weren't actually saying. Well, I'm not sure if they were actually saying these things but I think it was something I hallucinated. I asked my older brother what it was and he said it was something called sycosis. I looked into what that sycosis is and it sounded like what I experienced but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After that night it has felt like I am still slightly detached from my mind and body and every so often I will feel like nothing is real. I have started to smoke a lot more than I'm used to if that helps.

"What's Your Top 3 Favorite Strains At The Moment And Why? Love this community of beautiful weed smokers, Ha-Ha.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my three favorite strains at the moment, this list will be updated in a month or two as I try multiple new strains. 420 everyday my brothers and sisters. Post your favorite 3 down below and tell me why; lets share, why not. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Sativa) Laughing Buddha: makes you more giggly and personally makes me more talkative and focused, and a massive cerebral wave radiates from my body. Overall a great daytime strain, pure happiness and upbeat for hours. 

(Hybrid) Cookie Breath: This strain is a ""couch lock"" if you smoke a lot. It makes your body melt into whatever you're sitting or laying on; can be used for nighttime or daytime use. A blissful mood washes over your entire body - euphoric. 

(Indica) Casper OG: My favorite stain for sleeping at the moment, personally. It calms the mind and almost feels like it forces you to lay down, your mind is very, very calm. You hit the bed numb, euphoric and not wanting to move. You fall into a deep, relaxing sleep.",0

"Weed withdrawal? Hello guys I’m a 16 year old turning 17 in about a month, I have been using THC daily since around late last year and have recently quit due to some personal reasons. The exact date that I Quit was around June 26th. It is now July 7th and I have been experiencing Withdrawal symptoms such as paranoia, anxiety, nausea and appetite loss. I have noticed that I still sort of feel head high such as depersonalization as if I’m not there and light headed, making things seem surreal. This in turn is making me depressed that maybe it might be permanent. Is there anything to worry about or will it pass in time? I was mainly only using THC oils in the form of cartridges. Thanks again",0

No matter what I smoke out of I get it, I have also tried different strains and still my dry mouth is embarrassingly bad. 

I have tried ; drinking water, chewing sugarless gum, soda, popsicles, mints. These all have helped but only temporarily I have to constantly drink water so much that it makes me pee a lot lol. Dry mouth comes back no matter what. 

Also - Ice (worked !! but makes my mouth extremely cold lol ) so unpractical. 

I don’t know if this also has anything to do with it but I’m also taking allergy medicine and Xanax from my dr so I think they both have a mouth drying effect.

"Weed teaches me. Im 17, I haven’t smoked pot very much, and I don’t smoke often at all, but then again, I’m probably too young to be smoking pot in the first place. I’d like to think of myself as pretty mature for my age, and while my friends are off their faces laughing and having fun, it seems that weed makes me hallucinate mildly. I have not done any drugs other than weed, but I get mild visuals both open and close eyed, more often than not while my eyes are opened. Every time it feels like those visuals try to teach me something or deliver me a message, most the time it is when music is playing. On the come up I almost always get a roller coaster visual that makes me believe that what the plant is trying to tell me is that I’m still at the beginning of the road but that I’m about to blast off because I do struggle with my sense of confidence a lot. I’ve also been shown myself on a stage a few times which it makes me feel better overall because I am an artist and it feels like it is telling me “you’ll make it, your hard work WILL pay off, just keep working”.  The high also lasts me much longer than my friends, feeling after effects for quite a while after smoking, up to days at a time, so I always smoke when I know I have nothing important to do for at least the next whole day. (Went to work once and it was wild, felt like I was high my whole shift”.  Don’t get me wrong I get a LOT of enjoyment and recreation off weed, and I know my shit isn’t laced (none of my friends hallucinate either) but it feels like weed often interrupts the “fun” in a good way, to teach me something or send me a message. Yeah that’s all I have I just thought I’d share it with all y’all! Peace. ❤️

"Weed &amp; Neurological disorders So for a little background, I am 19 and I have several neurological conditions, listed below

Tourette Syndrome

OCD

ADHD

Anxiety

Aspergers/Mild Autism-unofficial diagnosis, I have been told by several neurologists and therapists that I have it, but going thru the diagnosis process isn’t worth it since I don’t take medicine for anything.

So I have used marijuana for 8-10 months at this point, I never really smoke more than once or twice every 3 months. I have not taken any prescription medication for my neurological conditions in 6+ years, but I have noticed marijuana does have a profound effect on my conditions. 

After smoking, I have less noticeable tics from my TS, even tho my TS is already very mild. I also have an easier time dismissing obsessive thoughts and have less anxiety, I have yet to study my ADHD while high; however, I noticed I have higher social function when I am high. 
Those effects aside, I have also noticed some after effects when I loose the high…

For a period of 1-2 months after smoking I notice I can focus better, have less anxiety, and less issues with mood and my disorders. After some research, I believe this to be attributed to weed’s affects on serotonin levels. CBD acts like serotonin and THC has been reported to negatively effect the ability of serotonin reuptake. I believe this makes weed act like an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), resulting in increased free serotonin levels in my body for a period of time after smoking weed.

Please tell me your thoughts on the subject and post any questions you have for me. I’m just as curious as you may be about this!",0

I was wondering if anyone knows if there's any strains that won't induce so much depersonalization/derealization. I have mental illnesses, but smoking sometimes helps me to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. Helps me to write my mind out, too, which is great. But sometimes I get badly disassociated and it friggin sucks cuz I suffer from this, anyway. 
How can I take advantage of the good benefits and not feel awful at the same time? D:

"Ever since I ate an edible I’ve been feeling depressed. I know I have posted this question before I do apologize but I feel like I want more answers :( First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I’m saying, feeling like I’m not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I’m talking and it’s frustrating. I’m not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I’ve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it’s making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( I feel hopeless",0

Next thing you know, I was in bed feeling like I’m going absolutely crazy. I had to call my friends, and I even think I had a psychotic episode. The worst part is... I feel like I’m still high and it’s been about 10 hours since I ate the edible. I still feel my heartbeat going way too fast. The hallucinations are gone, and I can form coherent sentences, but I still feel like I’m high.

For myself, i've been in the ballpark of about 3 times a day and a 4th every week for a pretty long time, but i'd be curious to see how other people's tolerances, preferences, circumstances, or just general inclination would differ from mine, especially with something as specific and varied as cannabis.

Side note, if you like i'd also be curious to know how much you think is best for someone who is a regular cannabis user, or how much you'd like to consume compared how much you do currently.",0

"Does weed make you lose weight? Some of my family members and family friends look very skinny, not anorexic, but skinny enough for others to notice and be concerned about. My cousins (family friends) look very pale, skinny, face sunken in a little. They smoke like fucking trains. Recently one of them had a baby and thankfully gained weight back so she looks a lot better now. Unless they're doing other drugs like popping pills along with smoking. 

I'd like to start smoking for my anxiety and honesty for fun as well. I obviously don't want to smoke every single day, just every once in a while. I have to approach this to my parents (I'm 18, still living a home obviously. Why wouldn't I get their permission?). My mom used to smoke when she was teenager, this back in the late 80s, early-mid 90s. So I'm pretty sure that the 1990 weed and 2019 weed are completely different now. More chemicals, I guess. Maybe they put chemicals in the plants to speed up the growing process and that's what makes people skinny? 

Anyways I'm just afraid that if I start smoking, I may lose a significant amount of weight. I'm only 120lbs, 5'5"" so put that into perspective.",0

"Fuck my life So after some time saving money i finally ordered my oil pen 2 days ago(thursday july 4).I did my research and ordered it from a well known supplier here in my country. In the courrier's app it said it will arrive on monday (july 8). The pen ended up  arriving today saturday (july 6). To my surprise,my mom wakes me up saying that a package has arrived for me. ""OH SHIT""was all i could think about  and she obviously saw it on my face.The doorman had called to notify about the package and she  had  recieved it...I planned on giving him(doorman) the heads-up to not give the package to ANYONE BUT ME and give him the shipping money , eventually...Since i still (in theory) had a few days left before it arrived.Long story short I told my mom the package that had arrived was a ps4 game as i went towards my bedroom.She came right behind me and asked me to open it and show it to her.So i did... I already knew i was fucked anyways...   
I Opened it and only showed the battery.She looked at the opened package and saw the cartidge's packaging that fucking says THC CANNABIS OIL all over it.

Fuck man... she was so fucking sad and pissed.
She returned to my room a few minutes later crying saying that this was too much for her and that she's worried about me.She asked me the whole worried-mom questions like ""You were smoking all these time,why do you do this? I cant trust you"" (she absolutely hates all drugs and never had to deal with any of these things in my family).It broke her heart.And in return it broke mine too.I've been a stoner for a few years now and i've always have been very obsessed about my family not catching me. My mom catched me like a year ago and i told her it was a one time thing.She gave me the benefit of the doubt i guess and gave me another chance.I fucking blew it in such a stupid way.What the fuck do i do now?

but recently i’ve been dealing with bad mental health issues, and i thaught weed might be able to help, as when i smoked for a few months when i was 13 it was pretty much the best time of my life, and i started smoking again, i got my friend into it and we both smoked everyday before school for weeks, it was great, but the last time i smoked with him was a week or so ago, and he had a seizure in mcdonals, but it was because he hadn’t ate the doctors said, so he stopped for a week, then on last monday we smoked a small polly joint before school and we was fine. but it’s currently saturday and i had a big haze and polly joint, and we was fine, but towards the end of the joint he started saying he was way too high, he seemed fine, but we got up and he was like i need to sit down, i looked over, he looked pale as a ghost, i start freaking out, then he’s he lays down, and stops talking to me, we are in a all way covered by bins so no one sees us, i whent to the shop like 15 mins ago for food as he had a seizure last time over not eating, and come back to him haven thrown up, i gave him the food but he hasnt ate, he’s had a swig of juice, and threw up again, so now we are both currently sat here. him laying in his puke. and me on my phone with nothing to do as he won’t speak to me or move, he’s fine, he’s not dead lol, because i keep saying ‘you ok’ and he says yeah so i know he’s alive. what the fuck do i do",0

"weed and introspection. an empiric study. I am a fairly extroverted guy and I love that about myself. I'm also as stupid as a beach towel and I hate that about myself. When I am sober I don t notice the stupid things I do and I ve lived in this state of just mindlessly enjoying life for about 6 months, since I ve stopped smoking weed. I stopped because it used to make me extremely introspective, to the point of simply not talking to anybody while high because I kept thinking about my own issues amd solutions for them. Last night I smoked, however and the usual happened: I started noticing all the social and personal mistakes I make and seeing how I could fix them. While I loved having access to this perspective after some time, when I woke up I felt absolutely miserable and my confidence hit rock bottom. Does anyone experience something similar? and if so, how do you balance it so that you reap all the benefits of weed induced introspection while keeping a positive outlook? cheers",0

How long do you think it will take me to pass an urine test if I quit today, after four weeks? Thanks in advance!",0
"Ever been so high? My friend, after a few fat bong rips thought that he was abstracting himself from reality even more, to the point that he will die. He proceeded to sleep a few minutes on the ground, and then went to the toilet. OK, everything is nice and fine. But why did be go to the toilet? Well because for him it felt like he was shitting and pissing himself all the time while lying on the ground. He spent the next 30 minutes on the toilet.

"One time I got so high I couldn’t understand English anymore (sadly this is not a joke lol) So a while back, I went on a 3 month tolerance break, and upon coming back, I decided to take a fat. ass. bonger. This bonger fucked my shit, no joke, let me explain to you how this bonger made me unable to understand what people were saying. Something you should no first, is that my memory is notoriously bad when I’m high, but this time was different, my memory would only last for a couple of seconds at a time, it was so bad, I would forget entire sentences while they were being spoken to me. For example, one of my friends asked me “did you have a test yesterday” and I was just like “uuuuhhhh... what did you just say?” And they’d be like “did you have a test?” And I’d be like “when?” And they’d say “yesterday!” And then I would say “what happened yesterday?”. It was bad, I knew the words coming out of their mouths, but I couldn’t remember them long enough to form an actual sentence in my mind, so it just sounded like a bunch of words that had nothing to do with each other. At one point, someone would be talking to me, and then I would get hung up on something they said and then just think about it for like 15 seconds while they continued to talk, then when I was done thinking I would just walk away because I forgot that they were talking to me, then they’d come up and be like “wtf?” And I’d say “what?” and then he would say “I was talking to you” and I would just be like “really? When?”. Basically, for an hour and a half, I was trapped inside my mind and my shitty memory, my memory got so bad, that at one point, I thought I was stuck in a loop, because I would be listening to my friend talking to someone, then walk away, come back 2 mins later and that person is still talking to someone, I’d sit down and start listening, then I’d think “woah, I was just here listening to this exact convo” (which it wasn’t), I would then get up, walk away and come back to do it over again. And I have never been so zooked in my entire life since then, probably never will be.",0
"My first REAL experience As the title says, this would be the story of the first real time I’ve actually smoked weed. Before you ask, I’ve taken 1-2 hits off a bong or off a joint before this. Not enough to get me high or to actually really feel anything. Pretty much blue balls for getting high. 
.
.
Anyway, me and my friend were in his living room just relaxing. Asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said sure it why not. He rolled us up a blunt and went to town. After about 7-8 hits I really started to feel it. Now I’m no expert on weed or anything so I don’t know what kind of weed we were smoking. After I started to feel the high coming on, he kept talking to me and asking me questions but I couldn’t speak lol. I wanted to talk to him but I couldn’t physically bring myself to say anything at all. Like there was tape over my mouth or something. After a few more hits I decided I was high enough and stopped. I looked around and everything felt like I was in a play? Like none of this was real in a sense? It felt like people were watching us on tv or me and my friend were acting out a play. It was really weird but really cool. I guess the whole “were all in a simulation” theory. Then “I Fall Apart” by Post Malone came on and I bust into tears thinking about my ex. Idk why I cried. I felt like a wimp so after I got done crying I laughed extremely hard at myself ahaha. I could not stop laughing. Then I eventually passed out and woke up the next morning. Interesting night for sure lmao",0

"Honestly? Weed keeps me going. I’m a minor, and i tried smoking for a month, and i really loved it. I decided to pretty much stop until im off to college, because the stress of getting caught outweighed how relaxed i was from the bud, and smoking while young isnt the best for your brain.

And the thought of being able to collect pieces, to collect lighters, to roll joints, to try different strains, to smoke with someone i love, to go outdoors while baked, its something that gives me hope. It’s less about being drug crazed, and more about i cant wait for the freedom and peace and joy to come with this medicine. Weed is just one aspect that keeps me hopeful for the future, as well as being able to have pets, have my own space, have my own privacy, and to be a little bit more free.

Thanks for listening buds",0

"Marijuana helps me master my disability. Alright. It’s summer, and I have been smoking pretty frequently since school ended. My school does drug tests, so I have three months out of every year to completely embellish myself in every drug known to man before I return and drug tests begin again in the fall.

My most significant observation is the incredible effect of weed on my ADD. 

For all that don’t know, ADD (also known as Attention Deficit Disorder) affects ones ability to pay attention to pretty much everything all the time, making memory is difficult to retain. I take medication for this disorder, and that helps me focus, but as soon as I hit my buddy’s dab pen, I drift out of reality. 

Upon entering the reefer’s paradise, my ADD symptoms triple in efficiency. I can’t pay attention to anything for more than 5 seconds. My memory sucks. I’m crazy lazy. I might as well be a vegetable. 

But I’ve found that while I indulge in my high, I have the ability to tune anything I want out of my attention. I have literally mastered the art of my disability in that if someone is lecturing me or talking to me that I dislike, I can simply turn their volume off manually.

I need to know if other people have this ability or if I am the only one to experience this superpower.",0

Curious about the long term negative effects of weed. What do y’all think? I am a lover of smoking weed as i’m sure all of you guys are. It truly seems like the perfect drug and honestly nothing else i’ve tried has come close for me. Lately my girlfriend has been on my case a bit about me smoking (although I do very moderately) and talking to me about the long term negative effects of smoking weed. This has caused me to do quite a bit of research on the topic and to my dismay every study seems to take a completely different stance and have completely different results. I suppose I just want to hear y’all’s take on this and hear any info you might know. It’s all appreciated :),0

"Am i bad at rolling joints or is this normal? Hi,

I am a casual smoker. I tend to not finish my joint in 1 time and I tend to leave it for the next time. I have noticed that when i try to finish the joint the next day for example it is very hard to smoke it and it is nasty. It is as if I was smoking for the first time or something.

I believe this should not be very rare problem for people like me and I was wondering if this is normal or am I doing something wrong?

"Please help! My awful experience with weed... A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his friend. It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience...

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Here’s what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of the friend’s room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and his friend was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and unzipping their pants—in a sadistic, mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and his friend never did the pants stuff. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to the other guy, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions and we didn’t speak at all after the incident.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and remember the fear so deeply, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. I’ve always felt very in control of my reality on drugs and never saw anything that wasn’t really happening. 

Is it possible that weed can make you hallucinate like this? Could they have given me a different drug? Other things that happened during this episode were that I saw lights flashing on and off and blinds opening and closing at a rapid pace...basically everything was sped up like in fast forward motion. It scared me so bad, I thought I was dying. 

Please help! I’ve had so much trouble sleeping since then. I still have recurring dreams about being raped and have even started to question whether I was raped or sexually abused during my childhood and that’s why I had that reaction to the drugs, like maybe a suppressed memory or something. Or maybe there’s nothing wrong with me and I’m totally normal but they tricked me and accused me of hallucinating and now I’m starting to believe them... :(",0

"Interesting weed high. *Note: Sorry for bad grammar because a lot of things lol. I am using a phone, I don't speak English as a first language, and lastly I am kida high rn off a dab. 

So my co-worker and I got some really potent bud and rolled it as a joint and smoked the whole thing. It got me really messed up. Usually I can only get this high from like a 50mg edible but I guess the strain we smoked was really really strong so it had me and my co-worker blasted. Anyway he gets a call from his wife to pick her up from her work because her car isn't working, and he goes inside to get her while I stay in the car and move to the backend of the van where all our ladders and tools are and I have to sit on the floor. All of a sudden I see out of the side window my co-worker sprint to the car, and frantically opening the doors in the backend of the van and looking all scared and stuff at me. I shit my pants I suspected the cops somehow had followed us and because they smelled our joint and were now coming at us. He looked me dead in the eye, very very scared look on his face, and he said, ""Hey can I have my juice I think I left it back here... Oh there it is... Bye!"" Then he ran back. Two minutes later and he and his wife get back in and it was normal. We drive to the bank and I try to go in but end up going to wrong way and his wife is now laughing at me and pointing in the other direction (she knew I was baked). I went into the bank and went in line and stood there for 5 minutes waiting. I got super paranoid and thought every was looking at me becuase I look super high (my eyes are all red and squinted) and I then just turn around and leave the bank without doing anything with my money. We then go to his house for a minute. Now I don't drive my car to work, my co-worker picks me up from my house because it's faster. Anyway his wife offers me a ride home and I agree. It is then that we both have a super introspective and deep conversation all the way home. We both knew how stoned I was so we had a fun conversation about life, the world, the universe, cars, humankind, family stuff. Yeah and then she dropped me off at my house. That was 2 days ago.

Im planning on exercising everyday for two weeks straight in preparation for the military and to clear my system. I heard it takes about more than a month for THC to leave your system if you’re a regular user. 

Any of you regular users cleared your system in under a month with just exercise and lots of water? Any other recommendations to speed up the process? I’m trying to enlist before the end of August.",0

"Question about pain and weed. So I have had chronic pain in my hand for a while now. I play guitar and my left hand can be a little bit tender sometimes. I went to physical therapy for a few months and it got better. During that time I was taking a long break from weed. Recently I smoked for the first time in about five months and all of a sudden my hand feels weird again. I googled it and found there is a link between weed and being more sensitive to pain. 

My question is this: what should I do? On the one hand playing guitar is something I’m really passionate about and I’m kind of hoping I can turn it into a career. On the other hand, I would like to occasionally enjoy a bowl without my hand hurting. I’m not a daily user, mainly on the weekends only. Any thoughts?",0

"Cannabis coconut oil---should I decarb before I put it in slow cooker?? Hi, 

I've been reading many recipes for making cannabis coconut oil and today I saw a recipe that don't require decarboxylation (for slow cooker method). 

&amp;#x200B;

 it says ""combine oil and cannabis in your slow cooker, and heat the two together on low or warm for a few hours. this allows for decarboxylation without scorching (which destroys the active ingredients)""-Leafy

&amp;#x200B;

I was always told to decarb first, so I don't know which one to trust. 

Does anyone NOT decarb first and just put them in in a slow cooker? that sounds so much easier",0

"Brownies made with ground up weed This happened a few months ago but I think about it every once in awhile because it's really never happened before in my 10+ years of smoking..

I was at someones house and they asked if I wanted a brownie their friend had made. They swore they were super strong high quality. I took one and ate a bit and it tasted awful. They said their partner got so ripped on one and we should power through. I started inspecting the brownie and realized whoever made it literally just took ground up weed and tossed it in brownie batter. 

Eventually I just put it down and smoked a bowl but my sesh partner swore they felt really stoned and kept saying them doing things was because of the brownie. I felt zero effects other than the bowl I smoked.

I texted them the next day joking about how gross it tasted and they got offended and said them and their partner got super high so maybe it ""wasnt for me"". 

So - are people just throwing weed in their food? If you did, would you get ""super ripped""? I was always under the impression this didnt work unless the THC had a binding agent like the fats in butter. 

I dont even hang out with this person anymore but it was just weird at the time..",0

"Has anyone else experienced something like this? So up until two months ago I was a daily smoker. I stopped for a month because I was going to get tested for this job. Anyway after passing my drug test I’ve cut down on smoking.  I’ll smoke like 2-3x a week now. I smoked on Monday and everything was normal. However, yesterday I smoked only HALF a blunt and had the worst experience ever. My heart started pounding extremely fast to the point I thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. I also started feeling extremely hot. I did feel high but I was just more freaked out than anything. I started pacing around my room just telling myself to relax and that I was just tweaking hard. I’ve never had a panic/anxiety attack in my life, but I’m started to think that what I experience just that.  Has anyone else experience something like this? 

Also just want to point out that I shop from the same dealer and never had any of these side effects before.",0

Now..

Due to medical reasons I explained the whole situation about weed to my gf and she said it was okay. Now I’m over here wanting to roll one up but idk how. Any suggestions? I’ve tried the vape pens (there okay) and edibles (I get wayyy too high.).",0

"My mom just ate my fucking edible. This is not a fucking drill!

So I was unpacking my thing in my room and I had my two weed cookies on top of my clothes in a Saran Wrap in my luggage so I had to take them out to get to my clothes. I put them on my bed and went to the bathroom. I’m such a fucking idiot. 

So she has this tendency to just eat people’s food is she sees it laying around which pisses off my dad and I. Like I didn’t think she would come in my room. I was freaking out when I heard her come in and was like “Gosh did you have to bring home your whole closet?”

I didn’t want to bring attention to the edibles since it was going to be suspicious so I just hoped she would notice it. 

Then I heard her say “Aww you brought me cookies?”

And I was like “No, sorry. They’re for me.” And she started getting offended for no reason and was like “You always have to be so selfish.” and blah blah blah lol.

I didn’t want to press it to much because I didn’t want her to think something was up with them and I was worried. 

Now I’m fucking screwed. Im just going to pretend like I don’t know what’s going on with her when it kicks in. I’ll say something like “Maybe you’re medication is acting up again.”. But I’m kind of scared because she literally never smoked or consumed weed except for that so-called time in college but I doubt she inhaled lol.

She’s going to freaking the fuck out. 

I’m just mad that she ate that shit and now I only have one left to enjoy... I had a dream this shit would happen.

I’ll update in like an hour.

I’m soooooo scared. She’s gonna be so fried. I only eat like a quarter and I smoke every day. Imagine her on a whole one and there was more than a gram in that cookie.... omfg. Fuck my life....

Update:

Okay so she’s literally normal. People keep asking what’s happening and... nothing is happening. I guess since she ate dinner it’s taking a while but I’m gonna say in the next 20 minutes she gonna feel it. I’ve been just casually peaking downstairs to check in on her. I do not want to be around when it hits tbh but I know I have to be since my dad is gonna be so confused lmao.

Meanwhile I’m smoking a roach in my bathroom lmaooo. 

**UPDATE**

Yooooo. She’s tweakinnnn.

I’m just laying in bed and I hear “Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Lawd have mercy! God help me!” 

Yoooo helppppo 

UPDATE

I’m laughing my fucking ass offffff I went downstairs and my dad is literally trying to hold her up bro. AHHHHHHH. Yo she’s gonee. She’s like “Me gettin heart palpations. Lawd help me.”” 😂😂😂😂 

Her eyes are red as shit oh my fuck

UPDATE

She’s find rn. She’s laying on the couch and quieted down. I think she’s going to just fall asleep. I gave her tea per her request and she not asking for food which is surprising. 

I’m playing Elvis music for her lmao and she’s loving it. 😂😂😂😂😂

UPDATE

She finally went up to her bed and let me help her up. Literally when her head hit that pillow she knocked the fuck out. 

We’re all going bed now. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring but yeah. Thanks for still around guys. I’ll update tomorrow (today).

And also thanks for all the likes. This shit blew up lmaoo. 

UPDATE (NEXT MORNING 7:16 am)

I woke up early cause I just do that shit and my dad is up I think but I haven’t heard my mom. She’s usually up at like 6. 

I’m guessing she’s still tired from it but I’m getting up to check on her. I feel like like my dad is gonna be pissed. Then again he doesn’t really know about weed edibles or anything.

A lot of fucking people are saying that I poisoned my mom. I did not poison my mom. You’re insane for saying that. These are EDIBLES not fucking arsenic. She ate them herself after I told her not to. READ THE POST. She was just high as hell but mellowed out after like an hour and a half. My family and I calmed her down and made her comfortable and she went to bed close to 1 am. 

I would never poison my mom. So people accusing me of that are ridiculous. My mom is fine and alive.

Lastly, I’m tired of people assuming my race and gender lmao. Maybe the majority of the people in this subreddit are white males but I’m a Black female. Okay? Lol. I’m her daughter. 

My parents are Jamaican but no they’re not one of those “One love. One heart. Let’s smoke together and feel alright.” type Jamaicans. So that’s why telling them about the edible is probably the worst thing to do. 

I’m not a terrible person. Accidents happen. I’m not the first person whose parent has eaten their edible. This is why you don’t eat people’s food after they tell you not to. Alright? Geez. (Now people are going to think I’m an asshole for saying that.)

UPDATE (7:50 AM)

My mom is finally awake and she looks GONE. Like her eyes are droopy. However she getting suspicious.

“I think who ever made those cookies needs to learn to bake.” Baaaahh

No, because you got baked af last night... I’ll stop. 

I don’t know how she still woke up early but I can tell she still feels it. She’s just confused and saying weird things. She’s also really uncoordinated and irritated. 

I’m debating if I should just tell her but I don’t want to give her a bad image of weed. The other day we were literally talking about the benefits of it and now she’s going to think it’s a terrible drug... know her she’ll think they were laced with some hard drug like coke or something. 

She’ll never forget this though...

UPDATE (9:13 AM)

BROOO MY FUCKING BROTHER. 

Okay so basically my brother started playing Broccoli by DRAM and my mom was like “Why you have to play something so vulgar.” and my brother was like “Mom, listen to the song. I think you can relate a little.” And she was still confused and I was trying to eye my brother like “Don’t tell her!”

Then he fucking says “You ate ate an edible.”

My mom: “What’s an edible?” 

My brother: “It’s like weed made into food and you ate a whole one last night.”

I hate this motherfucker brooooo.

She’s so pissed now. We had this whole ass argument while my brother thinks it’s funny.

This man stays getting me in trouble. Omfggggg. 

LAST UPDATE (11:56 AM)

So she’s sober now as far as I know. She’s still very pissed after finding out. I lied and said I threw the other one away (wondering why she didn’t ask for proof). 

Her exact words when my brother told her it was an edible we’re. “Ya better be lyin’, ya see! If that cookie had drugs it- Jesus, Lawd...”😩🍪

My brother: “It just had weed.”😆🍁

My mom: “People ah smoke weed an’ demma eat deh something too? Mm mm. No. What if me was dead? Eh? Suppose me have a heart attack?”😡🇯🇲

Me: “No one has died from weed.” 😂

My mom: “You look here, likkle girl 👧🏽. Me nah listen to any of ya foolishness. Ya bring that somethin in me house again and you gon see what’s in store fah you!!” 😡😡

Bruh. I had to write it exactly how she said it or else it isn’t as accurate nor funny. So she basically just yelled at me and threaten me. Lol. I honestly don’t give a fuck. 😈Probably gonna smoke in this house and bring weed cause ya girl needs her weed so. 🤷🏽‍♀️

By the end of the day, she’ll cool down and one day we’ll all laugh about this. Don’t leave your freaking edibles out kids! Some of you White people are lucky. Your mom would probably be like “You ought to not let this happen again, Christopher. You’re grounded for two days. This is a warning.”. Lol joking... don’t get offended lmao.

Alright, I’m done lol.

UPDATE (9:03 PM)

So I ate a quarter of the edible that was left and brooo. That shit kicked me in the ass in just 40 minutes. I’m so high.... I almost forgot to post this",0

"I decided to quit smoking I am a 21 year old recently graduated history teacher, and as far as I can remember from my college days, I have smoked a lot. It consumed much of my money and my humor, the taste, now that I come to think of it, is awful, and the smell just really bothers me in the nose.

Therefore, I have made a decision. Everytime I have money to buy cigarettes, I'll go out and buy some weed, because that'll finally get me to stop smoking these damn cigarettes.

"86 yr old grandmother finally said yes to edibles This is such a wholesome post but a bit long yet I'm so excited....
My husband's grandmother who is 86 yrs old (very religious  and law abiding but lives in an illegal state) has had bone spurs that have kept her in bed alot. She was on oxycodone for years at a high dose and went through full withdrawal when her insurance stopped covering. DESPERATE for relief. 
She finally said she wanted edibles and I live in a legal state so a family member came to visit and brought her back some, thinking it might not work.  WELL, she ate one and is walking around without her walker, eating sandwiches and laughing at the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" as I type this.
I am over the moon for her.",0

"Worst Weed (?) Experience I've Ever Witnessed In My Entire Life Ok, so before we start. I smoked the exact same weed as my brother, admittedly not as much and out of a different bong (the one he uses is huge and pretty dirty). My brother is 17 and super thin.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; This is difficult to shorten but essentially my brother takes a huge hit of weed and then thinks he's dying/ hearing voices. Parent's say its a panic attack but it doesn't make sense based on how the ""panic attack"" presented: HUGE wide open eyes, terrified and angry, switching between calm and scared, not being able to see/ seeing double, and saying he's hearing voices. He hasn't woken up yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

At like 9pm, I go into my brother's room and smoke a bowl. I leave and let him enjoy whatever weed was left in the grinder and bowl with his friend. I see at 11 pm he takes a HUGE hit that he posts on his snap story. Completely milky 2 foot bong rip. He's told me that his tolerance has been really high and that he needs like 3 bowls to get high so I think nothing of it.

&amp;#x200B;

At 11:30 I get a knock on my door and our parents call me into their room. My brother is FREAKING OUT. His eyes are WIDE OPEN. I'm telling you I've never seen someone's eyes open that wide-- especially if they were just smoking. He's telling them that he's dying and it seems like he is seeing double or can't see or something because he keeps reaching out to hold my hand/ grab my mom and he's missing. We kept asking if he was seeing anything but he said he didn't have any visual hallucinations. He claims he didn't take anything else and I believe him because he comes to me with anything drug related BEFORE he takes it and whenever there is a problem. Immediately I go into his room and asked his friend what happened-- if he took anything. His friend says that he didn't just took a huge bong rip, threw up, and then got 2 inches from his face and started screaming about how he was dying.

&amp;#x200B;

I search the room for drugs or anything weird. Everything's fine. I go back to my parent's room. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's standing on the bed, screaming that he's dying, and my parents are trying to make him sit. He says he hears voices and that he's seen the future????  He's not making any sense at all. He looks terrified, and then suddenly switches to angry and he's waving his arms everywhere. He switches back and forth between these two emotions for a bit. Then, he starts drifting off to sleep and waking up every now and then. Each time he wakes up, he gets scared again-- sits up really fast and starts screaming about how he's dying and goes back to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parent's say it was just the weed and a panic attack. But I've never seen someone react this way before and my brother smokes ALL THE TIME. I've seen him so high he can barely move or keep a conversation. I don't understand why he wouldn't be able to handle that. Plus if people green out, usually they don't move as much as he did/ aren't as amped up as he was. AND his tolerance was so high- he took one hit albeit a huge one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus-- if it was a panic attack, wouldn't it stop as soon as he was calm enough to go to sleep? If we was coming to and immediately sitting up/ freaking out/ getting scared again, that doesn't sound like a panic attack right? It's like he was scared of something he saw/ was with him. He would be calm and then look at me or random objects and literally flip out again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know...

&amp;#x200B;

He's still sleeping now- 12 hours later so I don't have his perspective of it yet/ I don't know how he will be feeling when he wakes up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious if anyone here has the same issue as me and if so which way do you find the best in regard to having little to no allergic reaction?

"First time I’ve been offered to do edibles today. It’s my first time and I have a lot of concerns for a few reasons:
1. My period has been going on for almost 3 weeks now (I’m not pregnant)
2. I’m doing a blood test and ultrasound next week (because of reason no.1) and I’m afraid they might find drugs in my system (don’t want parents to find out since I still live with them). Also I don’t know if I’m even allowed to take drugs before ultrasound. 
3. I suffer from light to moderate depression and I’m afraid it will worsen after the weed affection will go away
4. I’m generally afraid to try this out and very nervous even though I want to experience this.

"Do you ever cough up nasty shit? (Answer will not help if you are also a cig smoker or heavy vaper) The only thing I smoke nowadays is weed since I've finally been able to boot cigs and vaping out of my life.  

For the past week I've been coughing up some grey phlegm.  I've been smoking weed for 6 years and this has never been a problem until now (besides when I picked up nicotine, but that was because of the cigs/vape obviously.)

I think it's because the buds I have right now are not trimmed well (perhaps not trimmed at all.)  It's relatively good weed, but I think that I'm coughing this nasty shit because of the excessive leaves on the buds.

Anyone ever deal with this?  Or been able to confirm that it was because of shitty weed/smoking the leaves?

Maybe my body just needs a break, but I do not feel mentally prepared for that.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm quite dependent on cannabis.

"Weed coffee has me hallucinating (warning!) So I'm a bit hallucinatey right now off some weed coffee i made out of my abv. I went out to smoke a j since its 420 am and i started seeing shadows all around moving and i got paranoid as fuck and scared. I swear i saw an alien in the corner of my garden but i checked and I'm clearly hallucinating. I'm inside now so I'm fine it's more like I'm just anxious now i guess. Couple details i have to add:

1. I haven't slept all night because i drank too much diet soda near bed time.
2. The coffee was my first in three days so it hit me
3. I Smoked A cbd joint with Honolulu haze and cherry bud
4. The coffee was made with abv that included thc bud (tiny amount but it was On top so I'm sure it's in there) and mostly cbd hemp flower. Mostly the cherry strain.
5. I have mental illness (mmj patient)

Apparently the mix of coffee and high cbd made me double ""up"", or ""peaking"", as cbd has a caffeine effect and I'm tripping because of the massive load of endorphins. 

Attn: drug addicts; this shit has me feeling like meth and acid!!! So go for it if your trying to be high lol

Attn: people trying to be healthy and sane; don't mix coffee with hella cbd. Gives a psychosis feeling, possibly only to those with history of mental illness or currently mentally ill

I doubt there was any thc in it it probably turned into cbn because i microwaved it after Vaping it. I'm possibly feeling the radiation, who knows? Afterwards i realized i should not be so lazy and microwave the water alone and then add abv..but I'm gonna continue being lazy that's just for you folks being careful

Anyways at first i got a hella happy feeling and then a body high and then i felt stoned like normal I'm not really noticing the caffeine from the coffee but I'm chill af just gotta stay in light or my mind plays tricks on me. Feeling super happy tho lol. Like if your depressed or have major depression problems this might help but not if you have anxiety

Not really a question more of a psa. i know they make weed coffee but not this strong lol.

Weed newbie So i just started smoking about two months ago. Every time i smoke i have different “highs” even with the same weed. Some times i don’t feel much at all. Then sometimes it makes me feel pretty sick. I get very dizzy and feel like throwing up. Is this just because i smoked too much? Edibles don’t seem to do much except make me super spaced out and like time goes by in like a snapshot feeling. Other than that i don’t feel “high.” Only a few times have i had the really nice euphoric feeling. Iv tried smoking the actual flower and edibles but mainly i use a vape pen. Why does my experience vary so wildly even with the same weed?,0

"Improving yourself Since I’ve started smoking weed and getting older I realised that I reflect myself much more. It’s like thinking about your behaviour towards other people and your decisions that you’ve made. When I was a young kid in high school I’ve never abused anybody like physically or tried to ruin their life in any form, but I’ve made fun of them. I feel like i tried to be the class clown and make others laugh on the cost of others to seem funny and interesting to people. The moment I’ve read the definition of the word class clown was one of the most important moments of my life. Meanwhile I’m always trying to be the best person I can be and try to make the people feel good and confident as much as I can if I see them somewhere randomly. That’s not about fishing for apology at all, it’s just that I’m sure you can improve yourself and do good whenever you can and should. Love yall",0

"There is only one level of high... I've been smoking eleven years and I've literally never experienced ""more high"" ""extreme high"" or ""double triple antant high"" lmao and i have had some of the fattest sessions. Had 30-50 gram joint to the head once alone. Same high as one gram joint next day with the same weed

There is one level. There is half a level and less than that but you can't go past high...or get double the effect of maximum. So smoking past your point is a waste and clearly all gimmick. Like people taking one gram dabs and being like I'm on a scale of 1-10 a 13. I get it. It's funny. entertainment wooo! But some people are serious about that lol

I get tolerance but why push it? I once told a stoner girl that how much do you smoke til you feel it. She was like two hits everytime. i was like me too let's bone!! No i was like then why smoke more. She was like cuz i get higher.

I'm clearly stoned right now but i always smoke the same amount. This time i smoked double....same high....lasting just as long. I do it for the fun of smoking and the taste not to get an imaginary double high lol

I used to joke tho that each joint ascended me to a new level of high like I'm a super saiyan reaching super saiyan 2 or even 3. For those of you that don't get my dbz reference....screw you i ain't explaining hahaha

Anywho. I want to hear thoughts on this.

I've been toking regularly with heavy blunt use for about 7 years now. In January 2019 I was smoking like usual until things took an odd turn one day. My neck started feeling weird as if something bad was going to happen, it's definitely THC related because CBD doesn't do this to me. After that day I noticed when I smoke my neck has this really uncomfortable feeling to it as if something bad is going to happen my blood pressure and heart rate go up and I have to hold my arm behind it to stabilize it. I know weird right? I've tried so many supplements and other methods but nothing seems to make it go away when I smoke accept for time. It lasts about 20-45 minutes its kinda scary and in the moment feels like bad things will happen. It occurs after light usage not even heavy smoking. Im not sure if its because I have wayyy way to much THC circulating in my body or what. I just wanna smoke peacefully and comfortably like I used to. Has anyone else who has been smoking awhile or period felt adverse symptoms such as these please hit me up so we can solve this. My only best guess is detoxification and laying off doe a month. Or so. In the last 3 months I've probably only smoked half ounce if that usually I would smoke anywhere from an G to 14gs blunt after blunt kinda thing when I had it like that. Before it was just when I smoked blunts. Smoking Bowls/hitters I was just fine until these last 2 months recently.",0

"I quit Vaping I quit Vaping and went back to smoking because no matter what form of Vaping i was doing it made me gag and cough. I even have a volcano so it isn't my device. Tried e juice, nope. Distillate, nope. And several crappy versions that are worse than smoking like Mct oil carts. Once got coconut oil when they claimed it was wax cartridge. 

Anything i try only tastes good for a second then I'm coughing a lung. And that burnt popcorn or beans taste is awful. Abv edibles taste terrible too.

I think it's unhealthy in comparison to smoking especially e juice and distillate, not enough research to say it's healthier especially with Vaping flavors and terpenes which in my experience terpenes burn easy and i mean bad burn. And Vaping dry herb feels like water vapor instead of actual cannabinoids

Smoking gets it all into you and Vaping gets you some then you have abv....it's a shame i wanted it to work. i actually use more herb Vaping then smoking and i get less high Vaping

Anyone else feel this way? 

I'm tired of coughing and getting barely high. I smoke a joint and I'm good for at least 2-3 hours but when i vape I'm like itching for relief within half an hour. By my math i can smoke .5 in five minutes and vape it in an hour. So clearly Vaping is not efficient.

I know I'm not doing it wrong because I've tried several devices and methods over five years. I'm finally done trying lol. Smoking tastes and feels better plus is faster.",0

"Concentrate inside or outside a joint? Which do you prefer? So I'm stoned and I'm contemplating dank joints and how they are made.

I was wondering what people think is the best method to roll a joint with concentrate (kief, wax, shatter, etc), inside the joint or outside, and why?

To answer my own question i feel like it's a waste to put concentrate on the outside because your smoking what's inside the joint not outside. I mean like I've rolled em that way and i never feel i get the full effect like when it's rolled inside. Sure it looks pretty outside and you can make art out of it but it's only gonna burn off and not really get in you. I'm sure some will but it's not efficient. Maybe it's better for sharing or hot boxing because it gets everywhere lol unlike when it's inside it kinda would go into one person in one fat rip and everyone else wouldn't get any. I've experienced this with friends.

So i like it inside (that's what she said!) Cuz i usually smoke alone and don't hot box anymore.

"Developing discipline/moderation? I’ve never had moderation with drugs or alcohol or anything else. Now that I’ve been sober for 3 years I’m starting to wonder if I can actually do things in moderation if I just try.

One thing I realized from coffee is that I’ll quit for months or even years and one day decide to go back and automatically start drinking it every day even multiple times.

Yesterday I drank a latte after 4 months off. I told myself I would have a latte once every two weeks from now on, and if I can do that for a year and it gets easier, then after a year I will try drinking alcohol or smoking weed once every 2-3 weeks.

I kind of wanted coffee again today but didn’t, and this is probably my first time going back to something and not having it again the next day so it’s already a big thing for me. I’m realizing that if I just set the goal I can actually do it.

My hope is that since I have 3 years off of weed and alcohol, I will be less dependent on it if I go back. Like I’ll be able to take it or leave it.

Do you think I can compare coffee to alcohol and weed, or will they be much more powerful in that I won’t be able to go the next day without it?",0

"weed made me hate my date and myself      i met up with this guy who ive been secretly talking to for the last few months for the second time yesterday. we both had our first kiss together the first time we met up. i really do think i loved him. and its crazy because i talk about it like it all happened years ago and it didnt. yesterday we met up again a second time and got high and all of a sudden i just started hating him for no reason. i didnt want him near me, i didnt want his arm around me or him close to my face. 
      i ended up feeling so bad that i ended our little date thing early because we just were sorta sitting in a little opening in a forest in complete silence. honestly it was a really scary high. i was paranoid and upset that i couldnt figure our why i was feeling so apathetic towards him, and then i started thinking about how i dont love anything, that i just might not be able to be chained down by a person or a relationship, and that i was meant to be free and a loner that would just live to have lots of experiences and stories to tell. 
     i understand that might not seem like a bad thing but it completely goes against everything i thought i wanted, and its like this dark cloud looming over me telling me i should just be alone. ive tried talking to him about just these complex and weird emotions ive been having the last two days and he just doesnt really seem to care about how i feel, albeit, hes also been insanely high himself. he usually gets like this while high.
    the thing is, this high was really weird for me though, not like what i usually feel and i havent quite experienced anything like it before so its just making it really hard to understand how much of it was something i should worry about and how much i should just shrug off and blame the weed on. 
     i just felt so disappointed in myself. like i kept getting these flashbacks to distant memories from my childhood i thought id forgotten and i would think about everything i thought i would be when i was my age now and what i thought i was going to be like as a child is nothing like how ive turned out. i feel like an embarrassment and that i ruin everybody.",0

Well this past weekend I decided to upgrade bought a pulsar brand go series that can run wax or herb for $80 including a second backup coil. I swear I can't tell the difference between that pen and a regular rig besides no longer needing a loud ass blow torch. 10/10 would reccomend",0

"Indica causing newbie smokers paranoia?! I’ve been smoking for 3 years now, generally I prefer Indica or Indica heavy strains to sativas.

My friend who has only smoked a couple of times shared a joint of kosher kush with me and it caused him intense paranoia, he smoked amnesia haze previously and he said he really enjoyed it.

"CCELL on Eureka Cartridges ? Hey ily for reading 

Long story short I got a GDP cartridge from this guy (it isn’t legal where I’m at) and noticed it had a cute little Eureka logo on it that I didn’t see on the website and didn’t think too much about it. It hit hard so I didn’t question it at all. But after getting a few others (a total of five over time) I noticed each actual cartridge was different as 4/5 of them said CCELL on it. Not just that but a few of them had different text sizes so each CCELL looked different on each cartridge. They all get me blasted though which has me guessing. I would really appreciate some insight on this 😩 should I be concerned ? Is this normal? Each strain tastes exactly how it should (with maybe the exception of cherry pie)",0

The state police snuck up to my window and caught me in the process, so I did not have time to hide the evidence. I was then put in in handcuffs and taken to the station to get processed. I am due to appear in court in about 2 weeks. I was wondering if there's any way I can ask for conditional discharge without an attorney as I cannot afford one at the moment. This is my first offense and I have no criminal record. Should I plead not guilty and ask for a public defender? Should I just go by myself and stick it out? I have never been to court before so I do not know what to expect.

"Still feel weird 3 days after smoking Hey everyone! 
Decided to ask here before totally freaking out and going to the doctor. I smoked from a bong about 3 days ago and am still feeling numbness in my body and a general feeling of disconnection, floatiness and brain fog. I feel sort of ""out of it"" and not like myself. 

Some background info: I've only smoked a couple of times before. When I smoke after drinking I experience memory loss for the period after the weed kicks in. I also had a severe panic attack the first time I had edibles(there was way too much in them obviously) where I was tripping balls and thought I was dying(ended up calling 911). Now leading up to this moment, I've smoked like 3 times within a week. 2 of those times were a bad experience(though not as bad as the edibles experience) and I got close to having a full-blown panic attack when I smoked from the bong 3 days ago. 

My question is whether this is something I should see a doctor for or if I should wait longer for these symptoms to go away on their own?",0

"Worst high of my life so far. Iv been smoking some what regularly for a little over a year now . earlier today I smoked like I usually do, the usual amount. at first I was having fun I made myself a late breakfast and watched some youtube videos I was having a good time. At like the 45 min mark I was having a horrible time. my mind kept racing I couldn't concentrate on one thing. So as my mind kept thinking my thoughts really got out of control. I didn't feel like myself. I felt as if everything I had ever known even myself was complexity fabricated. Nothing seemed real in the slightest bit and I was having a hard time coming to terms with it.  That was the worst part of my experience this time I couldn't understand why life was real, or who I was, nothing in the world we lived in made sense. I thought maybe I was too high and watched a video and everything the lady said in the video made it worse. So its a little while later and I decide to go my room so I could sleep it off. I just wanted it to be over. But then I couldn't get comfortable what so ever. eventually I did after I freaked out some more. I turned on some music and fell asleep. when found some songs that didn't provoke my mind to think about any and everything.

"Anyone ever heard of “The Detroit Cannosseurs” cartridge brand? Fake? I picked one up from a friend. Looks like a legit box. But I looked up their IG page and it’s private with only 38 followers. Can’t find any info online anywhere.  The liquid is kinda thin, but not as bad as other fake ones I’ve seen. But also not as thick as usual. It’s in a Tcore cart, which are refillable empty carts from China. But maybe a company can use them? How can I tell if it’s fake or not? He says he got it from the dispensary but I wouldn’t be surprised if he was lying",0

In the past couple of weeks, however I've found I've been paranoid to the point I've believed that I've been followed by multiple people and that they're all connected and following me. 

I know this is obviously stupid and the logic in my brain tries to overrule it but it just doesn't happen. Even when I'm alone I'll sit and worry myself into a stupid hole.

I'll wait it out and an hour or so later the CBD kicks in and I'm all good, chillin n everything. I'm just wondering if anyone has an understanding of what I'm dealing with, whether it's my own problem that is amplified by smoking or whether I should cut weed out for a bit or even if when I'm smoking I should smoke more so that I'm hit with more CBD initially which will mellow me out to start? 

As you can see I'm quite unsure so any help would be appreciated, hopefully if anyone else is struggling with this and just wants to chill they'll be able to help themselves too!

"Can make thc stored in your body fat make you high? I'm not a native English speaker, so some sentences might not be completely correct. 
I was recently at some kind of festival and I had a couple beers and a bit of nicotine afterwards I was dancing for about 2h straight. After I went home I felt a bit high after  feeling sober for like 1h after the nicotine and alcohol. I once read that you can fail a thc test after doing sports even though you smoked weed months before because some thc might be stored in your body fats. I accidentally drank the part with the most butter from a thc tea so I probably hat thc from like 7g of weed therefore I got really fried and I ate a lot.
 My theory is, that I had a lot of thc in my fat and I lost it while dancing to get high afterwards. It might be placebo but it really felt like being high.",0

"Smoking weed ruined my life I live in a country in which weed isn’t legal so you have to get it from dealers without rly knowing what substances are actually  inside the pot you’re buying. I never bought weed but I used to smoke my friends’ and every time everything played out as I expected it to: I got high, it felt amazing and a few hours later I was back to being my usual  self. 

Well that I was until I smoked with these friends that I’m not very close with for the first time, it was this shitty-looking hash that I’m almost certain was laced with some crap cos I had a massive panic attack while on it, had an awful headache accompanied by nausea and terrible brain fog and the worst part was that I smoked it about three weeks ago and I feel like I never properly came down from that high. I’ve become retarded since then, I can’t make logical connections, I lose any train of thought I start and I find it hard to express myself verbally. The friends I chilled with are known as my school’s stoners and I thought they were all fried because of the huge amount of thc they put inside their bodies everyday but now I understand that the thc’s not the one to blame given that the weed they usually have is defs laced. 

I smoked it during my summer break before 12th grade, which hasnt ended yet, and I know for a fact that my grades will drop from As to Ds next year, I ruined my dreams of studying abroad and becoming a doctor. My life’s over, I’ve been feeling suicidal cos of this.",0

"i need somes advices guys please so, basically i'm a french-guy and i used to smoke weed with somes friends back in high-school

Now i'm grown-up, and most of my friends went-away

I got a job, i work everydays, it's a pretty physical one too

And i got pretty-shitty superiors who do nothing all-day long,

But still manage to throw shit at me for coming 10-minutes lates one-day in the span of 9 months

It's tiring, and my life as been stressful for some-times now

So i just want to blow some steam-off at the end of the week basically

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been thinking of smoking weed again

The thing is:

\-i absolutely hate tobacco

\-and my friends went-away and we stopped talking since years because we all had to do our lifes separated

&amp;#x200B;

I still take somes news from them, because i want to keep contact and know if they're having a good-life

It would be extremely awkward and insincere from me to just straight-up ask them to put me in contact with somes dealers near my location

&amp;#x200B;

So basically

I've been thinking about growing weed

It's illegal to smoke, or grow-it here, but it's not illegal to buy seeds

Don't ask-me why, it's stupid, that's all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty alright at gardening flowers, fruits, and vegetables

So i think it wouldn't be too hard for me

But i have no ideas what kind of seeds i should-buy, or how to make-it grow

When the plant will be grown-up, how do i ""extract""-it?

And how should i consume it, i don't really want to go back to smoke with cigs, i hate-it

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be alright to just buy the ""finished-product"" from someone

But since it's reddit, i guess most of you guys are not in France, which would make it impossible

And it would probably be illegal and i wouldn't want to put anyone in troubles for this",0

"Eye twitch ? Hi guys,

So i'm vaping concentrate (only 3 puffs at night before going to sleep) and I usually get the rose gold from Bloom farms. Now about a month ago my dispensary advised me to try Unwind from Ace extracts and after smoking it I developped a left eye twitch.

What I notice is if I don't smoke for like 2 days, the eye twitch goes away and if I smoke, sure enough the next morning it comes back.

Do you think it's something in the Ace extracts product that might trigger this or is it weed in general? I've been smoking weed for years and never had this before but maybe I'm getting older and that's what weed does to me now.

I'll definitely get back to rose gold after I finish to use the Unwind but was wondering if any of you had experience with this issue.

"My heart almost stopped after smoking weed. Recently around a month ago I was hospitalized for smoking weed, i smoked out of a vaporizer which I found out later had to do with it. This particular vape hit really hard and always had you high to the point where you’d be so lazy that you wish you could move but you couldn’t.
 After I’m done, maybe around 20 minutes, my heart starts beating so fast that my chest starts feeling hot to the touch and I start getting the symptoms of a heart attack, I am young and my heart has always been healthy and stable. My jaw started to feel weird and my whole left side went limp and it felt like my bicep was being pulled apart from end to end. It was so intense that I thought I could be having a Charlie horse. 
It had got so intense that I had to go to the hospital and I’m not like any of those people who gets so high that they go to the hospital because there scared, no there was actually something wrong.
But it was only till after the hospital visit I learned that my heart could of actually stopped. I have an app on my phone called heart rate free and it’s 100% accurate (I tested it at the hospital with the machine next to me) and before I even thought about going to the hospital it read 175 bmp which was very dangerous for me to have been laying down doing nothing. It had been going for hours and  I was scared I had a blood clot or something was wrong with my heart. But it was just doing its job because when I got to the hospital and they ran blood tests I found out the large amounts of thc in my system were making me dehydrated and thickening up my blood making my heart work way harder than it needed to. If I would’ve stayed at home I could’ve had a heart attack and died cause that was was slowly happening. My heart needed to beat faster to get more blood to my organs but I found out the faster it went the more blood and hydration it would need but since I was dried up it was basically doing everything it could to stay alive. The hospital realized this and quickly put fluids in me and re-hydrated me which is when my heart rate of 190 went down to 100 which is how they double checked from the blood tests that it was the problem because my heart stated to calm down after it. They told me to be careful and sent me home where it went down even more from that. 

What I’m saying is that nobody can die from weed but you can die from dehydration. And  It still scares me to this day knowing that I could’ve died from it. I haven’t smoked weed since and I’m not planning too because hours of constant beating at high Bpm’s can really affect your hearts health and I’m worried if it happens again I won’t be able to live to tell the story again. Be safe when smoking large amounts and especially if your hot boxing bring as much water as you can. Believe it or not it could save your life.

My intention was to put some hybrid / sativa based oil Double Delicious (Seattle supplier)  into my own cookies and such. I've recently moved to the UK and bought a vape pen and put some of the oil in the pen. However I think that the guy at the pot shop told me the wrong info because on the back of the packaging it says that there is coconut oil in this item and says for external use only. So I think the shit I bought is a topical oil.

- did I just fuck up my vape pen by putting a topical oil in it?

- are there negative health affects by vaping a topical oil?

- Does anyone know anything about the brand Double Delicious from Tacoma Seattle? Do you think I was sold a topical oil or something else?

"Coming out of a grow box. Hi fellow potheads.

I have been smoking for something close to 10 years now. I tried to quit but, even after almost 4 months of absolute abstinence I did not see any benefits. 

I mean the short term memory improved , but I was so tense and sleepless and pissed off that the total effect was negative.

Looks like i am one of those who need to smoke to function. 

Well I want to come out with it and stop hiding and just smoke whenever I want.

But the problem is that weed is considered illegal in my country. 

I mean I can make it legal just for me as a medicine, but still being a pothead is frown upon. 

Any advices ? 

Should I even come out with that? And if not, do any of you have pro tips regarding smoking at work.

"The Boundy Buds So this is a story about some friends of mine, about a ""strain"" that we smoked for awhile that was wack. So a guy named Boundy grows weed, the weed is called boundy bud and from my short experience is full skitz, now I've done my fair share of psychedelics so weed now is still just a one way ticket to a trip, I was there for one of these events and heard about the other last night, first event was with a mate who we will call Tom asked me to pack him a phat cone and I did, he was already pretty stoned and we had a new massive party sized cone piece, so he punched the cone pulled it through was fine, maybe an hour passes and he asks for another this is where shit hits the fan a bit, I packed it to the rim was a bit bigger than the last one but i thought he would be fine but yeah nah, punches it pull it through looks like hes gonna green, i was thinking she'll be right, he was on the ground at this point and gets up stumbling around and blacks out falling smashing his head into a wood been a cutting his face up pretty bad then well having a seizure for no longer than 5 seconds, full fucked, he was alright after just really out of it but we took care of him and having his girlfriend there helping him out all night, he was fine  and still smokes weed.
So I asked him about it and he said it had happened before on the same strain maybe two weeks prior, got me thinking that it wasn't him hitting his head that caused it and more evidence has come to light, so this other mate we will call Ted had apparently been punching cones all night asked for one more and had blacked out and had a seizure as well for again no longer than 5 seconds.
Sharing this to get any more ideas on why it might have happened.",0

About to break a 5 day t-break. Aren’t you supposed to have crazy dreams? I’ve been a relatively heavy smoker for around two years now and this was my first ever tolerance break. It was actually not as difficult as I thought it would be. The only “symptom” I experienced were a slight high temper. I am disappointed though that I did not have any hyper realistic dreams. In fact that was one of the only things that kept me going through the break. Regardless I do not even remember a single dream I had. While I do feel slightly disappointed I am beyond excited to get stoned out of my brain tonight. I hope I get super high.,0
"Will a 2g blunt get 2 people zooted I'm picking up 3 grams tommorrow and a blunt wrap, and the night after that I'm meeting up with one of my good friends and we are going to roll about 2g into a blunt and save the extra g for use outside of the blunt. But I'm wondering will this 2g blunt get us both fucking baked (like fried) if we pretty much evenly split it, (I havent smoked for about a week for a tolerance break and I've always used bongs and bowls and this will be my first blunt, my friend has only smoked once off a dab cart, and got a little high but almost unnoticeable) of course though honestly I'm probably going to be smoking like 60% and he'll prolly be smoking about 40% since I'm more accustomed to it. Lmk what you guys think because I'm not very sure.

TLDR
will a 2g blunt alone get two low tolerance people totally fried or just normal high?",0

"Mom found my weed and I need help. I had some pretty good smelling weed in my room which was covered with a lot of bags, I thought nobody could smell it because I couldn’t at all but somehow she could smell it. Maybe I was just that used to it. It’s wasn’t much maybe a gram I was going to smoke it tomorrow but not then. I’m only 15, which I know I shouldn’t smoke weed at this age or whatever. But I’m still going to do it. I can’t really go out and do stuff with friends now because she doesn’t trust me and stuff. This isn’t the first time she’s caught me (found it before in my room like 6 months ago.) but this time she seemed really really really disappointed and me her don’t have a very good relationship anyways so. She said if I was caught with it by cops I would be in trouble and will not be able to go to college or get a job. She said you don’t know what weed does to your body because she is Uninformed (I guess that’s how you spell it lmao.) Also another reason is my dad was caught with it many many years back and got probation for it and he was involved in a wreck that killed his best friend because the roads were slippery and he has weed IN HIS SYSTEM. He had smoked a week prior to that. They tried to charge him with manslaughter with that. I live in Alabama so that’s why. She’s really disappointed in me and thinks that I’m going to become a bad kid or whatever. And she also thinks I’m going to need more and more weed to the point I need too much and I guess move over to other things? Been smoking for a year and only drank, smoke and took a xan or two. I’m not addicted to weed or feel the need to have it every day. I smoke in and off. I’ll smoke 3 days a week maybe. I just need advice and help please.",0

"Weird trip I was hitting some new shit with a friend of mine, had 2 J's I think. I didn't think they were hitting so I was taking some massive drags. Little did I know, apparently it was hitting fine. Cause before we finished passing the second one around, I was so fucked, I was sitting there just watching the trees in the background form into one color. I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. I remember asking them if I fell asleep I must've sounded like a fucking psycho cause it was like 15 seconds after I handed them a J. It felt like an hour or two for me. After that I just kinda sat there while they smoked the rest. Through the next 20 mins or so. My vision was fucked like it is when you get a blood rush. I was almost nauseous and got really dizzy when I stood up. I remember two images that would morph back from each other the whole time when I closed my eyes. One was a family portrait that hung in the living room of my house. And the other was the old red black and white buffalo sabres logo. To this day I have no idea what happened. I just assume it had something to do with the dope and my body cause they smoked the same thing and we're fine. Have you guys ever had something similar happen or know what that could've been.",0

The other night (Friday) I went to a party. I was drinking whisky at first and then I was offered some weed, so I was like hell yh and smoked the shit out of it. About 10 minutes later I started feeling really trippy. I started to feel like nothing was real like I wasn't real. Then I went and sat down for a bit and after I got up when I walked it was like I was teleporting about. I continued to drink and then I started to hear that people weren't actually saying. Well, I'm not sure if they were actually saying these things but I think it was something I hallucinated. I asked my older brother what it was and he said it was something called sycosis. I looked into what that sycosis is and it sounded like what I experienced but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After that night it has felt like I am still slightly detached from my mind and body and every so often I will feel like nothing is real. I have started to smoke a lot more than I'm used to if that helps.

Half a bong rip of a “Night-Time” Indica broke me out into a sweat and a panic attack where I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding. I put on my apple watch and my bpm was up to 180. It declined slowly over the next few hours. 

I would like to smoke very badly, however I am terrified of experiencing something like that again. What can I do to stop this?",0

"What's Your Top 3 Favorite Strains At The Moment And Why? Love this community of beautiful weed smokers, Ha-Ha.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my three favorite strains at the moment, this list will be updated in a month or two as I try multiple new strains. 420 everyday my brothers and sisters. Post your favorite 3 down below and tell me why; lets share, why not. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Sativa) Laughing Buddha: makes you more giggly and personally makes me more talkative and focused, and a massive cerebral wave radiates from my body. Overall a great daytime strain, pure happiness and upbeat for hours. 

(Hybrid) Cookie Breath: This strain is a ""couch lock"" if you smoke a lot. It makes your body melt into whatever you're sitting or laying on; can be used for nighttime or daytime use. A blissful mood washes over your entire body - euphoric. 

(Indica) Casper OG: My favorite stain for sleeping at the moment, personally. It calms the mind and almost feels like it forces you to lay down, your mind is very, very calm. You hit the bed numb, euphoric and not wanting to move. You fall into a deep, relaxing sleep.",0

"Weed withdrawal? Hello guys I’m a 16 year old turning 17 in about a month, I have been using THC daily since around late last year and have recently quit due to some personal reasons. The exact date that I Quit was around June 26th. It is now July 7th and I have been experiencing Withdrawal symptoms such as paranoia, anxiety, nausea and appetite loss. I have noticed that I still sort of feel head high such as depersonalization as if I’m not there and light headed, making things seem surreal. This in turn is making me depressed that maybe it might be permanent. Is there anything to worry about or will it pass in time? I was mainly only using THC oils in the form of cartridges.

"Anyone else get really bad cotton (dry) mouth? I never had this bad of an issue before. It would simply go away with water but now my cotton  mouth is soooo bad It’s like uncomfortably dry. It really makes me not want to smoke with people because of how bad my dry mouth gets. 

No matter what I smoke out of I get it, I have also tried different strains and still my dry mouth is embarrassingly bad. 

I have tried ; drinking water, chewing sugarless gum, soda, popsicles, mints. These all have helped but only temporarily I have to constantly drink water so much that it makes me pee a lot lol. Dry mouth comes back no matter what. 

Also - Ice (worked !! but makes my mouth extremely cold lol ) so unpractical. 

I don’t know if this also has anything to do with it but I’m also taking allergy medicine and Xanax from my dr so I think they both have a mouth drying effect.

"Weed teaches me. Im 17, I haven’t smoked pot very much, and I don’t smoke often at all, but then again, I’m probably too young to be smoking pot in the first place. I’d like to think of myself as pretty mature for my age, and while my friends are off their faces laughing and having fun, it seems that weed makes me hallucinate mildly. I have not done any drugs other than weed, but I get mild visuals both open and close eyed, more often than not while my eyes are opened. Every time it feels like those visuals try to teach me something or deliver me a message, most the time it is when music is playing. On the come up I almost always get a roller coaster visual that makes me believe that what the plant is trying to tell me is that I’m still at the beginning of the road but that I’m about to blast off because I do struggle with my sense of confidence a lot. I’ve also been shown myself on a stage a few times which it makes me feel better overall because I am an artist and it feels like it is telling me “you’ll make it, your hard work WILL pay off, just keep working”.  The high also lasts me much longer than my friends, feeling after effects for quite a while after smoking, up to days at a time, so I always smoke when I know I have nothing important to do for at least the next whole day. (Went to work once and it was wild, felt like I was high my whole shift”.  Don’t get me wrong I get a LOT of enjoyment and recreation off weed, and I know my shit isn’t laced (none of my friends hallucinate either) but it feels like weed often interrupts the “fun” in a good way, to teach me something or send me a message. Yeah that’s all I have I just thought I’d share it with all y’all! Peace. ❤️

"Weed &amp; Neurological disorders So for a little background, I am 19 and I have several neurological conditions, listed below

Tourette Syndrome

OCD

ADHD

Anxiety

Aspergers/Mild Autism-unofficial diagnosis, I have been told by several neurologists and therapists that I have it, but going thru the diagnosis process isn’t worth it since I don’t take medicine for anything.

So I have used marijuana for 8-10 months at this point, I never really smoke more than once or twice every 3 months. I have not taken any prescription medication for my neurological conditions in 6+ years, but I have noticed marijuana does have a profound effect on my conditions. 

After smoking, I have less noticeable tics from my TS, even tho my TS is already very mild. I also have an easier time dismissing obsessive thoughts and have less anxiety, I have yet to study my ADHD while high; however, I noticed I have higher social function when I am high. 
Those effects aside, I have also noticed some after effects when I loose the high…

For a period of 1-2 months after smoking I notice I can focus better, have less anxiety, and less issues with mood and my disorders. After some research, I believe this to be attributed to weed’s affects on serotonin levels. CBD acts like serotonin and THC has been reported to negatively effect the ability of serotonin reuptake. I believe this makes weed act like an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), resulting in increased free serotonin levels in my body for a period of time after smoking weed.

Please tell me your thoughts on the subject and post any questions you have for me. I’m just as curious as you may be about this!",0

"Creativity &gt; Disassociation Hi there! 1st posting here. 
I was wondering if anyone knows if there's any strains that won't induce so much depersonalization/derealization. I have mental illnesses, but smoking sometimes helps me to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. Helps me to write my mind out, too, which is great. But sometimes I get badly disassociated and it friggin sucks cuz I suffer from this, anyway. 
How can I take advantage of the good benefits and not feel awful at the same time? D:
I know this is a long shot, but I would love some advice.

"Ever since I ate an edible I’ve been feeling depressed. I know I have posted this question before I do apologize but I feel like I want more answers :( First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I’m saying, feeling like I’m not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I’m talking and it’s frustrating. I’m not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I’ve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it’s making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( I feel hopeless",0

"How do I get through an overdose? Hey everyone, first time user here. Yesterday I ate way more weed than I should’ve. Since I’m new at this, I still don’t know how to calculate how much is enough, and I ended up eating this edible without thinking. 

Next thing you know, I was in bed feeling like I’m going absolutely crazy. I had to call my friends, and I even think I had a psychotic episode. The worst part is... I feel like I’m still high and it’s been about 10 hours since I ate the edible. I still feel my heartbeat going way too fast. The hallucinations are gone, and I can form coherent sentences, but I still feel like I’m high.

For myself, i've been in the ballpark of about 3 times a day and a 4th every week for a pretty long time, but i'd be curious to see how other people's tolerances, preferences, circumstances, or just general inclination would differ from mine, especially with something as specific and varied as cannabis.

Side note, if you like i'd also be curious to know how much you think is best for someone who is a regular cannabis user, or how much you'd like to consume compared how much you do currently.",0

"Does weed make you lose weight? Some of my family members and family friends look very skinny, not anorexic, but skinny enough for others to notice and be concerned about. My cousins (family friends) look very pale, skinny, face sunken in a little. They smoke like fucking trains. Recently one of them had a baby and thankfully gained weight back so she looks a lot better now. Unless they're doing other drugs like popping pills along with smoking. 

I'd like to start smoking for my anxiety and honesty for fun as well. I obviously don't want to smoke every single day, just every once in a while. I have to approach this to my parents (I'm 18, still living a home obviously. Why wouldn't I get their permission?). My mom used to smoke when she was teenager, this back in the late 80s, early-mid 90s. So I'm pretty sure that the 1990 weed and 2019 weed are completely different now. More chemicals, I guess. Maybe they put chemicals in the plants to speed up the growing process and that's what makes people skinny?

"Fuck my life So after some time saving money i finally ordered my oil pen 2 days ago(thursday july 4).I did my research and ordered it from a well known supplier here in my country. In the courrier's app it said it will arrive on monday (july 8). The pen ended up  arriving today saturday (july 6). To my surprise,my mom wakes me up saying that a package has arrived for me. ""OH SHIT""was all i could think about  and she obviously saw it on my face.The doorman had called to notify about the package and she  had  recieved it...I planned on giving him(doorman) the heads-up to not give the package to ANYONE BUT ME and give him the shipping money , eventually...Since i still (in theory) had a few days left before it arrived.Long story short I told my mom the package that had arrived was a ps4 game as i went towards my bedroom.She came right behind me and asked me to open it and show it to her.So i did... I already knew i was fucked anyways...   
I Opened it and only showed the battery.She looked at the opened package and saw the cartidge's packaging that fucking says THC CANNABIS OIL all over it.

Fuck man... she was so fucking sad and pissed.
She returned to my room a few minutes later crying saying that this was too much for her and that she's worried about me.She asked me the whole worried-mom questions like ""You were smoking all these time,why do you do this? I cant trust you"" (she absolutely hates all drugs and never had to deal with any of these things in my family).It broke her heart.And in return it broke mine too.I've been a stoner for a few years now and i've always have been very obsessed about my family not catching me. My mom catched me like a year ago and i told her it was a one time thing.She gave me the benefit of the doubt i guess and gave me another chance.I fucking blew it in such a stupid way.What the fuck do i do now? I would like to quit weed but right now it is so implemented in my life and im so used to it. Im questioning everything right now.

"guys i’m not smoking weed anymore: i’m from the uk 15, a very very heavy stoner 😅
i started smoking at 13 with my brother, and it was fun, nights out in the back garden, but i stoped for a year. 
but recently i’ve been dealing with bad mental health issues, and i thaught weed might be able to help, as when i smoked for a few months when i was 13 it was pretty much the best time of my life, and i started smoking again, i got my friend into it and we both smoked everyday before school for weeks, it was great, but the last time i smoked with him was a week or so ago, and he had a seizure in mcdonals, but it was because he hadn’t ate the doctors said, so he stopped for a week, then on last monday we smoked a small polly joint before school and we was fine. but it’s currently saturday and i had a big haze and polly joint, and we was fine, but towards the end of the joint he started saying he was way too high, he seemed fine, but we got up and he was like i need to sit down, i looked over, he looked pale as a ghost, i start freaking out, then he’s he lays down, and stops talking to me, we are in a all way covered by bins so no one sees us, i whent to the shop like 15 mins ago for food as he had a seizure last time over not eating, and come back to him haven thrown up, i gave him the food but he hasnt ate, he’s had a swig of juice, and threw up again, so now we are both currently sat here. him laying in his puke. and me on my phone with nothing to do as he won’t speak to me or move, he’s fine, he’s not dead lol, because i keep saying ‘you ok’ and he says yeah so i know he’s alive. what the fuck do i do",0

"weed and introspection. an empiric study. I am a fairly extroverted guy and I love that about myself. I'm also as stupid as a beach towel and I hate that about myself. When I am sober I don t notice the stupid things I do and I ve lived in this state of just mindlessly enjoying life for about 6 months, since I ve stopped smoking weed. I stopped because it used to make me extremely introspective, to the point of simply not talking to anybody while high because I kept thinking about my own issues amd solutions for them. Last night I smoked, however and the usual happened: I started noticing all the social and personal mistakes I make and seeing how I could fix them. While I loved having access to this perspective after some time, when I woke up I felt absolutely miserable and my confidence hit rock bottom. Does anyone experience something similar? and if so, how do you balance it so that you reap all the benefits of weed induced introspection while keeping a positive outlook? cheers",0

I do think about stopping from time to time but never thought about quitting pot forever* Probably my lungs are gonna give up before i die from natural causes lol.

How long do you think it will take me to pass an urine test if I quit today, after four weeks? Thanks in advance!",0
"Ever been so high? My friend, after a few fat bong rips thought that he was abstracting himself from reality even more, to the point that he will die.

Well because for him it felt like he was shitting and pissing himself all the time while lying on the ground. He spent the next 30 minutes on the toilet.

"One time I got so high I couldn’t understand English anymore (sadly this is not a joke lol) So a while back, I went on a 3 month tolerance break, and upon coming back, I decided to take a fat. ass. bonger. This bonger fucked my shit, no joke, let me explain to you how this bonger made me unable to understand what people were saying. Something you should no first, is that my memory is notoriously bad when I’m high, but this time was different, my memory would only last for a couple of seconds at a time, it was so bad, I would forget entire sentences while they were being spoken to me. For example, one of my friends asked me “did you have a test yesterday” and I was just like “uuuuhhhh... what did you just say?” And they’d be like “did you have a test?” And I’d be like “when?” And they’d say “yesterday!” And then I would say “what happened yesterday?”. It was bad, I knew the words coming out of their mouths, but I couldn’t remember them long enough to form an actual sentence in my mind, so it just sounded like a bunch of words that had nothing to do with each other. At one point, someone would be talking to me, and then I would get hung up on something they said and then just think about it for like 15 seconds while they continued to talk, then when I was done thinking I would just walk away because I forgot that they were talking to me, then they’d come up and be like “wtf?” And I’d say “what?” and then he would say “I was talking to you” and I would just be like “really? When?”. Basically, for an hour and a half, I was trapped inside my mind and my shitty memory, my memory got so bad, that at one point, I thought I was stuck in a loop, because I would be listening to my friend talking to someone, then walk away, come back 2 mins later and that person is still talking to someone, I’d sit down and start listening, then I’d think “woah, I was just here listening to this exact convo” (which it wasn’t), I would then get up, walk away and come back to do it over again. And I have never been so zooked in my entire life since then, probably never will be.",0
"My first REAL experience As the title says, this would be the story of the first real time I’ve actually smoked weed. Before you ask, I’ve taken 1-2 hits off a bong or off a joint before this. Not enough to get me high or to actually really feel anything. Pretty much blue balls for getting high. 
.
.
Anyway, me and my friend were in his living room just relaxing. Asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said sure it why not. He rolled us up a blunt and went to town. After about 7-8 hits I really started to feel it. Now I’m no expert on weed or anything so I don’t know what kind of weed we were smoking. After I started to feel the high coming on, he kept talking to me and asking me questions but I couldn’t speak lol. I wanted to talk to him but I couldn’t physically bring myself to say anything at all. Like there was tape over my mouth or something. After a few more hits I decided I was high enough and stopped. I looked around and everything felt like I was in a play? Like none of this was real in a sense? It felt like people were watching us on tv or me and my friend were acting out a play. It was really weird but really cool. I guess the whole “were all in a simulation” theory. Then “I Fall Apart” by Post Malone came on and I bust into tears thinking about my ex. Idk why I cried. I felt like a wimp so after I got done crying I laughed extremely hard at myself ahaha. I could not stop laughing. Then I eventually passed out and woke up the next morning. Interesting night for sure lmao",0

"My mom just ate my fucking edible. This is not a fucking drill!

So I was unpacking my thing in my room and I had my two weed cookies on top of my clothes in a Saran Wrap in my luggage so I had to take them out to get to my clothes. I put them on my bed and went to the bathroom. I’m such a fucking idiot. 

So she has this tendency to just eat people’s food is she sees it laying around which pisses off my dad and I. Like I didn’t think she would come in my room. I was freaking out when I heard her come in and was like “Gosh did you have to bring home your whole closet?”

I didn’t want to bring attention to the edibles since it was going to be suspicious so I just hoped she would notice it. 

Then I heard her say “Aww you brought me cookies?”

And I was like “No, sorry. They’re for me.” And she started getting offended for no reason and was like “You always have to be so selfish.” and blah blah blah lol.

I didn’t want to press it to much because I didn’t want her to think something was up with them and I was worried. 

Now I’m fucking screwed. Im just going to pretend like I don’t know what’s going on with her when it kicks in. I’ll say something like “Maybe you’re medication is acting up again.”. But I’m kind of scared because she literally never smoked or consumed weed except for that so-called time in college but I doubt she inhaled lol.

She’s going to freaking the fuck out. 

I’m just mad that she ate that shit and now I only have one left to enjoy... I had a dream this shit would happen.

I’ll update in like an hour.

I’m soooooo scared. She’s gonna be so fried. I only eat like a quarter and I smoke every day. Imagine her on a whole one and there was more than a gram in that cookie.... omfg. Fuck my life....

Update:

Okay so she’s literally normal. People keep asking what’s happening and... nothing is happening. I guess since she ate dinner it’s taking a while but I’m gonna say in the next 20 minutes she gonna feel it. I’ve been just casually peaking downstairs to check in on her. I do not want to be around when it hits tbh but I know I have to be since my dad is gonna be so confused lmao.

Meanwhile I’m smoking a roach in my bathroom lmaooo. 

**UPDATE**

Yooooo. She’s tweakinnnn.

I’m just laying in bed and I hear “Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Lawd have mercy! God help me!” 

Yoooo helppppo 

UPDATE

I’m laughing my fucking ass offffff I went downstairs and my dad is literally trying to hold her up bro. AHHHHHHH. Yo she’s gonee. She’s like “Me gettin heart palpations. Lawd help me.”” 😂😂😂😂 

Her eyes are red as shit oh my fuck

UPDATE

She’s find rn. She’s laying on the couch and quieted down. I think she’s going to just fall asleep. I gave her tea per her request and she not asking for food which is surprising. 

I’m playing Elvis music for her lmao and she’s loving it. 😂😂😂😂😂

UPDATE

She finally went up to her bed and let me help her up. Literally when her head hit that pillow she knocked the fuck out. 

We’re all going bed now. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring but yeah. Thanks for still around guys. I’ll update tomorrow (today).

And also thanks for all the likes. This shit blew up lmaoo. 

UPDATE (NEXT MORNING 7:16 am)

I woke up early cause I just do that shit and my dad is up I think but I haven’t heard my mom. She’s usually up at like 6. 

I’m guessing she’s still tired from it but I’m getting up to check on her. I feel like like my dad is gonna be pissed. Then again he doesn’t really know about weed edibles or anything.

A lot of fucking people are saying that I poisoned my mom. I did not poison my mom. You’re insane for saying that. These are EDIBLES not fucking arsenic. She ate them herself after I told her not to. READ THE POST. She was just high as hell but mellowed out after like an hour and a half. My family and I calmed her down and made her comfortable and she went to bed close to 1 am. 

I would never poison my mom. So people accusing me of that are ridiculous. My mom is fine and alive.

Lastly, I’m tired of people assuming my race and gender lmao. Maybe the majority of the people in this subreddit are white males but I’m a Black female. Okay? Lol. I’m her daughter. 

My parents are Jamaican but no they’re not one of those “One love. One heart. Let’s smoke together and feel alright.” type Jamaicans. So that’s why telling them about the edible is probably the worst thing to do. 

I’m not a terrible person. Accidents happen. I’m not the first person whose parent has eaten their edible. This is why you don’t eat people’s food after they tell you not to. Alright? Geez. (Now people are going to think I’m an asshole for saying that.)

UPDATE (7:50 AM)

My mom is finally awake and she looks GONE. Like her eyes are droopy. However she getting suspicious.

“I think who ever made those cookies needs to learn to bake.” Baaaahh

No, because you got baked af last night... I’ll stop. 

I don’t know how she still woke up early but I can tell she still feels it. She’s just confused and saying weird things. She’s also really uncoordinated and irritated. 

I’m debating if I should just tell her but I don’t want to give her a bad image of weed. The other day we were literally talking about the benefits of it and now she’s going to think it’s a terrible drug... know her she’ll think they were laced with some hard drug like coke or something. 

She’ll never forget this though...

UPDATE (9:13 AM)

BROOO MY FUCKING BROTHER. 

Okay so basically my brother started playing Broccoli by DRAM and my mom was like “Why you have to play something so vulgar.” and my brother was like “Mom, listen to the song. I think you can relate a little.” And she was still confused and I was trying to eye my brother like “Don’t tell her!”

Then he fucking says “You ate ate an edible.”

My mom: “What’s an edible?” 

My brother: “It’s like weed made into food and you ate a whole one last night.”

I hate this motherfucker brooooo.

She’s so pissed now. We had this whole ass argument while my brother thinks it’s funny.

This man stays getting me in trouble. Omfggggg. 

LAST UPDATE (11:56 AM)

So she’s sober now as far as I know. She’s still very pissed after finding out. I lied and said I threw the other one away (wondering why she didn’t ask for proof). 

Her exact words when my brother told her it was an edible we’re. “Ya better be lyin’, ya see! If that cookie had drugs it- Jesus, Lawd...”😩🍪

My brother: “It just had weed.”😆🍁

My mom: “People ah smoke weed an’ demma eat deh something too? Mm mm. No. What if me was dead? Eh? Suppose me have a heart attack?”😡🇯🇲

Me: “No one has died from weed.” 😂

My mom: “You look here, likkle girl 👧🏽. Me nah listen to any of ya foolishness. Ya bring that somethin in me house again and you gon see what’s in store fah you!!” 😡😡

Bruh. I had to write it exactly how she said it or else it isn’t as accurate nor funny. So she basically just yelled at me and threaten me. Lol. I honestly don’t give a fuck. 😈Probably gonna smoke in this house and bring weed cause ya girl needs her weed so. 🤷🏽‍♀️

By the end of the day, she’ll cool down and one day we’ll all laugh about this. Don’t leave your freaking edibles out kids! Some of you White people are lucky. Your mom would probably be like “You ought to not let this happen again, Christopher. You’re grounded for two days. This is a warning.”. Lol joking... don’t get offended lmao.

Alright, I’m done lol.

UPDATE (9:03 PM)

So I ate a quarter of the edible that was left and brooo. That shit kicked me in the ass in just 40 minutes. I’m so high.... I almost forgot to post this",0

"I decided to quit smoking I am a 21 year old recently graduated history teacher, and as far as I can remember from my college days, I have smoked a lot. It consumed much of my money and my humor, the taste, now that I come to think of it, is awful, and the smell just really bothers me in the nose.

Therefore, I have made a decision. Everytime I have money to buy cigarettes, I'll go out and buy some weed, because that'll finally get me to stop smoking these damn cigarettes.

Sorry for fooling you there, if I did lolololololol",0

"86 yr old grandmother finally said yes to edibles This is such a wholesome post but a bit long yet I'm so excited....
My husband's grandmother who is 86 yrs old (very religious  and law abiding but lives in an illegal state) has had bone spurs that have kept her in bed alot. She was on oxycodone for years at a high dose and went through full withdrawal when her insurance stopped covering. DESPERATE for relief. 
She finally said she wanted edibles and I live in a legal state so a family member came to visit and brought her back some, thinking it might not work.  WELL, she ate one and is walking around without her walker, eating sandwiches and laughing at the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" as I type this.
I am over the moon for her.",0

"Anyone travel with weed in their checked luggage? I’m taking a trip coming up and don’t want the hassle of finding someone there. I am under 21 above 18, and flying between legal states. I am okay if it is confiscated, but just don’t want to risk getting a ticket. I feel that checked luggage is the best option for that. Thoughts?",0
