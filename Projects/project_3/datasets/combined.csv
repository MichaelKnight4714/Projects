"Cheese and dreams So a lot of you probably know about the experiment they did a couple years ago on specific cheese types giving you certain dreams. They tested with a few cheeses: stilton, cheddar, Cheshire, red Leicester, Lancashire.

Anybody else found a particular trend with other cheeses not listed here? Lately I've been eating gouda for the past 2 days and I not only had dreams (cause I usually don't) but they were unusually vivid. If you could note the type of dream (happy, nightmare, exciting, etc.) associated with the cheese, that would be cool. Thanks!",1

"Your opinion on letting cheese expire In another thread, u/kagemichaels mentions [that he lets Limburger expire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/bzl26p/if_you_could_only_eat_3_types_of_cheese_for_the/eqwlnrr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and that resonated with me since I tend to do the same thing with Limburger and other sort or semi-soft cheeses like Camembert or √âpoisses. The result is almost always amazing, the cheeses usually gain a ton of flavor, intensity and develop a sharpness the would never have had at their expiration date. 

Unfortunately, the result sometimes looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/nuv1bQ8.jpg) or even far worse, with a sunken rind or covered with tiny white freckles. Also some of these cheeses smell so strong that my wife demands that I repeatedly check if they are still edible.

Just to make that clear: I can tell an edible cheese from a spoiled one and make sure to always stay on the safe side. 

So what is this sub's on letting cheese expire? What if it has been out of the fridge for an elongated period of time or has been out on a cheese board far to long?",1

"[unpopular opinion?] Baguette and fresh bread &gt; crackers Lately i've been observing all these ""charcuterie boards"" and im kind of confused as to why every single one of you puts crackers on the side instead of freshly baked goods. Is this just some trend in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing better than a crisp baguette with a soft core to accompany my cheese.

Crackers are too salty and don't offer the complexity in taste and structure I deem ""delicious"".

Whole grain crackers aside, they're unhealty.

&amp;#x200B;

Change my mind.

Btw.: It's so damn easy to bake your own baguette. You even get to choose your prefered state of ""burned"" and the melting butter on top is something that let's me moan every time. Fuck crackers. :)",1

"Camembert - is it supposed to taste like that? I realize this is a lost cause as it's impossible to describe a taste properly, but: I bought some camembert two days ago because I always believe I'll love fancy cheeses and I'm always disappointed.   
But how is camembert supposed to taste? I've heard it tastes nutty and fruity. But all I tasted was this weird fermented taste, like something rotten, like fruit that has gone bad or orange juice that has gone off with a hint of ""regular"" cheese as an after-taste. I always imagined brie or camembert tasting like ""regular"" yellow cheese but more intense with strong overtones of spices...   
So, is that what camembert tastes like and what kind of cheese should I try if I wanna try a cheese that is more like cheese but stronger and more intense flavour?

https://www.snowdoniacheese.co.uk/cheese/black-bomber/

and i gotta say served by itself its unbelievable tasty, with a very unique taste with lots of little crunchy bits.

But one of my favourite snacks is to cook a paratha or a roti that i usually get frozen from my grocery store on a low heat until it starts bubbling and cut some pieces of cheese on it while its cooking and flip it over and kinda eat it like a makeshift grilled cheese.

my god i can not explain this fucking heavenly flavour.  this is hands down the most unique tasting thing ive ever tasted when its melted.  It's flavour profile completely changes and honestly this thing was worth every penny (8 CAD for 200grams).

That's all I want to say.",1

"Did they change Tillamook cheddar? Sorry if this is a weird post for this sub, didn't know where better to put it.

I've been getting Tillamook medium cheddar (pre-sliced) at Costco for something like 3-5ish years and it's been my favorite for something that's tasty, easy and not too pricey.

The last package I got though, the packaging was different. I figured it wouldn't really matter, right? I just made a couple quesadillas with it, though, and it's no longer the delicious gooeyness it has been. It smelled unusually strongly when I opened the package, the slices crumbled really easily, and after cooking the taste is kinda weird and the texture is just completely wrong, it's all curdley.

Did I just get a dud package or did they change their recipe or something? I recently tried Tillamook ice cream for the first time and had no complaints with that, so I didn't think they did anything weird, but this is the first time since long ago when I tried another brand's American that I put some cheese into my mouth and actually thought ""gross""

If it helps, I had just by happenstance not bought any more cheese for a while recently. I think the last time I got a package before this one was probably somewhere 3-6 months ago?",1

"How long can you keep a cut wheel of cheese? My fiance (originally from Switzerland) and I (British) love cheese and are thinking about getting a cheese wedding cake. The bottom 'tier' would be a 5-7kg full wheel of Swiss cheese, so similar in texture to Gruyere or Appenzeller but obviously much smaller than a Gruyere! (Marechal is our favourite but we're considering a few options.) Next tier up is likely to be Stilton or Stichelton.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the expected number of guests at our wedding and the expected total weight of the cheese wheels we will be ordering, there would probably be 2-3kg leftover from the wheel of Swiss cheese, and maybe 1kg leftover Stilton. If we take all the leftover cheese home with us, how long will the two different cheeses last in the fridge if wrapped in cheese paper?",1

I took that first bite and it literally tasted like semen. Cold, goopy, semen. I didn't know I had to let it sit for 30 minutes and get room temperature. Today after work I let it sit and adjust.

I love cheese, and have gotten my boyfriend to try a lot of new types.

He's had brie, and liked it, but he wished that it had a saltier taste. He hasn't had goat cheese, so I couldn't tell you his exact opinion on that.

I've tried to see if there is anything like a soft sharp cheddar, but they all seem to be cheese dips or spreads, rather than actual soft cheese. Maybe I'm just not that good at looking, so I'm sorry if this is something really obvious.

"Best One-Two Combos for Grilled Cheese? Could've asked at r/grilledcheese, I guess, but figured I'd consult the cheese experts first. 

Have been dealing with high blood sugar issues for a year now and have hence laid off bread during that time, which has been tough. Recently found a brand of bread at my local Meijer that's super-low carb and thus Grilled Cheeses are now an option in my life again!

Back when I was eating them more often, my go-to combination was Swiss + Cheddar. A relatively simple combo, but a tasty one: nice, smooth nuttiness from the Swiss and a cheesy sharpness from the Cheddar.

Now I'm looking to experiment more: Any flavor combinations of two cheeses that you've stumbled upon that might make a killer grilled cheese?",1
"Help! I have a cheese addictipn that‚Äôs destroying my body! Okay, so my entire life I‚Äôve been enjoying all forms of dairy. Like I‚Äôd drink 2 gallons of milk a week, eat cheese plain, all that.

Giving up milk was easy (since that affects me the worst), I replaced it with lactaid milk which I have no problem with. Butter was fairly easy too since there are vegetable based butters. BUT THERES NOTHING THAT CAN FILL THE VOID OF CHEESE!

SO my question, is there any lactose free cheeses? Anything similar enough to get me by? Idk if I‚Äôm even posting in the right subreddit but I‚Äôm honestly desperate. I feel so sick and tired every day because I‚Äôm also a night eater, and my go-to is cheese.",1

"Morbier: To rind, or not to rind? I had some (delicious) Morbier the other day from a restaurant on a cheese plate. It was already sliced up into small pieces, and the rind was still intact on either end of the piece. In fact, the rind was quite delicious: Lightly crunchy from the crystallization with a bit of funk and salt. Really complemented the meat of the cheese well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I bought a big slice of Morbier from the cheese shop the other day and I noticed something different. The rind near the ""back"" edge of the cheese (that is, where the outer edge of the wheel would be, basically) was extremely hard. Like hard enough that I'd just assume it was not edible.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, as you move towards the tip of the slice (what would be the center of a wheel), the rind gets noticeably softer. There's basically a gradient along the slice where it goes from incredibly hard to reasonably soft. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question: Do you just eat the rind up to the point where it becomes unpleasantly hard for your personal taste? That would be my assumption, I guess, but I wanted to get other people's opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question: I always thought Morbier was a washed rind cheese. But if that's the case, how could the rind of this slice I bought be so hard at the back? Has my assumption that all washed rind cheeses have \*soft\* rinds been wrong all along? Can washed rinds be hard??",1

While the texture is really nice, its def different than cheaper fetas ive bought. Is this normal for sheep milk cheese?

"Colby?? I came here after finding a short thread about someone looking for Colby a few years ago.  I'm currently trying to find it myself.  What's going on with it?  Is there suddenly some prejudice against it or is it not being made anymore?  For at least 40 years in Colorado I've been able to get it easily in the deli and the cheese section (slices, sticks, blocks, organic, non organic), and I did every time I went to the store.  It's been a favorite snack cheese all my life.  Suddenly, about a month ago, every store in my area (King Soopers, Safeway, Albertsons and Walmart) stopped carrying it.  All forms and brands gone.  Poof.  The only way it exists anymore is mixed up with the overpowering flavor of jack which I can't stand.  I saw, in that old thread, people saying that Colby is sharp, but it's about as mild as you can get and still have flavor.  I saw other people saying it's just like mild cheddar, but it's not.  It's not nearly as fatty or greasy as cheddar and it's more delicate in flavor.  This is what makes it a wonderful snacking cheese.  King Soopers even has a special cheese section that has cheeses from all over the world (many so specialized you've never heard of them) and super expensive ($5 or more for a bite sized square).  What happened to good Wisconsin Colby?  How can we get stores to carry it again?",1

It's made from Sheep's milk, and it says on the website it's ""Made in the traditional Dutch Gouda style,"" but this tastes nothing like any Gouda I've had before, so I'm hesitant to tell people it's ""Gouda"" because this is very different.

"Cheese vehicles besides crackers &amp; bread? I love cheese. And cheese on crackers, bread, biscuits, etc., has been one of my go-to snacks for years.

Of course cheese is delicious on its own. Of course it is. And I often will slice off a chunk of cheese and eat it solo.

"Flamb√© + Wheel ‚Äî Advice needed Anyone ever had the Bucatini all'Amatriciana flamb√® at Trattoria Vecchia Roma in Rome? This place and dish needs to be on the bucket list of any cheese fanatic.  It‚Äôs bucatini pasta in a red sauce with guanciale that is tossed into a wheel of pecorino that has been doused in alcohol and set afire.  The melted cheese gets mixed in with the pasta, and it‚Äôs quite possibly the greatest meal in the world.  My buddy, who is a fantastic amateur cook, keeps talking about flying back to Rome just to eat at that restaurant.  

Here‚Äôs where I need your help. He has basically reverse-engineered the dish that it tastes very, very close to what we hadn‚Äôt in Rome.  He wants to take it a step further and get the wheel of pecorino.  Costco sells a 50-pound wheel for $330.  It‚Äôs not the best pecorino, but it‚Äôs good enough.   I think what he‚Äôs looking to do is to host dinner parties for friends.  The flamb√© is something that is rarely if ever seen in the US, so it would be quite unique.  Get a few friends to chip in, and you‚Äôve got a bunch of dinners in 2019.   

Let‚Äôs set aside how bad of an idea this could be.  It‚Äôs only $330, so that‚Äôs not going to bankrupt anyone.  Cheese will assuredly get wasted, but chunks can be given away to attendees.  Where I need your expertise is what steps you would take to ensure this could reasonably work.  

Here are my thoughts as to what we need:

1) Hired help to start the wheel.  I think we need to pay the guy at the local cheese shop to chizzle out the top of this thing to start it so it‚Äôs able to be a bowl for pasta to be dumped into.  

2) Freezer/vacuum bag for the wheel.  After each meal, put it in the vacuum bag and freeze it.  Pull it out a day or two in advance of the next meal. Repeat as needed. 

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve come up with.  Any constructive guidance, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  I‚Äôve noticed experts and aficionados on this sub, and your tips could go a long way to making sure this concept isn‚Äôt a complete disaster.

"One of my favorite Italian cheeses: Gorgonzola! Gorgonzola is a blue [Italian cheese](https://www.gianlucatognon.com/indulging-in-italian-cheese/) produced from pasteurized whole cow‚Äôs milk with the addition of enzymes and selected moulds. It was first made in the town of Gorgonzola, in the north of Italy, at the end of the 10th century.

There are two types of Gorgonzola, sweet and savory. I like the first which is a mix of creamy and more solid parts. According to the legend, this mix of two parts of different consistency came from the fact that a young dairyman, lingering with his girlfriend, failed to complete the work of the day, postponing it to the following day. By mixing the curd of the evening with the one of the morning, he inadvertently managed to create a cheese which had never been produced before.

"Attempting to find ""American Style"" cheddar in Europe BIG DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT MEAN THE PROCESSED CHEESE PRODUCT. American style is in quotes because I don't know the correct term

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm an American that has moved to Europe. The cheese scene is excellent but I have been craving a nice sharp cheddar. Problem is the British Style sharp cheddars don't seem to match what I expect from a sharp cheddar. The cheddar I'm looking for could be described as sour, but I've been stopping at several cheesemongers where I live and the best they can do with that description is ""well we have some really fresh goat cheese"" (delicious but not cheddar). Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Am I missing some critical term or searching in the wrong places?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills since the information I can find online doesn't seem to mention this difference at all. I'd almost suspect I'm talking about the fake cheese except for that I remember clearly loving a cheddar I got from a local cheese maker in the US with that exact sour flavor. I hope my cheddar memories aren't a lie

Is it really because they do not use the cow species fed by grass only from a certain area of Italy?  I have a doubt, because the taste is just about the same to my palate.

Does this parmesan have the same wheel breaking process as real Parmigiano-Reggiano?  Looking at its texture, I doubt it.

"What is this cheese?! Please help! üßÄüò¢ The context is that I told the people in charge of a charcuterie board situation at work to get cheese from two different places - 1. A supermarket in Toronto 2. A local deli/cheese/butcher shop, so this cheese could be from either place. On the night of said party, people were all leaving and we decided to just cut chunks of cheese from the boards and take them home as they'd just sit around over the weekend. I took a chunk of manchego and then spotted this guy and took a chunk off too.

The clues:

1. I know it said Castello and 'mild' on the rind of the wedge. Bear in mind, it was a wedge and not a block. It also was not a Castello mild blue cheese, trust me, I looked.
2. It had a light blue Castello motif but the chunk I cut off has neither of these marks. Was I imagining all of this? Let's hope not.
3. The cheese itself is white, but around the interior layer of the rind, it yellows a bit.
4. Very strong savoury taste, almost like cheddar but I don't think it's that..
5. Texture wise - it's not soft like a brie, a blue, a gorgonzola or a mature cheese like a parmesan. It's a little creamier than an aged cheddar I'd say, and has more white than yellow colour wise. Perhaps a goat's cheese? It reminds me a little of a less mature version of an Ontarian bandaged goat's cheese cheddar I've had before.
6. White wax rind, but with another layer below of ridged... rind..? I don't know what it is.
7. Last thing - Castello makes a ton of packaged blue cheeses. This was not packaged in that manner, it was definitely a wedge taken from a wheel and re-sold. The thing that's throwing me is that I can't find any other Castello cheeses with their logo printed on the actual outside of the wheel, sort of in the Louis Vuitton fashion.
8. I have googled 'white waxed Castello cheese' 'white mild Castello cheese' and 'Castello white wax blue logo cheese that's also white inside but has another layer and also tastes very nice' and can Google no more.
9. These sad photos of the cheese chunk may offer some more hints. I don't know.

Aaaaaagh.

Being more or less ignorant of the cheese market and politics outside of the US and Canada, this made me curious. Is there a reason for Kiwi cheese dominating the market in this little corner of the world, or is it just a coincidence? NZ seems like the least likely place from which to import cheese to the West Indies, and yet it seemed ubiquitous. ",1

"Camembert (supermarket) I bought some olive bread (which is salty) and a round of Camembert (which is mild) to have pre-dinner tonight. 

However, when I unwrap the Camembert wheel it 1) is spotted with small brown spots on the rind instead of a smooth whitish color, and 2) smells unusual, like a faint ammonia aroma. I cut about a third of the wheel off and it's runny and bright yellow so I figure it's good. But the taste is off, like a stale salty taste is the best I can describe it.

I just bought it today so I thought wow that's odd. Then I check the best buy date and it says 1/29/19. Would this still be considered ok to eat and serve to a dinner guest? What would you do?",1

"Need a name for a type of cheese Back where I'm from, you could get a kind of farmer's market kind of cheese that I love, but I would not have any idea how to ask for it, or look for it in the U.S.I assume it's not available for purchase in chain stores, since it's a fresh kind of cheese.

My best description of it is:

1.  It's a white cheese.
2.  It's tender, in between squishy and solid block cheese.
3. Creamy.
4. You buy it in blocks.
5. When you slice, your knife will have some of the creamy texture on it afterward.
6. Very slightly salty.
7. Nice slightly sour taste that stays in your mouth (the sourness is not as much as yogurt).
8. It does not have a strong smell.
9. It's not brittle (a given since it's fresh and creamy).
10. Not full of holes.

"""Did you seize the cheese?"" I woke to the sound of front door being slammed closed this morning at 2:20am. Still half asleep, I went to my kitchen and discovered the window wide open, and the screen gone. All the items from my window sill were mysteriously placed outside on the deck. The discovery was especially terrifying to the girl who happened to be spending the night at my house.

I started assessing what belongings the greasy thief could have grabbed. My ASUS Ultrabook was on the counter directly next to the scene of the crime. My work room full of laptops, desktops, and shelves of computer parts for my small business were seemingly untouched. My watch, car keys, television, consoles and other items were not disturbed either.

I phoned the incident into the local town police, who arrived around 3:00am. The officer questioned me about what could be missing, ""This may seem weird, but would you check if anything is missing from your refrigerator?"". All the major items were also undisturbed. At a second glance I realized my 24 pack of Kraft Singles processed cheese slices were missing. The office than spoke into his radio, ""Did you seize the cheese?"". A forensic investigation followed, searching for footprints, fingerprints, while capturing pictures and statements.

Another call was made to police a few houses down, shortly after my incident, reported an intoxicated man walking down the street. When police caught up to him, they seized my individually wrapped cheese slices from him. I never expected something like this to happen in my small Canadian town.",1

"I quit Vaping I quit Vaping and went back to smoking because no matter what form of Vaping i was doing it made me gag and cough. I even have a volcano so it isn't my device. Tried e juice, nope. Distillate, nope. And several crappy versions that are worse than smoking like Mct oil carts. Once got coconut oil when they claimed it was wax cartridge. 

Anything i try only tastes good for a second then I'm coughing a lung. And that burnt popcorn or beans taste is awful. Abv edibles taste terrible too.

I think it's unhealthy in comparison to smoking especially e juice and distillate, not enough research to say it's healthier especially with Vaping flavors and terpenes which in my experience terpenes burn easy and i mean bad burn. And Vaping dry herb feels like water vapor instead of actual cannabinoids

Smoking gets it all into you and Vaping gets you some then you have abv....it's a shame i wanted it to work. i actually use more herb Vaping then smoking and i get less high Vaping

Anyone else feel this way? 

I'm tired of coughing and getting barely high. I smoke a joint and I'm good for at least 2-3 hours but when i vape I'm like itching for relief within half an hour. By my math i can smoke .5 in five minutes and vape it in an hour. So clearly Vaping is not efficient.

I know I'm not doing it wrong because I've tried several devices and methods over five years. I'm finally done trying lol. Smoking tastes and feels better plus is faster.",0

"Concentrate inside or outside a joint? Which do you prefer? So I'm stoned and I'm contemplating dank joints and how they are made.

I was wondering what people think is the best method to roll a joint with concentrate (kief, wax, shatter, etc), inside the joint or outside, and why?

To answer my own question i feel like it's a waste to put concentrate on the outside because your smoking what's inside the joint not outside. I mean like I've rolled em that way and i never feel i get the full effect like when it's rolled inside. Sure it looks pretty outside and you can make art out of it but it's only gonna burn off and not really get in you. I'm sure some will but it's not efficient. Maybe it's better for sharing or hot boxing because it gets everywhere lol unlike when it's inside it kinda would go into one person in one fat rip and everyone else wouldn't get any. I've experienced this with friends.

So i like it inside (that's what she said!) Cuz i usually smoke alone and don't hot box anymore.

"Developing discipline/moderation? I‚Äôve never had moderation with drugs or alcohol or anything else. Now that I‚Äôve been sober for 3 years I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I can actually do things in moderation if I just try.

One thing I realized from coffee is that I‚Äôll quit for months or even years and one day decide to go back and automatically start drinking it every day even multiple times.

Yesterday I drank a latte after 4 months off. I told myself I would have a latte once every two weeks from now on, and if I can do that for a year and it gets easier, then after a year I will try drinking alcohol or smoking weed once every 2-3 weeks.

I kind of wanted coffee again today but didn‚Äôt, and this is probably my first time going back to something and not having it again the next day so it‚Äôs already a big thing for me. I‚Äôm realizing that if I just set the goal I can actually do it.

My hope is that since I have 3 years off of weed and alcohol, I will be less dependent on it if I go back. Like I‚Äôll be able to take it or leave it.

"weed made me hate my date and myself      i met up with this guy who ive been secretly talking to for the last few months for the second time yesterday. we both had our first kiss together the first time we met up. i really do think i loved him. and its crazy because i talk about it like it all happened years ago and it didnt. yesterday we met up again a second time and got high and all of a sudden i just started hating him for no reason. i didnt want him near me, i didnt want his arm around me or him close to my face. 
      i ended up feeling so bad that i ended our little date thing early because we just were sorta sitting in a little opening in a forest in complete silence. honestly it was a really scary high. i was paranoid and upset that i couldnt figure our why i was feeling so apathetic towards him, and then i started thinking about how i dont love anything, that i just might not be able to be chained down by a person or a relationship, and that i was meant to be free and a loner that would just live to have lots of experiences and stories to tell. 
     i understand that might not seem like a bad thing but it completely goes against everything i thought i wanted, and its like this dark cloud looming over me telling me i should just be alone. ive tried talking to him about just these complex and weird emotions ive been having the last two days and he just doesnt really seem to care about how i feel, albeit, hes also been insanely high himself. he usually gets like this while high.
    the thing is, this high was really weird for me though, not like what i usually feel and i havent quite experienced anything like it before so its just making it really hard to understand how much of it was something i should worry about and how much i should just shrug off and blame the weed on. 
     i just felt so disappointed in myself. like i kept getting these flashbacks to distant memories from my childhood i thought id forgotten and i would think about everything i thought i would be when i was my age now and what i thought i was going to be like as a child is nothing like how ive turned out. i feel like an embarrassment and that i ruin everybody.",0

"Crazy visuals after smoking for the first time right so I was with a few friends heading to a park to smoke, I remember only having a few puffs and then after about 20 minutes everything started to look cartoon-ish, 2D or very blurry and just weird in general is the best way I can describe it, it looked so surreal and I couldn't properly focus my eyes on anything, it got progressively worse throughout the high, everything was lagging its like my brain was overloaded and was only able to take snapshots of what was happening a few seconds prior. Also I remember just looking at my boyfriend and zoning out completely and tripping balls and then I came back to reality. It felt like I was tripping for 10 minutes but it was actually just two seconds. I dont know if this makes much sense but has anything similar to this happened to any of you?",0

"Still feel weird 3 days after smoking Hey everyone! 
Decided to ask here before totally freaking out and going to the doctor. I smoked from a bong about 3 days ago and am still feeling numbness in my body and a general feeling of disconnection, floatiness and brain fog. I feel sort of ""out of it"" and not like myself. 

Some background info: I've only smoked a couple of times before. When I smoke after drinking I experience memory loss for the period after the weed kicks in. I also had a severe panic attack the first time I had edibles(there was way too much in them obviously) where I was tripping balls and thought I was dying(ended up calling 911). Now leading up to this moment, I've smoked like 3 times within a week. 2 of those times were a bad experience(though not as bad as the edibles experience) and I got close to having a full-blown panic attack when I smoked from the bong 3 days ago. 

My question is whether this is something I should see a doctor for or if I should wait longer for these symptoms to go away on their own?",0
"Any good strains for people who get anxiety attacks? Half of the time I ever done weed my heart rate would race uncontrollably, I would get this impending feeling of dread and I would become convinced I was going to die?

"Worst high of my life so far. Iv been smoking some what regularly for a little over a year now . earlier today I smoked like I usually do, the usual amount. at first I was having fun I made myself a late breakfast and watched some youtube videos I was having a good time. At like the 45 min mark I was having a horrible time. my mind kept racing I couldn't concentrate on one thing. So as my mind kept thinking my thoughts really got out of control. I didn't feel like myself. I felt as if everything I had ever known even myself was complexity fabricated. Nothing seemed real in the slightest bit and I was having a hard time coming to terms with it.  That was the worst part of my experience this time I couldn't understand why life was real, or who I was, nothing in the world we lived in made sense. I thought maybe I was too high and watched a video and everything the lady said in the video made it worse. So its a little while later and I decide to go my room so I could sleep it off. I just wanted it to be over. But then I couldn't get comfortable what so ever. eventually I did after I freaked out some more. I turned on some music and fell asleep. when found some songs that didn't provoke my mind to think about any and everything. I was wondering has this happened to anybody else? is this common? is there a name for it ?",0

i had a mild psychedelic experience while stoned i vaped two or three mflb trenches back to back and then took three hits of CBD flower. i immediately felt like i was greening out as i exhaled the last hit of CBD. i walked to my bed and laid down on my back and closed my eyes. i saw dark shapes on the black background dancing around my visual field. purple triangles and light zigzags and green globs not dissimilar to ketamine closed eye visuals. i was scared that my weed was laced because ive never had visuals with weed before. i remembered that i had been smoking this stash for a week and was fine then i calmed down. then i saw bright light spirals that slowly faded into the distance. my FOV was black but i felt joy and calm. i fell asleep shortly afterward.,0

In the past couple of weeks, however I've found I've been paranoid to the point I've believed that I've been followed by multiple people and that they're all connected and following me. 

I know this is obviously stupid and the logic in my brain tries to overrule it but it just doesn't happen. Even when I'm alone I'll sit and worry myself into a stupid hole.

I'll wait it out and an hour or so later the CBD kicks in and I'm all good, chillin n everything. I'm just wondering if anyone has an understanding of what I'm dealing with, whether it's my own problem that is amplified by smoking or whether I should cut weed out for a bit or even if when I'm smoking I should smoke more so that I'm hit with more CBD initially which will mellow me out to start? 

As you can see I'm quite unsure so any help would be appreciated, hopefully if anyone else is struggling with this and just wants to chill they'll be able to help themselves too!

After I went home I felt a bit high after  feeling sober for like 1h after the nicotine and alcohol. I once read that you can fail a thc test after doing sports even though you smoked weed months before because some thc might be stored in your body fats. I accidentally drank the part with the most butter from a thc tea so I probably hat thc from like 7g of weed therefore I got really fried and I ate a lot.
 My theory is, that I had a lot of thc in my fat and I lost it while dancing to get high afterwards. It might be placebo but it really felt like being high.",0

"Smoking weed ruined my life I live in a country in which weed isn‚Äôt legal so you have to get it from dealers without rly knowing what substances are actually  inside the pot you‚Äôre buying. I never bought weed but I used to smoke my friends‚Äô and every time everything played out as I expected it to: I got high, it felt amazing and a few hours later I was back to being my usual  self. 

Well that I was until I smoked with these friends that I‚Äôm not very close with for the first time, it was this shitty-looking hash that I‚Äôm almost certain was laced with some crap cos I had a massive panic attack while on it, had an awful headache accompanied by nausea and terrible brain fog and the worst part was that I smoked it about three weeks ago and I feel like I never properly came down from that high.

"i need somes advices guys please so, basically i'm a french-guy and i used to smoke weed with somes friends back in high-school

Now i'm grown-up, and most of my friends went-away

I got a job, i work everydays, it's a pretty physical one too

And i got pretty-shitty superiors who do nothing all-day long,

But still manage to throw shit at me for coming 10-minutes lates one-day in the span of 9 months

It's tiring, and my life as been stressful for some-times now

So i just want to blow some steam-off at the end of the week basically

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been thinking of smoking weed again

The thing is:

\-i absolutely hate tobacco

\-and my friends went-away and we stopped talking since years because we all had to do our lifes separated

&amp;#x200B;

I still take somes news from them, because i want to keep contact and know if they're having a good-life

It would be extremely awkward and insincere from me to just straight-up ask them to put me in contact with somes dealers near my location

&amp;#x200B;

So basically

I've been thinking about growing weed

It's illegal to smoke, or grow-it here, but it's not illegal to buy seeds

Don't ask-me why, it's stupid, that's all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty alright at gardening flowers, fruits, and vegetables

So i think it wouldn't be too hard for me

But i have no ideas what kind of seeds i should-buy, or how to make-it grow

When the plant will be grown-up, how do i ""extract""-it?

And how should i consume it, i don't really want to go back to smoke with cigs, i hate-it

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be alright to just buy the ""finished-product"" from someone

But since it's reddit, i guess most of you guys are not in France, which would make it impossible

And it would probably be illegal and i wouldn't want to put anyone in troubles for this",0

"Eye twitch ? Hi guys,

So i'm vaping concentrate (only 3 puffs at night before going to sleep) and I usually get the rose gold from Bloom farms. Now about a month ago my dispensary advised me to try Unwind from Ace extracts and after smoking it I developped a left eye twitch.

What I notice is if I don't smoke for like 2 days, the eye twitch goes away and if I smoke, sure enough the next morning it comes back.

Do you think it's something in the Ace extracts product that might trigger this or is it weed in general? I've been smoking weed for years and never had this before but maybe I'm getting older and that's what weed does to me now.

I'll definitely get back to rose gold after I finish to use the Unwind but was wondering if any of you had experience with this issue.

"My heart almost stopped after smoking weed. Recently around a month ago I was hospitalized for smoking weed, i smoked out of a vaporizer which I found out later had to do with it. This particular vape hit really hard and always had you high to the point where you‚Äôd be so lazy that you wish you could move but you couldn‚Äôt.
 After I‚Äôm done, maybe around 20 minutes, my heart starts beating so fast that my chest starts feeling hot to the touch and I start getting the symptoms of a heart attack, I am young and my heart has always been healthy and stable. My jaw started to feel weird and my whole left side went limp and it felt like my bicep was being pulled apart from end to end. It was so intense that I thought I could be having a Charlie horse. 
It had got so intense that I had to go to the hospital and I‚Äôm not like any of those people who gets so high that they go to the hospital because there scared, no there was actually something wrong.
But it was only till after the hospital visit I learned that my heart could of actually stopped. I have an app on my phone called heart rate free and it‚Äôs 100% accurate (I tested it at the hospital with the machine next to me) and before I even thought about going to the hospital it read 175 bmp which was very dangerous for me to have been laying down doing nothing. It had been going for hours and  I was scared I had a blood clot or something was wrong with my heart. But it was just doing its job because when I got to the hospital and they ran blood tests I found out the large amounts of thc in my system were making me dehydrated and thickening up my blood making my heart work way harder than it needed to. If I would‚Äôve stayed at home I could‚Äôve had a heart attack and died cause that was was slowly happening. My heart needed to beat faster to get more blood to my organs but I found out the faster it went the more blood and hydration it would need but since I was dried up it was basically doing everything it could to stay alive. The hospital realized this and quickly put fluids in me and re-hydrated me which is when my heart rate of 190 went down to 100 which is how they double checked from the blood tests that it was the problem because my heart stated to calm down after it. They told me to be careful and sent me home where it went down even more from that. 

What I‚Äôm saying is that nobody can die from weed but you can die from dehydration. And  It still scares me to this day knowing that I could‚Äôve died from it. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed since and I‚Äôm not planning too because hours of constant beating at high Bpm‚Äôs can really affect your hearts health and I‚Äôm worried if it happens again I won‚Äôt be able to live to tell the story again. Be safe when smoking large amounts and especially if your hot boxing bring as much water as you can. Believe it or not it could save your life. And remember this, if your eyes and your mouth are super dry, your organs are the same way. Stay safe.",0

So here's the thing - I recently went to the local confectionery store and talked to this guy about buying some oil. My intention was to put some hybrid / sativa based oil Double Delicious (Seattle supplier)  into my own cookies and such. I've recently moved to the UK and bought a vape pen and put some of the oil in the pen. However I think that the guy at the pot shop told me the wrong info because on the back of the packaging it says that there is coconut oil in this item and says for external use only. So I think the shit I bought is a topical oil.

- did I just fuck up my vape pen by putting a topical oil in it?

- are there negative health affects by vaping a topical oil?

- Does anyone know anything about the brand Double Delicious from Tacoma Seattle? Do you think I was sold a topical oil or something else?

"Coming out of a grow box. Hi fellow potheads.

I have been smoking for something close to 10 years now. I tried to quit but, even after almost 4 months of absolute abstinence I did not see any benefits. 

I mean the short term memory improved , but I was so tense and sleepless and pissed off that the total effect was negative.

Looks like i am one of those who need to smoke to function. 

Well I want to come out with it and stop hiding and just smoke whenever I want.

But the problem is that weed is considered illegal in my country. 

I mean I can make it legal just for me as a medicine, but still being a pothead is frown upon. 

Any advices ? 

Should I even come out with that? And if not, do any of you have pro tips regarding smoking at work.

"The Boundy Buds So this is a story about some friends of mine, about a ""strain"" that we smoked for awhile that was wack. So a guy named Boundy grows weed, the weed is called boundy bud and from my short experience is full skitz, now I've done my fair share of psychedelics so weed now is still just a one way ticket to a trip, I was there for one of these events and heard about the other last night, first event was with a mate who we will call Tom asked me to pack him a phat cone and I did, he was already pretty stoned and we had a new massive party sized cone piece, so he punched the cone pulled it through was fine, maybe an hour passes and he asks for another this is where shit hits the fan a bit, I packed it to the rim was a bit bigger than the last one but i thought he would be fine but yeah nah, punches it pull it through looks like hes gonna green, i was thinking she'll be right, he was on the ground at this point and gets up stumbling around and blacks out falling smashing his head into a wood been a cutting his face up pretty bad then well having a seizure for no longer than 5 seconds, full fucked, he was alright after just really out of it but we took care of him and having his girlfriend there helping him out all night, he was fine  and still smokes weed.
So I asked him about it and he said it had happened before on the same strain maybe two weeks prior, got me thinking that it wasn't him hitting his head that caused it and more evidence has come to light, so this other mate we will call Ted had apparently been punching cones all night asked for one more and had blacked out and had a seizure as well for again no longer than 5 seconds.

Little did I know, apparently it was hitting fine.

I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. I remember asking them if I fell asleep I must've sounded like a fucking psycho cause it was like 15 seconds after I handed them a J. It felt like an hour or two for me. After that I just kinda sat there while they smoked the rest. Through the next 20 mins or so. My vision was fucked like it is when you get a blood rush. I was almost nauseous and got really dizzy when I stood up. I remember two images that would morph back from each other the whole time when I closed my eyes. One was a family portrait that hung in the living room of my house. And the other was the old red black and white buffalo sabres logo. To this day I have no idea what happened. I just assume it had something to do with the dope and my body cause they smoked the same thing and we're fine. Have you guys ever had something similar happen or know what that could've been.",0

&amp;#x200B;

The other night (Friday) I went to a party. I was drinking whisky at first and then I was offered some weed, so I was like hell yh and smoked the shit out of it. About 10 minutes later I started feeling really trippy. I started to feel like nothing was real like I wasn't real. Then I went and sat down for a bit and after I got up when I walked it was like I was teleporting about. I continued to drink and then I started to hear that people weren't actually saying. Well, I'm not sure if they were actually saying these things but I think it was something I hallucinated. I asked my older brother what it was and he said it was something called sycosis. I looked into what that sycosis is and it sounded like what I experienced but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After that night it has felt like I am still slightly detached from my mind and body and every so often I will feel like nothing is real. I have started to smoke a lot more than I'm used to if that helps.

"What's Your Top 3 Favorite Strains At The Moment And Why? Love this community of beautiful weed smokers, Ha-Ha.

&amp;#x200B;

(Sativa) Laughing Buddha: makes you more giggly and personally makes me more talkative and focused, and a massive cerebral wave radiates from my body. Overall a great daytime strain, pure happiness and upbeat for hours. 

(Hybrid) Cookie Breath: This strain is a ""couch lock"" if you smoke a lot. It makes your body melt into whatever you're sitting or laying on; can be used for nighttime or daytime use. A blissful mood washes over your entire body - euphoric. 

(Indica) Casper OG: My favorite stain for sleeping at the moment, personally. It calms the mind and almost feels like it forces you to lay down, your mind is very, very calm. You hit the bed numb, euphoric and not wanting to move. You fall into a deep, relaxing sleep.",0

No matter what I smoke out of I get it, I have also tried different strains and still my dry mouth is embarrassingly bad.

"Weed teaches me. Im 17, I haven‚Äôt smoked pot very much, and I don‚Äôt smoke often at all, but then again, I‚Äôm probably too young to be smoking pot in the first place. I‚Äôd like to think of myself as pretty mature for my age, and while my friends are off their faces laughing and having fun, it seems that weed makes me hallucinate mildly. I have not done any drugs other than weed, but I get mild visuals both open and close eyed, more often than not while my eyes are opened. Every time it feels like those visuals try to teach me something or deliver me a message, most the time it is when music is playing. On the come up I almost always get a roller coaster visual that makes me believe that what the plant is trying to tell me is that I‚Äôm still at the beginning of the road but that I‚Äôm about to blast off because I do struggle with my sense of confidence a lot. I‚Äôve also been shown myself on a stage a few times which it makes me feel better overall because I am an artist and it feels like it is telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôll make it, your hard work WILL pay off, just keep working‚Äù.  The high also lasts me much longer than my friends, feeling after effects for quite a while after smoking, up to days at a time, so I always smoke when I know I have nothing important to do for at least the next whole day. (Went to work once and it was wild, felt like I was high my whole shift‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I get a LOT of enjoyment and recreation off weed, and I know my shit isn‚Äôt laced (none of my friends hallucinate either) but it feels like weed often interrupts the ‚Äúfun‚Äù in a good way, to teach me something or send me a message. Yeah that‚Äôs all I have I just thought I‚Äôd share it with all y‚Äôall! Peace. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Anyone use the Truva Mini 2.0? or vape herb in general? i am trying out the truva mini 2.0 and it smells like burnt popcorn. ive tried going online to find reasons behind it and its only tips for vape juice and not convection for dry herb. i think the default temp was 385. ive tried 400 then dropped to 300 then moved up to 350 as i was barely pulling any hits. like i was inhaling so hard i was getting high off inhaling too hard and not the herb. Lastly, how do you know when your done? when i look into the chamber and see that the herb has turned and orange/brownish color im assuming ive ""sucked it dry"" and theres no more?

"Weed &amp; Neurological disorders So for a little background, I am 19 and I have several neurological conditions, listed below

Tourette Syndrome

OCD

ADHD

Anxiety

Aspergers/Mild Autism-unofficial diagnosis, I have been told by several neurologists and therapists that I have it, but going thru the diagnosis process isn‚Äôt worth it since I don‚Äôt take medicine for anything.

So I have used marijuana for 8-10 months at this point, I never really smoke more than once or twice every 3 months. I have not taken any prescription medication for my neurological conditions in 6+ years, but I have noticed marijuana does have a profound effect on my conditions. 

After smoking, I have less noticeable tics from my TS, even tho my TS is already very mild. I also have an easier time dismissing obsessive thoughts and have less anxiety, I have yet to study my ADHD while high; however, I noticed I have higher social function when I am high. 
Those effects aside, I have also noticed some after effects when I loose the high‚Ä¶

For a period of 1-2 months after smoking I notice I can focus better, have less anxiety, and less issues with mood and my disorders. After some research, I believe this to be attributed to weed‚Äôs affects on serotonin levels. CBD acts like serotonin and THC has been reported to negatively effect the ability of serotonin reuptake. I believe this makes weed act like an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), resulting in increased free serotonin levels in my body for a period of time after smoking weed.

Please tell me your thoughts on the subject and post any questions you have for me. I‚Äôm just as curious as you may be about this!",0

"Creativity &gt; Disassociation Hi there! 1st posting here. 
I was wondering if anyone knows if there's any strains that won't induce so much depersonalization/derealization. I have mental illnesses, but smoking sometimes helps me to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. Helps me to write my mind out, too, which is great. But sometimes I get badly disassociated and it friggin sucks cuz I suffer from this, anyway. 
How can I take advantage of the good benefits and not feel awful at the same time? D:
I know this is a long shot, but I would love some advice.

"Ever since I ate an edible I‚Äôve been feeling depressed. I know I have posted this question before I do apologize but I feel like I want more answers :( First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it‚Äôs very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I‚Äôm saying, feeling like I‚Äôm not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I‚Äôm talking and it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôm not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I‚Äôve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it‚Äôs making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( I feel hopeless",0

For myself, i've been in the ballpark of about 3 times a day and a 4th every week for a pretty long time, but i'd be curious to see how other people's tolerances, preferences, circumstances, or just general inclination would differ from mine, especially with something as specific and varied as cannabis.

Side note, if you like i'd also be curious to know how much you think is best for someone who is a regular cannabis user, or how much you'd like to consume compared how much you do currently.",0

"Does weed make you lose weight? Some of my family members and family friends look very skinny, not anorexic, but skinny enough for others to notice and be concerned about. My cousins (family friends) look very pale, skinny, face sunken in a little. They smoke like fucking trains. Recently one of them had a baby and thankfully gained weight back so she looks a lot better now. Unless they're doing other drugs like popping pills along with smoking. 

I'd like to start smoking for my anxiety and honesty for fun as well. I obviously don't want to smoke every single day, just every once in a while. I have to approach this to my parents (I'm 18, still living a home obviously. Why wouldn't I get their permission?). My mom used to smoke when she was teenager, this back in the late 80s, early-mid 90s. So I'm pretty sure that the 1990 weed and 2019 weed are completely different now. More chemicals, I guess. Maybe they put chemicals in the plants to speed up the growing process and that's what makes people skinny? 

Anyways I'm just afraid that if I start smoking, I may lose a significant amount of weight. I'm only 120lbs, 5'5"" so put that into perspective.",0

"Fuck my life So after some time saving money i finally ordered my oil pen 2 days ago(thursday july 4).I did my research and ordered it from a well known supplier here in my country. In the courrier's app it said it will arrive on monday (july 8). The pen ended up  arriving today saturday (july 6). To my surprise,my mom wakes me up saying that a package has arrived for me. ""OH SHIT""was all i could think about  and she obviously saw it on my face.The doorman had called to notify about the package and she  had  recieved it...I planned on giving him(doorman) the heads-up to not give the package to ANYONE BUT ME and give him the shipping money , eventually...Since i still (in theory) had a few days left before it arrived.Long story short I told my mom the package that had arrived was a ps4 game as i went towards my bedroom.She came right behind me and asked me to open it and show it to her.So i did... I already knew i was fucked anyways...   
I Opened it and only showed the battery.She looked at the opened package and saw the cartidge's packaging that fucking says THC CANNABIS OIL all over it.

Fuck man... she was so fucking sad and pissed.
She returned to my room a few minutes later crying saying that this was too much for her and that she's worried about me.She asked me the whole worried-mom questions like ""You were smoking all these time,why do you do this? I cant trust you"" (she absolutely hates all drugs and never had to deal with any of these things in my family).It broke her heart.And in return it broke mine too.I've been a stoner for a few years now and i've always have been very obsessed about my family not catching me. My mom catched me like a year ago and i told her it was a one time thing.She gave me the benefit of the doubt i guess and gave me another chance.I fucking blew it in such a stupid way.What the fuck do i do now?

i started smoking at 13 with my brother, and it was fun, nights out in the back garden, but i stoped for a year.

Last night I smoked, however and the usual happened: I started noticing all the social and personal mistakes I make and seeing how I could fix them.

"One time I got so high I couldn‚Äôt understand English anymore (sadly this is not a joke lol) So a while back, I went on a 3 month tolerance break, and upon coming back, I decided to take a fat. ass. bonger. This bonger fucked my shit, no joke, let me explain to you how this bonger made me unable to understand what people were saying. Something you should no first, is that my memory is notoriously bad when I‚Äôm high, but this time was different, my memory would only last for a couple of seconds at a time, it was so bad, I would forget entire sentences while they were being spoken to me. For example, one of my friends asked me ‚Äúdid you have a test yesterday‚Äù and I was just like ‚Äúuuuuhhhh... what did you just say?‚Äù And they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúdid you have a test?‚Äù And I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù And they‚Äôd say ‚Äúyesterday!‚Äù And then I would say ‚Äúwhat happened yesterday?‚Äù. It was bad, I knew the words coming out of their mouths, but I couldn‚Äôt remember them long enough to form an actual sentence in my mind, so it just sounded like a bunch of words that had nothing to do with each other. At one point, someone would be talking to me, and then I would get hung up on something they said and then just think about it for like 15 seconds while they continued to talk, then when I was done thinking I would just walk away because I forgot that they were talking to me, then they‚Äôd come up and be like ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù And I‚Äôd say ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù and then he would say ‚ÄúI was talking to you‚Äù and I would just be like ‚Äúreally? When?‚Äù. Basically, for an hour and a half, I was trapped inside my mind and my shitty memory, my memory got so bad, that at one point, I thought I was stuck in a loop, because I would be listening to my friend talking to someone, then walk away, come back 2 mins later and that person is still talking to someone, I‚Äôd sit down and start listening, then I‚Äôd think ‚Äúwoah, I was just here listening to this exact convo‚Äù (which it wasn‚Äôt), I would then get up, walk away and come back to do it over again. And I have never been so zooked in my entire life since then, probably never will be.",0
"My first REAL experience As the title says, this would be the story of the first real time I‚Äôve actually smoked weed. Before you ask, I‚Äôve taken 1-2 hits off a bong or off a joint before this. Not enough to get me high or to actually really feel anything. Pretty much blue balls for getting high. 
.
.
Anyway, me and my friend were in his living room just relaxing. Asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said sure it why not. He rolled us up a blunt and went to town. After about 7-8 hits I really started to feel it. Now I‚Äôm no expert on weed or anything so I don‚Äôt know what kind of weed we were smoking. After I started to feel the high coming on, he kept talking to me and asking me questions but I couldn‚Äôt speak lol. I wanted to talk to him but I couldn‚Äôt physically bring myself to say anything at all. Like there was tape over my mouth or something. After a few more hits I decided I was high enough and stopped. I looked around and everything felt like I was in a play? Like none of this was real in a sense? It felt like people were watching us on tv or me and my friend were acting out a play. It was really weird but really cool. I guess the whole ‚Äúwere all in a simulation‚Äù theory. Then ‚ÄúI Fall Apart‚Äù by Post Malone came on and I bust into tears thinking about my ex. Idk why I cried. I felt like a wimp so after I got done crying I laughed extremely hard at myself ahaha. I could not stop laughing. Then I eventually passed out and woke up the next morning. Interesting night for sure lmao",0

"Honestly? Weed keeps me going. I‚Äôm a minor, and i tried smoking for a month, and i really loved it. I decided to pretty much stop until im off to college, because the stress of getting caught outweighed how relaxed i was from the bud, and smoking while young isnt the best for your brain.

And the thought of being able to collect pieces, to collect lighters, to roll joints, to try different strains, to smoke with someone i love, to go outdoors while baked, its something that gives me hope. It‚Äôs less about being drug crazed, and more about i cant wait for the freedom and peace and joy to come with this medicine. Weed is just one aspect that keeps me hopeful for the future, as well as being able to have pets, have my own space, have my own privacy, and to be a little bit more free.

"Marijuana helps me master my disability. Alright. It‚Äôs summer, and I have been smoking pretty frequently since school ended. My school does drug tests, so I have three months out of every year to completely embellish myself in every drug known to man before I return and drug tests begin again in the fall.

My most significant observation is the incredible effect of weed on my ADD. 

For all that don‚Äôt know, ADD (also known as Attention Deficit Disorder) affects ones ability to pay attention to pretty much everything all the time, making memory is difficult to retain. I take medication for this disorder, and that helps me focus, but as soon as I hit my buddy‚Äôs dab pen, I drift out of reality. 

Upon entering the reefer‚Äôs paradise, my ADD symptoms triple in efficiency. I can‚Äôt pay attention to anything for more than 5 seconds. My memory sucks. I‚Äôm crazy lazy. I might as well be a vegetable. 

But I‚Äôve found that while I indulge in my high, I have the ability to tune anything I want out of my attention. I have literally mastered the art of my disability in that if someone is lecturing me or talking to me that I dislike, I can simply turn their volume off manually.

I need to know if other people have this ability or if I am the only one to experience this superpower.",0

I am a casual smoker. I tend to not finish my joint in 1 time and I tend to leave it for the next time. I have noticed that when i try to finish the joint the next day for example it is very hard to smoke it and it is nasty. It is as if I was smoking for the first time or something.

I believe this should not be very rare problem for people like me and I was wondering if this is normal or am I doing something wrong?

"Please help! My awful experience with weed... A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his friend. It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience...

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Here‚Äôs what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of the friend‚Äôs room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and his friend was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and unzipping their pants‚Äîin a sadistic, mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and his friend never did the pants stuff. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to the other guy, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions and we didn‚Äôt speak at all after the incident.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and remember the fear so deeply, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. I‚Äôve always felt very in control of my reality on drugs and never saw anything that wasn‚Äôt really happening. 

Is it possible that weed can make you hallucinate like this? Could they have given me a different drug? Other things that happened during this episode were that I saw lights flashing on and off and blinds opening and closing at a rapid pace...basically everything was sped up like in fast forward motion. It scared me so bad, I thought I was dying. 

Please help! I‚Äôve had so much trouble sleeping since then. I still have recurring dreams about being raped and have even started to question whether I was raped or sexually abused during my childhood and that‚Äôs why I had that reaction to the drugs, like maybe a suppressed memory or something. Or maybe there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me and I‚Äôm totally normal but they tricked me and accused me of hallucinating and now I‚Äôm starting to believe them... :(",0

"Interesting weed high. *Note: Sorry for bad grammar because a lot of things lol. I am using a phone, I don't speak English as a first language, and lastly I am kida high rn off a dab. 

So my co-worker and I got some really potent bud and rolled it as a joint and smoked the whole thing. It got me really messed up. Usually I can only get this high from like a 50mg edible but I guess the strain we smoked was really really strong so it had me and my co-worker blasted. Anyway he gets a call from his wife to pick her up from her work because her car isn't working, and he goes inside to get her while I stay in the car and move to the backend of the van where all our ladders and tools are and I have to sit on the floor. All of a sudden I see out of the side window my co-worker sprint to the car, and frantically opening the doors in the backend of the van and looking all scared and stuff at me. I shit my pants I suspected the cops somehow had followed us and because they smelled our joint and were now coming at us. He looked me dead in the eye, very very scared look on his face, and he said, ""Hey can I have my juice I think I left it back here... Oh there it is... Bye!"" Then he ran back. Two minutes later and he and his wife get back in and it was normal. We drive to the bank and I try to go in but end up going to wrong way and his wife is now laughing at me and pointing in the other direction (she knew I was baked). I went into the bank and went in line and stood there for 5 minutes waiting. I got super paranoid and thought every was looking at me becuase I look super high (my eyes are all red and squinted) and I then just turn around and leave the bank without doing anything with my money. We then go to his house for a minute. Now I don't drive my car to work, my co-worker picks me up from my house because it's faster. Anyway his wife offers me a ride home and I agree. It is then that we both have a super introspective and deep conversation all the way home. We both knew how stoned I was so we had a fun conversation about life, the world, the universe, cars, humankind, family stuff. Yeah and then she dropped me off at my house. That was 2 days ago.

I went to physical therapy for a few months and it got better. During that time I was taking a long break from weed.

"Brownies made with ground up weed This happened a few months ago but I think about it every once in awhile because it's really never happened before in my 10+ years of smoking..

I was at someones house and they asked if I wanted a brownie their friend had made. They swore they were super strong high quality. I took one and ate a bit and it tasted awful. They said their partner got so ripped on one and we should power through. I started inspecting the brownie and realized whoever made it literally just took ground up weed and tossed it in brownie batter. 

Eventually I just put it down and smoked a bowl but my sesh partner swore they felt really stoned and kept saying them doing things was because of the brownie. I felt zero effects other than the bowl I smoked.

I texted them the next day joking about how gross it tasted and they got offended and said them and their partner got super high so maybe it ""wasnt for me"". 

So - are people just throwing weed in their food? If you did, would you get ""super ripped""? I was always under the impression this didnt work unless the THC had a binding agent like the fats in butter. 

I dont even hang out with this person anymore but it was just weird at the time..",0

Now..

Due to medical reasons I explained the whole situation about weed to my gf and she said it was okay. Now I‚Äôm over here wanting to roll one up but idk how. Any suggestions? I‚Äôve tried the vape pens (there okay) and edibles (I get wayyy too high.).",0
The elevated one ,0
LSD resetting tolerance? So I‚Äôve heard from a few friends and online that after taking LSD that when they smoked after the trip it was like their tolerance had been reset I‚Äôm curious if anyone has had this happen to them because I‚Äôm thinking about trying LSD and that would be a cool side effect,0

Edit: Thanks for all the unhelpful tips to just smoke more. I was asking for your guy's ways you come down quicker, not get higher.",0

"My mom just ate my fucking edible. This is not a fucking drill!

So I was unpacking my thing in my room and I had my two weed cookies on top of my clothes in a Saran Wrap in my luggage so I had to take them out to get to my clothes. I put them on my bed and went to the bathroom. I‚Äôm such a fucking idiot. 

So she has this tendency to just eat people‚Äôs food is she sees it laying around which pisses off my dad and I. Like I didn‚Äôt think she would come in my room. I was freaking out when I heard her come in and was like ‚ÄúGosh did you have to bring home your whole closet?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to bring attention to the edibles since it was going to be suspicious so I just hoped she would notice it. 

Then I heard her say ‚ÄúAww you brought me cookies?‚Äù

And I was like ‚ÄúNo, sorry. They‚Äôre for me.‚Äù And she started getting offended for no reason and was like ‚ÄúYou always have to be so selfish.‚Äù and blah blah blah lol.

I didn‚Äôt want to press it to much because I didn‚Äôt want her to think something was up with them and I was worried. 

Now I‚Äôm fucking screwed. Im just going to pretend like I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with her when it kicks in. I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre medication is acting up again.‚Äù. But I‚Äôm kind of scared because she literally never smoked or consumed weed except for that so-called time in college but I doubt she inhaled lol.

She‚Äôs going to freaking the fuck out. 

I‚Äôm just mad that she ate that shit and now I only have one left to enjoy... I had a dream this shit would happen.

I‚Äôll update in like an hour.

I‚Äôm soooooo scared. She‚Äôs gonna be so fried. I only eat like a quarter and I smoke every day. Imagine her on a whole one and there was more than a gram in that cookie.... omfg. Fuck my life....

Update:

Okay so she‚Äôs literally normal. People keep asking what‚Äôs happening and... nothing is happening. I guess since she ate dinner it‚Äôs taking a while but I‚Äôm gonna say in the next 20 minutes she gonna feel it. I‚Äôve been just casually peaking downstairs to check in on her. I do not want to be around when it hits tbh but I know I have to be since my dad is gonna be so confused lmao.

Meanwhile I‚Äôm smoking a roach in my bathroom lmaooo. 

**UPDATE**

Yooooo. She‚Äôs tweakinnnn.

I‚Äôm just laying in bed and I hear ‚ÄúJesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Lawd have mercy! God help me!‚Äù 

Yoooo helppppo 

UPDATE

I‚Äôm laughing my fucking ass offffff I went downstairs and my dad is literally trying to hold her up bro. AHHHHHHH. Yo she‚Äôs gonee. She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúMe gettin heart palpations. Lawd help me.‚Äù‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 

Her eyes are red as shit oh my fuck

UPDATE

She‚Äôs find rn. She‚Äôs laying on the couch and quieted down. I think she‚Äôs going to just fall asleep. I gave her tea per her request and she not asking for food which is surprising. 

I‚Äôm playing Elvis music for her lmao and she‚Äôs loving it. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

UPDATE

She finally went up to her bed and let me help her up. Literally when her head hit that pillow she knocked the fuck out. 

We‚Äôre all going bed now. I don‚Äôt know what tomorrow will bring but yeah. Thanks for still around guys. I‚Äôll update tomorrow (today).

And also thanks for all the likes. This shit blew up lmaoo. 

UPDATE (NEXT MORNING 7:16 am)

I woke up early cause I just do that shit and my dad is up I think but I haven‚Äôt heard my mom. She‚Äôs usually up at like 6. 

I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs still tired from it but I‚Äôm getting up to check on her. I feel like like my dad is gonna be pissed. Then again he doesn‚Äôt really know about weed edibles or anything.

A lot of fucking people are saying that I poisoned my mom. I did not poison my mom. You‚Äôre insane for saying that. These are EDIBLES not fucking arsenic. She ate them herself after I told her not to. READ THE POST. She was just high as hell but mellowed out after like an hour and a half. My family and I calmed her down and made her comfortable and she went to bed close to 1 am. 

I would never poison my mom. So people accusing me of that are ridiculous. My mom is fine and alive.

Lastly, I‚Äôm tired of people assuming my race and gender lmao. Maybe the majority of the people in this subreddit are white males but I‚Äôm a Black female. Okay? Lol. I‚Äôm her daughter. 

My parents are Jamaican but no they‚Äôre not one of those ‚ÄúOne love. One heart. Let‚Äôs smoke together and feel alright.‚Äù type Jamaicans. So that‚Äôs why telling them about the edible is probably the worst thing to do. 

I‚Äôm not a terrible person. Accidents happen. I‚Äôm not the first person whose parent has eaten their edible. This is why you don‚Äôt eat people‚Äôs food after they tell you not to. Alright? Geez. (Now people are going to think I‚Äôm an asshole for saying that.)

UPDATE (7:50 AM)

My mom is finally awake and she looks GONE. Like her eyes are droopy. However she getting suspicious.

‚ÄúI think who ever made those cookies needs to learn to bake.‚Äù Baaaahh

No, because you got baked af last night... I‚Äôll stop. 

I don‚Äôt know how she still woke up early but I can tell she still feels it. She‚Äôs just confused and saying weird things. She‚Äôs also really uncoordinated and irritated. 

I‚Äôm debating if I should just tell her but I don‚Äôt want to give her a bad image of weed. The other day we were literally talking about the benefits of it and now she‚Äôs going to think it‚Äôs a terrible drug... know her she‚Äôll think they were laced with some hard drug like coke or something. 

She‚Äôll never forget this though...

UPDATE (9:13 AM)

BROOO MY FUCKING BROTHER. 

Okay so basically my brother started playing Broccoli by DRAM and my mom was like ‚ÄúWhy you have to play something so vulgar.‚Äù and my brother was like ‚ÄúMom, listen to the song. I think you can relate a little.‚Äù And she was still confused and I was trying to eye my brother like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell her!‚Äù

Then he fucking says ‚ÄúYou ate ate an edible.‚Äù

My mom: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an edible?‚Äù 

My brother: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like weed made into food and you ate a whole one last night.‚Äù

I hate this motherfucker brooooo.

She‚Äôs so pissed now. We had this whole ass argument while my brother thinks it‚Äôs funny.

This man stays getting me in trouble. Omfggggg. 

LAST UPDATE (11:56 AM)

So she‚Äôs sober now as far as I know. She‚Äôs still very pissed after finding out. I lied and said I threw the other one away (wondering why she didn‚Äôt ask for proof). 

Her exact words when my brother told her it was an edible we‚Äôre. ‚ÄúYa better be lyin‚Äô, ya see! If that cookie had drugs it- Jesus, Lawd...‚Äùüò©üç™

My brother: ‚ÄúIt just had weed.‚ÄùüòÜüçÅ

My mom: ‚ÄúPeople ah smoke weed an‚Äô demma eat deh something too? Mm mm. No. What if me was dead? Eh? Suppose me have a heart attack?‚Äùüò°üáØüá≤

Me: ‚ÄúNo one has died from weed.‚Äù üòÇ

My mom: ‚ÄúYou look here, likkle girl üëßüèΩ. Me nah listen to any of ya foolishness. Ya bring that somethin in me house again and you gon see what‚Äôs in store fah you!!‚Äù üò°üò°

Bruh. I had to write it exactly how she said it or else it isn‚Äôt as accurate nor funny. So she basically just yelled at me and threaten me. Lol. I honestly don‚Äôt give a fuck. üòàProbably gonna smoke in this house and bring weed cause ya girl needs her weed so. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

By the end of the day, she‚Äôll cool down and one day we‚Äôll all laugh about this. Don‚Äôt leave your freaking edibles out kids! Some of you White people are lucky. Your mom would probably be like ‚ÄúYou ought to not let this happen again, Christopher. You‚Äôre grounded for two days. This is a warning.‚Äù. Lol joking... don‚Äôt get offended lmao.

Alright, I‚Äôm done lol.

UPDATE (9:03 PM)

So I ate a quarter of the edible that was left and brooo. That shit kicked me in the ass in just 40 minutes. I‚Äôm so high.... I almost forgot to post this",0

Therefore, I have made a decision. Everytime I have money to buy cigarettes, I'll go out and buy some weed, because that'll finally get me to stop smoking these damn cigarettes.

My husband's grandmother who is 86 yrs old (very religious  and law abiding but lives in an illegal state) has had bone spurs that have kept her in bed alot. She was on oxycodone for years at a high dose and went through full withdrawal when her insurance stopped covering. DESPERATE for relief. 
She finally said she wanted edibles and I live in a legal state so a family member came to visit and brought her back some, thinking it might not work.  WELL, she ate one and is walking around without her walker, eating sandwiches and laughing at the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" as I type this.
I am over the moon for her.",0

Lately I've been eating gouda for the past 2 days and I not only had dreams (cause I usually don't) but they were unusually vivid.

"Your opinion on letting cheese expire In another thread, u/kagemichaels mentions [that he lets Limburger expire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/bzl26p/if_you_could_only_eat_3_types_of_cheese_for_the/eqwlnrr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and that resonated with me since I tend to do the same thing with Limburger and other sort or semi-soft cheeses like Camembert or √âpoisses. The result is almost always amazing, the cheeses usually gain a ton of flavor, intensity and develop a sharpness the would never have had at their expiration date. 

Unfortunately, the result sometimes looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/nuv1bQ8.jpg) or even far worse, with a sunken rind or covered with tiny white freckles. Also some of these cheeses smell so strong that my wife demands that I repeatedly check if they are still edible.

Just to make that clear: I can tell an edible cheese from a spoiled one and make sure to always stay on the safe side.

"[unpopular opinion?] Baguette and fresh bread &gt; crackers Lately i've been observing all these ""charcuterie boards"" and im kind of confused as to why every single one of you puts crackers on the side instead of freshly baked goods. Is this just some trend in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing better than a crisp baguette with a soft core to accompany my cheese.

Crackers are too salty and don't offer the complexity in taste and structure I deem ""delicious"".

Whole grain crackers aside, they're unhealty.

&amp;#x200B;

Change my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw.: It's so damn easy to bake your own baguette. You even get to choose your prefered state of ""burned"" and the melting butter on top is something that let's me moan every time. Fuck crackers. :)",1

"Camembert - is it supposed to taste like that? I realize this is a lost cause as it's impossible to describe a taste properly, but: I bought some camembert two days ago because I always believe I'll love fancy cheeses and I'm always disappointed.   
But how is camembert supposed to taste? I've heard it tastes nutty and fruity. But all I tasted was this weird fermented taste, like something rotten, like fruit that has gone bad or orange juice that has gone off with a hint of ""regular"" cheese as an after-taste. I always imagined brie or camembert tasting like ""regular"" yellow cheese but more intense with strong overtones of spices...   
So, is that what camembert tastes like and what kind of cheese should I try if I wanna try a cheese that is more like cheese but stronger and more intense flavour?   


This post might have been a mistake as taste is too subjective, but if you can figure out what I mean, please contribute :)",1

"the worlds most delicious cheddar so I purchased recently this cheese from snowdonia because it was aesthetic as fuck on the grocery shelf.

https://www.snowdoniacheese.co.uk/cheese/black-bomber/

and i gotta say served by itself its unbelievable tasty, with a very unique taste with lots of little crunchy bits.

But one of my favourite snacks is to cook a paratha or a roti that i usually get frozen from my grocery store on a low heat until it starts bubbling and cut some pieces of cheese on it while its cooking and flip it over and kinda eat it like a makeshift grilled cheese.

my god i can not explain this fucking heavenly flavour.  this is hands down the most unique tasting thing ive ever tasted when its melted.  It's flavour profile completely changes and honestly this thing was worth every penny (8 CAD for 200grams).

That's all I want to say.",1

"Did they change Tillamook cheddar? Sorry if this is a weird post for this sub, didn't know where better to put it.

I've been getting Tillamook medium cheddar (pre-sliced) at Costco for something like 3-5ish years and it's been my favorite for something that's tasty, easy and not too pricey.

The last package I got though, the packaging was different. I figured it wouldn't really matter, right? I just made a couple quesadillas with it, though, and it's no longer the delicious gooeyness it has been. It smelled unusually strongly when I opened the package, the slices crumbled really easily, and after cooking the taste is kinda weird and the texture is just completely wrong, it's all curdley.

Did I just get a dud package or did they change their recipe or something? I recently tried Tillamook ice cream for the first time and had no complaints with that, so I didn't think they did anything weird, but this is the first time since long ago when I tried another brand's American that I put some cheese into my mouth and actually thought ""gross""

If it helps, I had just by happenstance not bought any more cheese for a while recently. I think the last time I got a package before this one was probably somewhere 3-6 months ago?",1

The only problem? I've never seen it anywhere outside of S√ºdtirol, and I don't live there anymore. I am living Stateside for the foreseeable future, and I'd really like to think that I won't have to fly to Europe every time I want to eat it.

Do any of yall cheese connoisseurs know where I can order some Grauk√§se in the USA? My initial searches have yielded only hits for sellers in Europe, and instead of paying $70 on shipping, I'd rather just buy more cheese.

"How long can you keep a cut wheel of cheese? My fiance (originally from Switzerland) and I (British) love cheese and are thinking about getting a cheese wedding cake. The bottom 'tier' would be a 5-7kg full wheel of Swiss cheese, so similar in texture to Gruyere or Appenzeller but obviously much smaller than a Gruyere! (Marechal is our favourite but we're considering a few options.) Next tier up is likely to be Stilton or Stichelton.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the expected number of guests at our wedding and the expected total weight of the cheese wheels we will be ordering, there would probably be 2-3kg leftover from the wheel of Swiss cheese, and maybe 1kg leftover Stilton. If we take all the leftover cheese home with us, how long will the two different cheeses last in the fridge if wrapped in cheese paper?",1

Anyway, I rush home in excitement unwrap it from the plastic, pour some nuts, fruits, and champagne. All the things people say to eat it with. I took that first bite and it literally tasted like semen. Cold, goopy, semen. I didn't know I had to let it sit for 30 minutes and get room temperature. Today after work I let it sit and adjust.

I love cheese, and have gotten my boyfriend to try a lot of new types.

I've tried to see if there is anything like a soft sharp cheddar, but they all seem to be cheese dips or spreads, rather than actual soft cheese. Maybe I'm just not that good at looking, so I'm sorry if this is something really obvious.

Giving up milk was easy (since that affects me the worst), I replaced it with lactaid milk which I have no problem with. Butter was fairly easy too since there are vegetable based butters. BUT THERES NOTHING THAT CAN FILL THE VOID OF CHEESE!

SO my question, is there any lactose free cheeses? Anything similar enough to get me by? Idk if I‚Äôm even posting in the right subreddit but I‚Äôm honestly desperate. I feel so sick and tired every day because I‚Äôm also a night eater, and my go-to is cheese.",1

"Morbier: To rind, or not to rind? I had some (delicious) Morbier the other day from a restaurant on a cheese plate. It was already sliced up into small pieces, and the rind was still intact on either end of the piece. In fact, the rind was quite delicious: Lightly crunchy from the crystallization with a bit of funk and salt. Really complemented the meat of the cheese well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I bought a big slice of Morbier from the cheese shop the other day and I noticed something different. The rind near the ""back"" edge of the cheese (that is, where the outer edge of the wheel would be, basically) was extremely hard. Like hard enough that I'd just assume it was not edible.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, as you move towards the tip of the slice (what would be the center of a wheel), the rind gets noticeably softer. There's basically a gradient along the slice where it goes from incredibly hard to reasonably soft. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question: Do you just eat the rind up to the point where it becomes unpleasantly hard for your personal taste? That would be my assumption, I guess, but I wanted to get other people's opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question: I always thought Morbier was a washed rind cheese. But if that's the case, how could the rind of this slice I bought be so hard at the back? Has my assumption that all washed rind cheeses have \*soft\* rinds been wrong all along? Can washed rinds be hard??",1

While the texture is really nice, its def different than cheaper fetas ive bought. Is this normal for sheep milk cheese?

"Colby?? I came here after finding a short thread about someone looking for Colby a few years ago.  I'm currently trying to find it myself.  What's going on with it?  Is there suddenly some prejudice against it or is it not being made anymore?  For at least 40 years in Colorado I've been able to get it easily in the deli and the cheese section (slices, sticks, blocks, organic, non organic), and I did every time I went to the store.  It's been a favorite snack cheese all my life.  Suddenly, about a month ago, every store in my area (King Soopers, Safeway, Albertsons and Walmart) stopped carrying it.  All forms and brands gone.  Poof.  The only way it exists anymore is mixed up with the overpowering flavor of jack which I can't stand.  I saw, in that old thread, people saying that Colby is sharp, but it's about as mild as you can get and still have flavor.  I saw other people saying it's just like mild cheddar, but it's not.  It's not nearly as fatty or greasy as cheddar and it's more delicate in flavor.  This is what makes it a wonderful snacking cheese.  King Soopers even has a special cheese section that has cheeses from all over the world (many so specialized you've never heard of them) and super expensive ($5 or more for a bite sized square).  What happened to good Wisconsin Colby?  How can we get stores to carry it again?",1

It's made from Sheep's milk, and it says on the website it's ""Made in the traditional Dutch Gouda style,"" but this tastes nothing like any Gouda I've had before, so I'm hesitant to tell people it's ""Gouda"" because this is very different.

"Cheese vehicles besides crackers &amp; bread? I love cheese. And cheese on crackers, bread, biscuits, etc., has been one of my go-to snacks for years.

Of course cheese is delicious on its own. Of course it is. And I often will slice off a chunk of cheese and eat it solo.

"Flamb√© + Wheel ‚Äî Advice needed Anyone ever had the Bucatini all'Amatriciana flamb√® at Trattoria Vecchia Roma in Rome? This place and dish needs to be on the bucket list of any cheese fanatic.  It‚Äôs bucatini pasta in a red sauce with guanciale that is tossed into a wheel of pecorino that has been doused in alcohol and set afire.  The melted cheese gets mixed in with the pasta, and it‚Äôs quite possibly the greatest meal in the world.  My buddy, who is a fantastic amateur cook, keeps talking about flying back to Rome just to eat at that restaurant.  

Here‚Äôs where I need your help. He has basically reverse-engineered the dish that it tastes very, very close to what we hadn‚Äôt in Rome.  He wants to take it a step further and get the wheel of pecorino.  Costco sells a 50-pound wheel for $330.  It‚Äôs not the best pecorino, but it‚Äôs good enough.   I think what he‚Äôs looking to do is to host dinner parties for friends.  The flamb√© is something that is rarely if ever seen in the US, so it would be quite unique.  Get a few friends to chip in, and you‚Äôve got a bunch of dinners in 2019.   

Let‚Äôs set aside how bad of an idea this could be.  It‚Äôs only $330, so that‚Äôs not going to bankrupt anyone.  Cheese will assuredly get wasted, but chunks can be given away to attendees.  Where I need your expertise is what steps you would take to ensure this could reasonably work.  

Here are my thoughts as to what we need:

1) Hired help to start the wheel.  I think we need to pay the guy at the local cheese shop to chizzle out the top of this thing to start it so it‚Äôs able to be a bowl for pasta to be dumped into.  

2) Freezer/vacuum bag for the wheel.  After each meal, put it in the vacuum bag and freeze it.  Pull it out a day or two in advance of the next meal. Repeat as needed. 

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve come up with.  Any constructive guidance, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  I‚Äôve noticed experts and aficionados on this sub, and your tips could go a long way to making sure this concept isn‚Äôt a complete disaster.

"One of my favorite Italian cheeses: Gorgonzola! Gorgonzola is a blue [Italian cheese](https://www.gianlucatognon.com/indulging-in-italian-cheese/) produced from pasteurized whole cow‚Äôs milk with the addition of enzymes and selected moulds. It was first made in the town of Gorgonzola, in the north of Italy, at the end of the 10th century.

There are two types of Gorgonzola, sweet and savory. I like the first which is a mix of creamy and more solid parts. According to the legend, this mix of two parts of different consistency came from the fact that a young dairyman, lingering with his girlfriend, failed to complete the work of the day, postponing it to the following day. By mixing the curd of the evening with the one of the morning, he inadvertently managed to create a cheese which had never been produced before.

"Attempting to find ""American Style"" cheddar in Europe BIG DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT MEAN THE PROCESSED CHEESE PRODUCT. American style is in quotes because I don't know the correct term

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm an American that has moved to Europe. The cheese scene is excellent but I have been craving a nice sharp cheddar. Problem is the British Style sharp cheddars don't seem to match what I expect from a sharp cheddar. The cheddar I'm looking for could be described as sour, but I've been stopping at several cheesemongers where I live and the best they can do with that description is ""well we have some really fresh goat cheese"" (delicious but not cheddar). Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Am I missing some critical term or searching in the wrong places?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills since the information I can find online doesn't seem to mention this difference at all. I'd almost suspect I'm talking about the fake cheese except for that I remember clearly loving a cheddar I got from a local cheese maker in the US with that exact sour flavor. I hope my cheddar memories aren't a lie

Is it really because they do not use the cow species fed by grass only from a certain area of Italy?  I have a doubt, because the taste is just about the same to my palate.

Does this parmesan have the same wheel breaking process as real Parmigiano-Reggiano?  Looking at its texture, I doubt it.

"What is this cheese?! Please help! üßÄüò¢ The context is that I told the people in charge of a charcuterie board situation at work to get cheese from two different places - 1. A supermarket in Toronto 2. A local deli/cheese/butcher shop, so this cheese could be from either place. On the night of said party, people were all leaving and we decided to just cut chunks of cheese from the boards and take them home as they'd just sit around over the weekend. I took a chunk of manchego and then spotted this guy and took a chunk off too.

The clues:

1. I know it said Castello and 'mild' on the rind of the wedge. Bear in mind, it was a wedge and not a block. It also was not a Castello mild blue cheese, trust me, I looked.
2. It had a light blue Castello motif but the chunk I cut off has neither of these marks. Was I imagining all of this? Let's hope not.
3. The cheese itself is white, but around the interior layer of the rind, it yellows a bit.
4. Very strong savoury taste, almost like cheddar but I don't think it's that..
5. Texture wise - it's not soft like a brie, a blue, a gorgonzola or a mature cheese like a parmesan. It's a little creamier than an aged cheddar I'd say, and has more white than yellow colour wise. Perhaps a goat's cheese? It reminds me a little of a less mature version of an Ontarian bandaged goat's cheese cheddar I've had before.
6. White wax rind, but with another layer below of ridged... rind..? I don't know what it is.
7. Last thing - Castello makes a ton of packaged blue cheeses. This was not packaged in that manner, it was definitely a wedge taken from a wheel and re-sold. The thing that's throwing me is that I can't find any other Castello cheeses with their logo printed on the actual outside of the wheel, sort of in the Louis Vuitton fashion.
8. I have googled 'white waxed Castello cheese' 'white mild Castello cheese' and 'Castello white wax blue logo cheese that's also white inside but has another layer and also tastes very nice' and can Google no more.
9. These sad photos of the cheese chunk may offer some more hints. I don't know.

Aaaaaagh.

However, when I unwrap the Camembert wheel it 1) is spotted with small brown spots on the rind instead of a smooth whitish color, and 2) smells unusual, like a faint ammonia aroma. I cut about a third of the wheel off and it's runny and bright yellow so I figure it's good. But the taste is off, like a stale salty taste is the best I can describe it.

I just bought it today so I thought wow that's odd. Then I check the best buy date and it says 1/29/19. Would this still be considered ok to eat and serve to a dinner guest? What would you do?",1

"Need a name for a type of cheese Back where I'm from, you could get a kind of farmer's market kind of cheese that I love, but I would not have any idea how to ask for it, or look for it in the U.S.I assume it's not available for purchase in chain stores, since it's a fresh kind of cheese.

My best description of it is:

1.  It's a white cheese.
2.  It's tender, in between squishy and solid block cheese.
3. Creamy.
4. You buy it in blocks.
5. When you slice, your knife will have some of the creamy texture on it afterward.
6. Very slightly salty.
7. Nice slightly sour taste that stays in your mouth (the sourness is not as much as yogurt).
8. It does not have a strong smell.
9. It's not brittle (a given since it's fresh and creamy).
10. Not full of holes.

I got it a week ago and have been keeping it at room temp, but should I move it to the fridge and keep it there until I leave in April?

Also: the goat cheese isn‚Äôt standard texture of goat cheese, it‚Äôs harder almost like chedder(maybe a little softer) but melts into your mouth

"""Did you seize the cheese?"" I woke to the sound of front door being slammed closed this morning at 2:20am. Still half asleep, I went to my kitchen and discovered the window wide open, and the screen gone. All the items from my window sill were mysteriously placed outside on the deck. The discovery was especially terrifying to the girl who happened to be spending the night at my house.

I started assessing what belongings the greasy thief could have grabbed. My ASUS Ultrabook was on the counter directly next to the scene of the crime. My work room full of laptops, desktops, and shelves of computer parts for my small business were seemingly untouched. My watch, car keys, television, consoles and other items were not disturbed either.

I phoned the incident into the local town police, who arrived around 3:00am. The officer questioned me about what could be missing, ""This may seem weird, but would you check if anything is missing from your refrigerator?"". All the major items were also undisturbed. At a second glance I realized my 24 pack of Kraft Singles processed cheese slices were missing. The office than spoke into his radio, ""Did you seize the cheese?"". A forensic investigation followed, searching for footprints, fingerprints, while capturing pictures and statements.

Another call was made to police a few houses down, shortly after my incident, reported an intoxicated man walking down the street. When police caught up to him, they seized my individually wrapped cheese slices from him. I never expected something like this to happen in my small Canadian town.",1

"Worst Weed (?) Experience I've Ever Witnessed In My Entire Life Ok, so before we start. I smoked the exact same weed as my brother, admittedly not as much and out of a different bong (the one he uses is huge and pretty dirty). My brother is 17 and super thin.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; This is difficult to shorten but essentially my brother takes a huge hit of weed and then thinks he's dying/ hearing voices. Parent's say its a panic attack but it doesn't make sense based on how the ""panic attack"" presented: HUGE wide open eyes, terrified and angry, switching between calm and scared, not being able to see/ seeing double, and saying he's hearing voices. He hasn't woken up yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

At like 9pm, I go into my brother's room and smoke a bowl. I leave and let him enjoy whatever weed was left in the grinder and bowl with his friend. I see at 11 pm he takes a HUGE hit that he posts on his snap story. Completely milky 2 foot bong rip. He's told me that his tolerance has been really high and that he needs like 3 bowls to get high so I think nothing of it.

&amp;#x200B;

At 11:30 I get a knock on my door and our parents call me into their room. My brother is FREAKING OUT. His eyes are WIDE OPEN. I'm telling you I've never seen someone's eyes open that wide-- especially if they were just smoking. He's telling them that he's dying and it seems like he is seeing double or can't see or something because he keeps reaching out to hold my hand/ grab my mom and he's missing. We kept asking if he was seeing anything but he said he didn't have any visual hallucinations. He claims he didn't take anything else and I believe him because he comes to me with anything drug related BEFORE he takes it and whenever there is a problem. Immediately I go into his room and asked his friend what happened-- if he took anything. His friend says that he didn't just took a huge bong rip, threw up, and then got 2 inches from his face and started screaming about how he was dying.

&amp;#x200B;

I search the room for drugs or anything weird. Everything's fine. I go back to my parent's room. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's standing on the bed, screaming that he's dying, and my parents are trying to make him sit. He says he hears voices and that he's seen the future????  He's not making any sense at all. He looks terrified, and then suddenly switches to angry and he's waving his arms everywhere. He switches back and forth between these two emotions for a bit. Then, he starts drifting off to sleep and waking up every now and then. Each time he wakes up, he gets scared again-- sits up really fast and starts screaming about how he's dying and goes back to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parent's say it was just the weed and a panic attack. But I've never seen someone react this way before and my brother smokes ALL THE TIME. I've seen him so high he can barely move or keep a conversation. I don't understand why he wouldn't be able to handle that. Plus if people green out, usually they don't move as much as he did/ aren't as amped up as he was. AND his tolerance was so high- he took one hit albeit a huge one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus-- if it was a panic attack, wouldn't it stop as soon as he was calm enough to go to sleep? If we was coming to and immediately sitting up/ freaking out/ getting scared again, that doesn't sound like a panic attack right? It's like he was scared of something he saw/ was with him. He would be calm and then look at me or random objects and literally flip out again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know...

&amp;#x200B;

He's still sleeping now- 12 hours later so I don't have his perspective of it yet/ I don't know how he will be feeling when he wakes up.

&amp;#x200B;

"Do you ever cough up nasty shit? (Answer will not help if you are also a cig smoker or heavy vaper) The only thing I smoke nowadays is weed since I've finally been able to boot cigs and vaping out of my life.  

For the past week I've been coughing up some grey phlegm.  I've been smoking weed for 6 years and this has never been a problem until now (besides when I picked up nicotine, but that was because of the cigs/vape obviously.)

I think it's because the buds I have right now are not trimmed well (perhaps not trimmed at all.)  It's relatively good weed, but I think that I'm coughing this nasty shit because of the excessive leaves on the buds.

Anyone ever deal with this?  Or been able to confirm that it was because of shitty weed/smoking the leaves?

Maybe my body just needs a break, but I do not feel mentally prepared for that.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm quite dependent on cannabis.

"Weed coffee has me hallucinating (warning!) So I'm a bit hallucinatey right now off some weed coffee i made out of my abv. I went out to smoke a j since its 420 am and i started seeing shadows all around moving and i got paranoid as fuck and scared. I swear i saw an alien in the corner of my garden but i checked and I'm clearly hallucinating. I'm inside now so I'm fine it's more like I'm just anxious now i guess. Couple details i have to add:

1. I haven't slept all night because i drank too much diet soda near bed time.
2. The coffee was my first in three days so it hit me
3. I Smoked A cbd joint with Honolulu haze and cherry bud
4. The coffee was made with abv that included thc bud (tiny amount but it was On top so I'm sure it's in there) and mostly cbd hemp flower. Mostly the cherry strain.
5. I have mental illness (mmj patient)

Apparently the mix of coffee and high cbd made me double ""up"", or ""peaking"", as cbd has a caffeine effect and I'm tripping because of the massive load of endorphins. 

Attn: drug addicts; this shit has me feeling like meth and acid!!! So go for it if your trying to be high lol

Attn: people trying to be healthy and sane; don't mix coffee with hella cbd. Gives a psychosis feeling, possibly only to those with history of mental illness or currently mentally ill

I doubt there was any thc in it it probably turned into cbn because i microwaved it after Vaping it. I'm possibly feeling the radiation, who knows? Afterwards i realized i should not be so lazy and microwave the water alone and then add abv..but I'm gonna continue being lazy that's just for you folks being careful

Anyways at first i got a hella happy feeling and then a body high and then i felt stoned like normal I'm not really noticing the caffeine from the coffee but I'm chill af just gotta stay in light or my mind plays tricks on me. Feeling super happy tho lol. Like if your depressed or have major depression problems this might help but not if you have anxiety

Not really a question more of a psa. i know they make weed coffee but not this strong lol.

Weed newbie So i just started smoking about two months ago. Every time i smoke i have different ‚Äúhighs‚Äù even with the same weed. Some times i don‚Äôt feel much at all. Then sometimes it makes me feel pretty sick. I get very dizzy and feel like throwing up. Is this just because i smoked too much? Edibles don‚Äôt seem to do much except make me super spaced out and like time goes by in like a snapshot feeling. Other than that i don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù Only a few times have i had the really nice euphoric feeling. Iv tried smoking the actual flower and edibles but mainly i use a vape pen. Why does my experience vary so wildly even with the same weed?,0

When I was a young kid in high school I‚Äôve never abused anybody like physically or tried to ruin their life in any form, but I‚Äôve made fun of them. I feel like i tried to be the class clown and make others laugh on the cost of others to seem funny and interesting to people. The moment I‚Äôve read the definition of the word class clown was one of the most important moments of my life. Meanwhile I‚Äôm always trying to be the best person I can be and try to make the people feel good and confident as much as I can if I see them somewhere randomly. That‚Äôs not about fishing for apology at all, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm sure you can improve yourself and do good whenever you can and should. Love yall",0

"Getting too high of of little weed Hey guys, this is my first post on this sub and on Reddit. I have been smoking everyday at night for about half a year now. The problem I'm having is that I get extremely high off of little weed and I don't seem to get the same effects as other people discribe. I was wondering what I could possibly do to reduce the effects or start to feel it the same way other people do. Any help would be appreciated:)",0

"There is only one level of high... I've been smoking eleven years and I've literally never experienced ""more high"" ""extreme high"" or ""double triple antant high"" lmao and i have had some of the fattest sessions. Had 30-50 gram joint to the head once alone. Same high as one gram joint next day with the same weed

There is one level. There is half a level and less than that but you can't go past high...or get double the effect of maximum. So smoking past your point is a waste and clearly all gimmick. Like people taking one gram dabs and being like I'm on a scale of 1-10 a 13. I get it. It's funny. entertainment wooo! But some people are serious about that lol

I get tolerance but why push it? I once told a stoner girl that how much do you smoke til you feel it. She was like two hits everytime. i was like me too let's bone!! No i was like then why smoke more. She was like cuz i get higher.

I'm clearly stoned right now but i always smoke the same amount. This time i smoked double....same high....lasting just as long. I do it for the fun of smoking and the taste not to get an imaginary double high lol

I used to joke tho that each joint ascended me to a new level of high like I'm a super saiyan reaching super saiyan 2 or even 3. For those of you that don't get my dbz reference....screw you i ain't explaining hahaha

Anywho. I want to hear thoughts on this.

Do you think weed is infinitely increasing in effects or do you agree with me. I mean unless you are not smoking enough...you get it..i hope i Friggin forgot my point....

Let's roll another one!
I'm not saying everyone stop wasting weed. There's clearly enough to go around. But let the delusion end!",0

"Probably the 100th post.. But Can anyone tell me the difference between indica and sativa? I know there are so many threads and posts on this but none have really answered some things for me. For example how come when I smoke indica I never visually see anything different but my body is tingling and feels heavy in a good ass way? I also feel mellow and great. But when I smoke sativa I get paranoid and see my vision shift and see differently as if objects or people just turned 4D if that makes any sense. Honestly for me, Sativa doesn't make any sense for me to smoke, my mind is a bit hyperactive so it just makes me feel aware of myself, surroundings, and just about anything all the time.

i want to take my pen with me because obviously it makes my anxiety more manageable and college is stressful as hell. i‚Äôve tried smoking, but my lungs hate the smoke. and edibles are way to hard to find and way more expensive than my vape. so the pen it is. 

so my question is‚Äîhow tf do i hide it? should i keep it in my mattress? in a cabinet? in a mini safe? in my car? in my backpack?

That all said, I recently got a job at a processing plant in town and they have me trimming the buds to prepare them for packaging. I, wanting to be a perfectionist, have my face as close to the bud as possible to make sure I get every leaf off. The smell on the buds as I cut them has been becoming stronger and stronger as we get new and heavier strains. This is day three and I feel different than usual. My brain is wandering more, I'm incredibly hungry, and I'm more relaxed than my usual self despite being super nervous about this job. I know you can get a little high from marijuana smoke but can cutting buds at a close proximity also give you a mild high?",0

"Thc OVERLOAD? My name is irrelevant here lol but Call me Joseph! I'm in search of answers and also people who have been feeling the same way.  I've been toking regularly with heavy blunt use for about 7 years now. In January 2019 I was smoking like usual until things took an odd turn one day. My neck started feeling weird as if something bad was going to happen, it's definitely THC related because CBD doesn't do this to me. After that day I noticed when I smoke my neck has this really uncomfortable feeling to it as if something bad is going to happen my blood pressure and heart rate go up and I have to hold my arm behind it to stabilize it. I know weird right? I've tried so many supplements and other methods but nothing seems to make it go away when I smoke accept for time. It lasts about 20-45 minutes its kinda scary and in the moment feels like bad things will happen. It occurs after light usage not even heavy smoking. Im not sure if its because I have wayyy way to much THC circulating in my body or what. I just wanna smoke peacefully and comfortably like I used to. Has anyone else who has been smoking awhile or period felt adverse symptoms such as these please hit me up so we can solve this. My only best guess is detoxification and laying off doe a month. Or so. In the last 3 months I've probably only smoked half ounce if that usually I would smoke anywhere from an G to 14gs blunt after blunt kinda thing when I had it like that. Before it was just when I smoked blunts. Smoking Bowls/hitters I was just fine until these last 2 months recently.",0

"I quit Vaping I quit Vaping and went back to smoking because no matter what form of Vaping i was doing it made me gag and cough. I even have a volcano so it isn't my device. Tried e juice, nope. Distillate, nope. And several crappy versions that are worse than smoking like Mct oil carts. Once got coconut oil when they claimed it was wax cartridge. 

Anything i try only tastes good for a second then I'm coughing a lung. And that burnt popcorn or beans taste is awful. Abv edibles taste terrible too.

I think it's unhealthy in comparison to smoking especially e juice and distillate, not enough research to say it's healthier especially with Vaping flavors and terpenes which in my experience terpenes burn easy and i mean bad burn. And Vaping dry herb feels like water vapor instead of actual cannabinoids

Smoking gets it all into you and Vaping gets you some then you have abv....it's a shame i wanted it to work. i actually use more herb Vaping then smoking and i get less high Vaping

Anyone else feel this way? 

I'm tired of coughing and getting barely high. I smoke a joint and I'm good for at least 2-3 hours but when i vape I'm like itching for relief within half an hour. By my math i can smoke .5 in five minutes and vape it in an hour. So clearly Vaping is not efficient.

I know I'm not doing it wrong because I've tried several devices and methods over five years. I'm finally done trying lol. Smoking tastes and feels better plus is faster.",0

"Concentrate inside or outside a joint? Which do you prefer? So I'm stoned and I'm contemplating dank joints and how they are made.

I was wondering what people think is the best method to roll a joint with concentrate (kief, wax, shatter, etc), inside the joint or outside, and why?

To answer my own question i feel like it's a waste to put concentrate on the outside because your smoking what's inside the joint not outside. I mean like I've rolled em that way and i never feel i get the full effect like when it's rolled inside. Sure it looks pretty outside and you can make art out of it but it's only gonna burn off and not really get in you. I'm sure some will but it's not efficient. Maybe it's better for sharing or hot boxing because it gets everywhere lol unlike when it's inside it kinda would go into one person in one fat rip and everyone else wouldn't get any. I've experienced this with friends.

So i like it inside (that's what she said!) Cuz i usually smoke alone and don't hot box anymore.

"Developing discipline/moderation? I‚Äôve never had moderation with drugs or alcohol or anything else. Now that I‚Äôve been sober for 3 years I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I can actually do things in moderation if I just try.

One thing I realized from coffee is that I‚Äôll quit for months or even years and one day decide to go back and automatically start drinking it every day even multiple times.

Yesterday I drank a latte after 4 months off. I told myself I would have a latte once every two weeks from now on, and if I can do that for a year and it gets easier, then after a year I will try drinking alcohol or smoking weed once every 2-3 weeks.

I kind of wanted coffee again today but didn‚Äôt, and this is probably my first time going back to something and not having it again the next day so it‚Äôs already a big thing for me. I‚Äôm realizing that if I just set the goal I can actually do it.

My hope is that since I have 3 years off of weed and alcohol, I will be less dependent on it if I go back. Like I‚Äôll be able to take it or leave it.

Do you think I can compare coffee to alcohol and weed, or will they be much more powerful in that I won‚Äôt be able to go the next day without it?",0

"weed made me hate my date and myself      i met up with this guy who ive been secretly talking to for the last few months for the second time yesterday. we both had our first kiss together the first time we met up. i really do think i loved him. and its crazy because i talk about it like it all happened years ago and it didnt. yesterday we met up again a second time and got high and all of a sudden i just started hating him for no reason. i didnt want him near me, i didnt want his arm around me or him close to my face. 
      i ended up feeling so bad that i ended our little date thing early because we just were sorta sitting in a little opening in a forest in complete silence. honestly it was a really scary high. i was paranoid and upset that i couldnt figure our why i was feeling so apathetic towards him, and then i started thinking about how i dont love anything, that i just might not be able to be chained down by a person or a relationship, and that i was meant to be free and a loner that would just live to have lots of experiences and stories to tell. 
     i understand that might not seem like a bad thing but it completely goes against everything i thought i wanted, and its like this dark cloud looming over me telling me i should just be alone. ive tried talking to him about just these complex and weird emotions ive been having the last two days and he just doesnt really seem to care about how i feel, albeit, hes also been insanely high himself. he usually gets like this while high.
    the thing is, this high was really weird for me though, not like what i usually feel and i havent quite experienced anything like it before so its just making it really hard to understand how much of it was something i should worry about and how much i should just shrug off and blame the weed on. 
     i just felt so disappointed in myself. like i kept getting these flashbacks to distant memories from my childhood i thought id forgotten and i would think about everything i thought i would be when i was my age now and what i thought i was going to be like as a child is nothing like how ive turned out. i feel like an embarrassment and that i ruin everybody.",0

"Crazy visuals after smoking for the first time right so I was with a few friends heading to a park to smoke, I remember only having a few puffs and then after about 20 minutes everything started to look cartoon-ish, 2D or very blurry and just weird in general is the best way I can describe it, it looked so surreal and I couldn't properly focus my eyes on anything, it got progressively worse throughout the high, everything was lagging its like my brain was overloaded and was only able to take snapshots of what was happening a few seconds prior. Also I remember just looking at my boyfriend and zoning out completely and tripping balls and then I came back to reality. It felt like I was tripping for 10 minutes but it was actually just two seconds. I dont know if this makes much sense but has anything similar to this happened to any of you?",0

"Still feel weird 3 days after smoking Hey everyone! 
Decided to ask here before totally freaking out and going to the doctor. I smoked from a bong about 3 days ago and am still feeling numbness in my body and a general feeling of disconnection, floatiness and brain fog. I feel sort of ""out of it"" and not like myself. 

Some background info: I've only smoked a couple of times before. When I smoke after drinking I experience memory loss for the period after the weed kicks in. I also had a severe panic attack the first time I had edibles(there was way too much in them obviously) where I was tripping balls and thought I was dying(ended up calling 911). Now leading up to this moment, I've smoked like 3 times within a week. 2 of those times were a bad experience(though not as bad as the edibles experience) and I got close to having a full-blown panic attack when I smoked from the bong 3 days ago. 

My question is whether this is something I should see a doctor for or if I should wait longer for these symptoms to go away on their own?",0

"Worst high of my life so far. Iv been smoking some what regularly for a little over a year now . earlier today I smoked like I usually do, the usual amount. at first I was having fun I made myself a late breakfast and watched some youtube videos I was having a good time. At like the 45 min mark I was having a horrible time. my mind kept racing I couldn't concentrate on one thing. So as my mind kept thinking my thoughts really got out of control. I didn't feel like myself. I felt as if everything I had ever known even myself was complexity fabricated. Nothing seemed real in the slightest bit and I was having a hard time coming to terms with it.  That was the worst part of my experience this time I couldn't understand why life was real, or who I was, nothing in the world we lived in made sense. I thought maybe I was too high and watched a video and everything the lady said in the video made it worse. So its a little while later and I decide to go my room so I could sleep it off. I just wanted it to be over. But then I couldn't get comfortable what so ever. eventually I did after I freaked out some more. I turned on some music and fell asleep. when found some songs that didn't provoke my mind to think about any and everything. I was wondering has this happened to anybody else? is this common? is there a name for it ?",0

In the past couple of weeks, however I've found I've been paranoid to the point I've believed that I've been followed by multiple people and that they're all connected and following me. 

I know this is obviously stupid and the logic in my brain tries to overrule it but it just doesn't happen. Even when I'm alone I'll sit and worry myself into a stupid hole.

I'll wait it out and an hour or so later the CBD kicks in and I'm all good, chillin n everything. I'm just wondering if anyone has an understanding of what I'm dealing with, whether it's my own problem that is amplified by smoking or whether I should cut weed out for a bit or even if when I'm smoking I should smoke more so that I'm hit with more CBD initially which will mellow me out to start? 

As you can see I'm quite unsure so any help would be appreciated, hopefully if anyone else is struggling with this and just wants to chill they'll be able to help themselves too!

After I went home I felt a bit high after  feeling sober for like 1h after the nicotine and alcohol. I once read that you can fail a thc test after doing sports even though you smoked weed months before because some thc might be stored in your body fats. I accidentally drank the part with the most butter from a thc tea so I probably hat thc from like 7g of weed therefore I got really fried and I ate a lot.
 My theory is, that I had a lot of thc in my fat and I lost it while dancing to get high afterwards. It might be placebo but it really felt like being high.",0

"Smoking weed ruined my life I live in a country in which weed isn‚Äôt legal so you have to get it from dealers without rly knowing what substances are actually  inside the pot you‚Äôre buying. I never bought weed but I used to smoke my friends‚Äô and every time everything played out as I expected it to: I got high, it felt amazing and a few hours later I was back to being my usual  self. 

Well that I was until I smoked with these friends that I‚Äôm not very close with for the first time, it was this shitty-looking hash that I‚Äôm almost certain was laced with some crap cos I had a massive panic attack while on it, had an awful headache accompanied by nausea and terrible brain fog and the worst part was that I smoked it about three weeks ago and I feel like I never properly came down from that high. I‚Äôve become retarded since then, I can‚Äôt make logical connections, I lose any train of thought I start and I find it hard to express myself verbally. The friends I chilled with are known as my school‚Äôs stoners and I thought they were all fried because of the huge amount of thc they put inside their bodies everyday but now I understand that the thc‚Äôs not the one to blame given that the weed they usually have is defs laced.

"i need somes advices guys please so, basically i'm a french-guy and i used to smoke weed with somes friends back in high-school

Now i'm grown-up, and most of my friends went-away

I got a job, i work everydays, it's a pretty physical one too

And i got pretty-shitty superiors who do nothing all-day long,

But still manage to throw shit at me for coming 10-minutes lates one-day in the span of 9 months

It's tiring, and my life as been stressful for some-times now

So i just want to blow some steam-off at the end of the week basically

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been thinking of smoking weed again

The thing is:

\-i absolutely hate tobacco

\-and my friends went-away and we stopped talking since years because we all had to do our lifes separated

&amp;#x200B;

I still take somes news from them, because i want to keep contact and know if they're having a good-life

It would be extremely awkward and insincere from me to just straight-up ask them to put me in contact with somes dealers near my location

&amp;#x200B;

So basically

I've been thinking about growing weed

It's illegal to smoke, or grow-it here, but it's not illegal to buy seeds

Don't ask-me why, it's stupid, that's all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty alright at gardening flowers, fruits, and vegetables

So i think it wouldn't be too hard for me

But i have no ideas what kind of seeds i should-buy, or how to make-it grow

When the plant will be grown-up, how do i ""extract""-it?

And how should i consume it, i don't really want to go back to smoke with cigs, i hate-it

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be alright to just buy the ""finished-product"" from someone

But since it's reddit, i guess most of you guys are not in France, which would make it impossible

And it would probably be illegal and i wouldn't want to put anyone in troubles for this",0

"Eye twitch ? Hi guys,

So i'm vaping concentrate (only 3 puffs at night before going to sleep) and I usually get the rose gold from Bloom farms. Now about a month ago my dispensary advised me to try Unwind from Ace extracts and after smoking it I developped a left eye twitch.

What I notice is if I don't smoke for like 2 days, the eye twitch goes away and if I smoke, sure enough the next morning it comes back.

Do you think it's something in the Ace extracts product that might trigger this or is it weed in general? I've been smoking weed for years and never had this before but maybe I'm getting older and that's what weed does to me now.

I'll definitely get back to rose gold after I finish to use the Unwind but was wondering if any of you had experience with this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",0

"My heart almost stopped after smoking weed. Recently around a month ago I was hospitalized for smoking weed, i smoked out of a vaporizer which I found out later had to do with it. This particular vape hit really hard and always had you high to the point where you‚Äôd be so lazy that you wish you could move but you couldn‚Äôt.
 After I‚Äôm done, maybe around 20 minutes, my heart starts beating so fast that my chest starts feeling hot to the touch and I start getting the symptoms of a heart attack, I am young and my heart has always been healthy and stable. My jaw started to feel weird and my whole left side went limp and it felt like my bicep was being pulled apart from end to end. It was so intense that I thought I could be having a Charlie horse. 
It had got so intense that I had to go to the hospital and I‚Äôm not like any of those people who gets so high that they go to the hospital because there scared, no there was actually something wrong.
But it was only till after the hospital visit I learned that my heart could of actually stopped. I have an app on my phone called heart rate free and it‚Äôs 100% accurate (I tested it at the hospital with the machine next to me) and before I even thought about going to the hospital it read 175 bmp which was very dangerous for me to have been laying down doing nothing. It had been going for hours and  I was scared I had a blood clot or something was wrong with my heart. But it was just doing its job because when I got to the hospital and they ran blood tests I found out the large amounts of thc in my system were making me dehydrated and thickening up my blood making my heart work way harder than it needed to. If I would‚Äôve stayed at home I could‚Äôve had a heart attack and died cause that was was slowly happening. My heart needed to beat faster to get more blood to my organs but I found out the faster it went the more blood and hydration it would need but since I was dried up it was basically doing everything it could to stay alive. The hospital realized this and quickly put fluids in me and re-hydrated me which is when my heart rate of 190 went down to 100 which is how they double checked from the blood tests that it was the problem because my heart stated to calm down after it. They told me to be careful and sent me home where it went down even more from that. 

What I‚Äôm saying is that nobody can die from weed but you can die from dehydration. And  It still scares me to this day knowing that I could‚Äôve died from it. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed since and I‚Äôm not planning too because hours of constant beating at high Bpm‚Äôs can really affect your hearts health and I‚Äôm worried if it happens again I won‚Äôt be able to live to tell the story again. Be safe when smoking large amounts and especially if your hot boxing bring as much water as you can. Believe it or not it could save your life. And remember this, if your eyes and your mouth are super dry, your organs are the same way. Stay safe.",0

So here's the thing - I recently went to the local confectionery store and talked to this guy about buying some oil. My intention was to put some hybrid / sativa based oil Double Delicious (Seattle supplier)  into my own cookies and such. I've recently moved to the UK and bought a vape pen and put some of the oil in the pen. However I think that the guy at the pot shop told me the wrong info because on the back of the packaging it says that there is coconut oil in this item and says for external use only. So I think the shit I bought is a topical oil.

- did I just fuck up my vape pen by putting a topical oil in it?

- are there negative health affects by vaping a topical oil?

- Does anyone know anything about the brand Double Delicious from Tacoma Seattle? Do you think I was sold a topical oil or something else?

"Coming out of a grow box. Hi fellow potheads.

I have been smoking for something close to 10 years now. I tried to quit but, even after almost 4 months of absolute abstinence I did not see any benefits. 

I mean the short term memory improved , but I was so tense and sleepless and pissed off that the total effect was negative.

Looks like i am one of those who need to smoke to function. 

Well I want to come out with it and stop hiding and just smoke whenever I want.

But the problem is that weed is considered illegal in my country. 

I mean I can make it legal just for me as a medicine, but still being a pothead is frown upon. 

Any advices ? 

Should I even come out with that? And if not, do any of you have pro tips regarding smoking at work.

"The Boundy Buds So this is a story about some friends of mine, about a ""strain"" that we smoked for awhile that was wack. So a guy named Boundy grows weed, the weed is called boundy bud and from my short experience is full skitz, now I've done my fair share of psychedelics so weed now is still just a one way ticket to a trip, I was there for one of these events and heard about the other last night, first event was with a mate who we will call Tom asked me to pack him a phat cone and I did, he was already pretty stoned and we had a new massive party sized cone piece, so he punched the cone pulled it through was fine, maybe an hour passes and he asks for another this is where shit hits the fan a bit, I packed it to the rim was a bit bigger than the last one but i thought he would be fine but yeah nah, punches it pull it through looks like hes gonna green, i was thinking she'll be right, he was on the ground at this point and gets up stumbling around and blacks out falling smashing his head into a wood been a cutting his face up pretty bad then well having a seizure for no longer than 5 seconds, full fucked, he was alright after just really out of it but we took care of him and having his girlfriend there helping him out all night, he was fine  and still smokes weed.
So I asked him about it and he said it had happened before on the same strain maybe two weeks prior, got me thinking that it wasn't him hitting his head that caused it and more evidence has come to light, so this other mate we will call Ted had apparently been punching cones all night asked for one more and had blacked out and had a seizure as well for again no longer than 5 seconds.

"Weird trip I was hitting some new shit with a friend of mine, had 2 J's I think. I didn't think they were hitting so I was taking some massive drags. Little did I know, apparently it was hitting fine. Cause before we finished passing the second one around, I was so fucked, I was sitting there just watching the trees in the background form into one color. I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. I remember asking them if I fell asleep I must've sounded like a fucking psycho cause it was like 15 seconds after I handed them a J. It felt like an hour or two for me. After that I just kinda sat there while they smoked the rest. Through the next 20 mins or so. My vision was fucked like it is when you get a blood rush. I was almost nauseous and got really dizzy when I stood up. I remember two images that would morph back from each other the whole time when I closed my eyes. One was a family portrait that hung in the living room of my house. And the other was the old red black and white buffalo sabres logo. To this day I have no idea what happened. I just assume it had something to do with the dope and my body cause they smoked the same thing and we're fine. Have you guys ever had something similar happen or know what that could've been.",0

The other night (Friday) I went to a party. I was drinking whisky at first and then I was offered some weed, so I was like hell yh and smoked the shit out of it. About 10 minutes later I started feeling really trippy. I started to feel like nothing was real like I wasn't real. Then I went and sat down for a bit and after I got up when I walked it was like I was teleporting about. I continued to drink and then I started to hear that people weren't actually saying. Well, I'm not sure if they were actually saying these things but I think it was something I hallucinated. I asked my older brother what it was and he said it was something called sycosis. I looked into what that sycosis is and it sounded like what I experienced but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After that night it has felt like I am still slightly detached from my mind and body and every so often I will feel like nothing is real. I have started to smoke a lot more than I'm used to if that helps.

&amp;#x200B;

(Sativa) Laughing Buddha: makes you more giggly and personally makes me more talkative and focused, and a massive cerebral wave radiates from my body. Overall a great daytime strain, pure happiness and upbeat for hours. 

(Hybrid) Cookie Breath: This strain is a ""couch lock"" if you smoke a lot. It makes your body melt into whatever you're sitting or laying on; can be used for nighttime or daytime use. A blissful mood washes over your entire body - euphoric. 

(Indica) Casper OG: My favorite stain for sleeping at the moment, personally. It calms the mind and almost feels like it forces you to lay down, your mind is very, very calm. You hit the bed numb, euphoric and not wanting to move. You fall into a deep, relaxing sleep.",0

No matter what I smoke out of I get it, I have also tried different strains and still my dry mouth is embarrassingly bad. 

I have tried ; drinking water, chewing sugarless gum, soda, popsicles, mints. These all have helped but only temporarily I have to constantly drink water so much that it makes me pee a lot lol. Dry mouth comes back no matter what.

"Weed teaches me. Im 17, I haven‚Äôt smoked pot very much, and I don‚Äôt smoke often at all, but then again, I‚Äôm probably too young to be smoking pot in the first place. I‚Äôd like to think of myself as pretty mature for my age, and while my friends are off their faces laughing and having fun, it seems that weed makes me hallucinate mildly. I have not done any drugs other than weed, but I get mild visuals both open and close eyed, more often than not while my eyes are opened. Every time it feels like those visuals try to teach me something or deliver me a message, most the time it is when music is playing. On the come up I almost always get a roller coaster visual that makes me believe that what the plant is trying to tell me is that I‚Äôm still at the beginning of the road but that I‚Äôm about to blast off because I do struggle with my sense of confidence a lot. I‚Äôve also been shown myself on a stage a few times which it makes me feel better overall because I am an artist and it feels like it is telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôll make it, your hard work WILL pay off, just keep working‚Äù.  The high also lasts me much longer than my friends, feeling after effects for quite a while after smoking, up to days at a time, so I always smoke when I know I have nothing important to do for at least the next whole day. (Went to work once and it was wild, felt like I was high my whole shift‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I get a LOT of enjoyment and recreation off weed, and I know my shit isn‚Äôt laced (none of my friends hallucinate either) but it feels like weed often interrupts the ‚Äúfun‚Äù in a good way, to teach me something or send me a message. Yeah that‚Äôs all I have I just thought I‚Äôd share it with all y‚Äôall! Peace. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Anyone use the Truva Mini 2.0? or vape herb in general? i am trying out the truva mini 2.0 and it smells like burnt popcorn. ive tried going online to find reasons behind it and its only tips for vape juice and not convection for dry herb. i think the default temp was 385. ive tried 400 then dropped to 300 then moved up to 350 as i was barely pulling any hits. like i was inhaling so hard i was getting high off inhaling too hard and not the herb. Lastly, how do you know when your done? when i look into the chamber and see that the herb has turned and orange/brownish color im assuming ive ""sucked it dry"" and theres no more?

"Weed &amp; Neurological disorders So for a little background, I am 19 and I have several neurological conditions, listed below

Tourette Syndrome

OCD

ADHD

Anxiety

Aspergers/Mild Autism-unofficial diagnosis, I have been told by several neurologists and therapists that I have it, but going thru the diagnosis process isn‚Äôt worth it since I don‚Äôt take medicine for anything.

So I have used marijuana for 8-10 months at this point, I never really smoke more than once or twice every 3 months. I have not taken any prescription medication for my neurological conditions in 6+ years, but I have noticed marijuana does have a profound effect on my conditions. 

After smoking, I have less noticeable tics from my TS, even tho my TS is already very mild. I also have an easier time dismissing obsessive thoughts and have less anxiety, I have yet to study my ADHD while high; however, I noticed I have higher social function when I am high. 
Those effects aside, I have also noticed some after effects when I loose the high‚Ä¶

For a period of 1-2 months after smoking I notice I can focus better, have less anxiety, and less issues with mood and my disorders. After some research, I believe this to be attributed to weed‚Äôs affects on serotonin levels. CBD acts like serotonin and THC has been reported to negatively effect the ability of serotonin reuptake. I believe this makes weed act like an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), resulting in increased free serotonin levels in my body for a period of time after smoking weed.

Please tell me your thoughts on the subject and post any questions you have for me. I‚Äôm just as curious as you may be about this!",0

"Creativity &gt; Disassociation Hi there! 1st posting here. 
I was wondering if anyone knows if there's any strains that won't induce so much depersonalization/derealization. I have mental illnesses, but smoking sometimes helps me to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. Helps me to write my mind out, too, which is great. But sometimes I get badly disassociated and it friggin sucks cuz I suffer from this, anyway. 
How can I take advantage of the good benefits and not feel awful at the same time? D:
I know this is a long shot, but I would love some advice.

I've seen people put dab oil into ground weed and smoke it, but we don't have any. can we just smoke it straight out of a bowl? or is there something else to do with it to get us high?",0
"Ever since I ate an edible I‚Äôve been feeling depressed. I know I have posted this question before I do apologize but I feel like I want more answers :( First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it‚Äôs very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I‚Äôm saying, feeling like I‚Äôm not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I‚Äôm talking and it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôm not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I‚Äôve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it‚Äôs making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( I feel hopeless",0

For myself, i've been in the ballpark of about 3 times a day and a 4th every week for a pretty long time, but i'd be curious to see how other people's tolerances, preferences, circumstances, or just general inclination would differ from mine, especially with something as specific and varied as cannabis.

Side note, if you like i'd also be curious to know how much you think is best for someone who is a regular cannabis user, or how much you'd like to consume compared how much you do currently.",0

"Does weed make you lose weight? Some of my family members and family friends look very skinny, not anorexic, but skinny enough for others to notice and be concerned about. My cousins (family friends) look very pale, skinny, face sunken in a little. They smoke like fucking trains. Recently one of them had a baby and thankfully gained weight back so she looks a lot better now. Unless they're doing other drugs like popping pills along with smoking. 

I'd like to start smoking for my anxiety and honesty for fun as well. I obviously don't want to smoke every single day, just every once in a while. I have to approach this to my parents (I'm 18, still living a home obviously. Why wouldn't I get their permission?). My mom used to smoke when she was teenager, this back in the late 80s, early-mid 90s. So I'm pretty sure that the 1990 weed and 2019 weed are completely different now. More chemicals, I guess. Maybe they put chemicals in the plants to speed up the growing process and that's what makes people skinny? 

Anyways I'm just afraid that if I start smoking, I may lose a significant amount of weight. I'm only 120lbs, 5'5"" so put that into perspective.",0

"Fuck my life So after some time saving money i finally ordered my oil pen 2 days ago(thursday july 4).I did my research and ordered it from a well known supplier here in my country. In the courrier's app it said it will arrive on monday (july 8). The pen ended up  arriving today saturday (july 6). To my surprise,my mom wakes me up saying that a package has arrived for me. ""OH SHIT""was all i could think about  and she obviously saw it on my face.The doorman had called to notify about the package and she  had  recieved it...I planned on giving him(doorman) the heads-up to not give the package to ANYONE BUT ME and give him the shipping money , eventually...Since i still (in theory) had a few days left before it arrived.Long story short I told my mom the package that had arrived was a ps4 game as i went towards my bedroom.She came right behind me and asked me to open it and show it to her.So i did... I already knew i was fucked anyways...   
I Opened it and only showed the battery.She looked at the opened package and saw the cartidge's packaging that fucking says THC CANNABIS OIL all over it.

Fuck man... she was so fucking sad and pissed.
She returned to my room a few minutes later crying saying that this was too much for her and that she's worried about me.She asked me the whole worried-mom questions like ""You were smoking all these time,why do you do this? I cant trust you"" (she absolutely hates all drugs and never had to deal with any of these things in my family).It broke her heart.And in return it broke mine too.I've been a stoner for a few years now and i've always have been very obsessed about my family not catching me. My mom catched me like a year ago and i told her it was a one time thing.She gave me the benefit of the doubt i guess and gave me another chance.I fucking blew it in such a stupid way.What the fuck do i do now?

"One time I got so high I couldn‚Äôt understand English anymore (sadly this is not a joke lol) So a while back, I went on a 3 month tolerance break, and upon coming back, I decided to take a fat. ass. bonger. This bonger fucked my shit, no joke, let me explain to you how this bonger made me unable to understand what people were saying. Something you should no first, is that my memory is notoriously bad when I‚Äôm high, but this time was different, my memory would only last for a couple of seconds at a time, it was so bad, I would forget entire sentences while they were being spoken to me. For example, one of my friends asked me ‚Äúdid you have a test yesterday‚Äù and I was just like ‚Äúuuuuhhhh... what did you just say?‚Äù And they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúdid you have a test?‚Äù And I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù And they‚Äôd say ‚Äúyesterday!‚Äù And then I would say ‚Äúwhat happened yesterday?‚Äù. It was bad, I knew the words coming out of their mouths, but I couldn‚Äôt remember them long enough to form an actual sentence in my mind, so it just sounded like a bunch of words that had nothing to do with each other. At one point, someone would be talking to me, and then I would get hung up on something they said and then just think about it for like 15 seconds while they continued to talk, then when I was done thinking I would just walk away because I forgot that they were talking to me, then they‚Äôd come up and be like ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù And I‚Äôd say ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù and then he would say ‚ÄúI was talking to you‚Äù and I would just be like ‚Äúreally? When?‚Äù. Basically, for an hour and a half, I was trapped inside my mind and my shitty memory, my memory got so bad, that at one point, I thought I was stuck in a loop, because I would be listening to my friend talking to someone, then walk away, come back 2 mins later and that person is still talking to someone, I‚Äôd sit down and start listening, then I‚Äôd think ‚Äúwoah, I was just here listening to this exact convo‚Äù (which it wasn‚Äôt), I would then get up, walk away and come back to do it over again. And I have never been so zooked in my entire life since then, probably never will be.",0
"My first REAL experience As the title says, this would be the story of the first real time I‚Äôve actually smoked weed. Before you ask, I‚Äôve taken 1-2 hits off a bong or off a joint before this. Not enough to get me high or to actually really feel anything. Pretty much blue balls for getting high. 
.
.
Anyway, me and my friend were in his living room just relaxing. Asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said sure it why not. He rolled us up a blunt and went to town. After about 7-8 hits I really started to feel it. Now I‚Äôm no expert on weed or anything so I don‚Äôt know what kind of weed we were smoking. After I started to feel the high coming on, he kept talking to me and asking me questions but I couldn‚Äôt speak lol. I wanted to talk to him but I couldn‚Äôt physically bring myself to say anything at all. Like there was tape over my mouth or something. After a few more hits I decided I was high enough and stopped. I looked around and everything felt like I was in a play? Like none of this was real in a sense? It felt like people were watching us on tv or me and my friend were acting out a play. It was really weird but really cool. I guess the whole ‚Äúwere all in a simulation‚Äù theory. Then ‚ÄúI Fall Apart‚Äù by Post Malone came on and I bust into tears thinking about my ex. Idk why I cried. I felt like a wimp so after I got done crying I laughed extremely hard at myself ahaha. I could not stop laughing. Then I eventually passed out and woke up the next morning. Interesting night for sure lmao",0

What to do during a T-Break So I just smoked my last bit for a while because I need to take a tolerance break as well as just stay clean over summer but Everytime I try and take a break I smoke about a week after because everything becomes boring much quicker.

"My mom just ate my fucking edible. This is not a fucking drill!

So I was unpacking my thing in my room and I had my two weed cookies on top of my clothes in a Saran Wrap in my luggage so I had to take them out to get to my clothes. I put them on my bed and went to the bathroom. I‚Äôm such a fucking idiot. 

So she has this tendency to just eat people‚Äôs food is she sees it laying around which pisses off my dad and I. Like I didn‚Äôt think she would come in my room. I was freaking out when I heard her come in and was like ‚ÄúGosh did you have to bring home your whole closet?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to bring attention to the edibles since it was going to be suspicious so I just hoped she would notice it. 

Then I heard her say ‚ÄúAww you brought me cookies?‚Äù

And I was like ‚ÄúNo, sorry. They‚Äôre for me.‚Äù And she started getting offended for no reason and was like ‚ÄúYou always have to be so selfish.‚Äù and blah blah blah lol.

I didn‚Äôt want to press it to much because I didn‚Äôt want her to think something was up with them and I was worried. 

Now I‚Äôm fucking screwed. Im just going to pretend like I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with her when it kicks in. I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre medication is acting up again.‚Äù. But I‚Äôm kind of scared because she literally never smoked or consumed weed except for that so-called time in college but I doubt she inhaled lol.

She‚Äôs going to freaking the fuck out. 

I‚Äôm just mad that she ate that shit and now I only have one left to enjoy... I had a dream this shit would happen.

I‚Äôll update in like an hour.

I‚Äôm soooooo scared. She‚Äôs gonna be so fried. I only eat like a quarter and I smoke every day. Imagine her on a whole one and there was more than a gram in that cookie.... omfg. Fuck my life....

Update:

Okay so she‚Äôs literally normal. People keep asking what‚Äôs happening and... nothing is happening. I guess since she ate dinner it‚Äôs taking a while but I‚Äôm gonna say in the next 20 minutes she gonna feel it. I‚Äôve been just casually peaking downstairs to check in on her. I do not want to be around when it hits tbh but I know I have to be since my dad is gonna be so confused lmao.

Meanwhile I‚Äôm smoking a roach in my bathroom lmaooo. 

**UPDATE**

Yooooo. She‚Äôs tweakinnnn.

I‚Äôm just laying in bed and I hear ‚ÄúJesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Lawd have mercy! God help me!‚Äù 

Yoooo helppppo 

UPDATE

I‚Äôm laughing my fucking ass offffff I went downstairs and my dad is literally trying to hold her up bro. AHHHHHHH. Yo she‚Äôs gonee. She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúMe gettin heart palpations. Lawd help me.‚Äù‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 

Her eyes are red as shit oh my fuck

UPDATE

She‚Äôs find rn. She‚Äôs laying on the couch and quieted down. I think she‚Äôs going to just fall asleep. I gave her tea per her request and she not asking for food which is surprising. 

I‚Äôm playing Elvis music for her lmao and she‚Äôs loving it. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

UPDATE

She finally went up to her bed and let me help her up. Literally when her head hit that pillow she knocked the fuck out. 

We‚Äôre all going bed now. I don‚Äôt know what tomorrow will bring but yeah. Thanks for still around guys. I‚Äôll update tomorrow (today).

And also thanks for all the likes. This shit blew up lmaoo. 

UPDATE (NEXT MORNING 7:16 am)

I woke up early cause I just do that shit and my dad is up I think but I haven‚Äôt heard my mom. She‚Äôs usually up at like 6. 

I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs still tired from it but I‚Äôm getting up to check on her. I feel like like my dad is gonna be pissed. Then again he doesn‚Äôt really know about weed edibles or anything.

A lot of fucking people are saying that I poisoned my mom. I did not poison my mom. You‚Äôre insane for saying that. These are EDIBLES not fucking arsenic. She ate them herself after I told her not to. READ THE POST. She was just high as hell but mellowed out after like an hour and a half. My family and I calmed her down and made her comfortable and she went to bed close to 1 am. 

I would never poison my mom. So people accusing me of that are ridiculous. My mom is fine and alive.

Lastly, I‚Äôm tired of people assuming my race and gender lmao. Maybe the majority of the people in this subreddit are white males but I‚Äôm a Black female. Okay? Lol. I‚Äôm her daughter. 

My parents are Jamaican but no they‚Äôre not one of those ‚ÄúOne love. One heart. Let‚Äôs smoke together and feel alright.‚Äù type Jamaicans. So that‚Äôs why telling them about the edible is probably the worst thing to do. 

I‚Äôm not a terrible person. Accidents happen. I‚Äôm not the first person whose parent has eaten their edible. This is why you don‚Äôt eat people‚Äôs food after they tell you not to. Alright? Geez. (Now people are going to think I‚Äôm an asshole for saying that.)

UPDATE (7:50 AM)

My mom is finally awake and she looks GONE. Like her eyes are droopy. However she getting suspicious.

‚ÄúI think who ever made those cookies needs to learn to bake.‚Äù Baaaahh

No, because you got baked af last night... I‚Äôll stop. 

I don‚Äôt know how she still woke up early but I can tell she still feels it. She‚Äôs just confused and saying weird things. She‚Äôs also really uncoordinated and irritated. 

I‚Äôm debating if I should just tell her but I don‚Äôt want to give her a bad image of weed. The other day we were literally talking about the benefits of it and now she‚Äôs going to think it‚Äôs a terrible drug... know her she‚Äôll think they were laced with some hard drug like coke or something. 

She‚Äôll never forget this though...

UPDATE (9:13 AM)

BROOO MY FUCKING BROTHER. 

Okay so basically my brother started playing Broccoli by DRAM and my mom was like ‚ÄúWhy you have to play something so vulgar.‚Äù and my brother was like ‚ÄúMom, listen to the song. I think you can relate a little.‚Äù And she was still confused and I was trying to eye my brother like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell her!‚Äù

Then he fucking says ‚ÄúYou ate ate an edible.‚Äù

My mom: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an edible?‚Äù 

My brother: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like weed made into food and you ate a whole one last night.‚Äù

I hate this motherfucker brooooo.

She‚Äôs so pissed now. We had this whole ass argument while my brother thinks it‚Äôs funny.

This man stays getting me in trouble. Omfggggg. 

LAST UPDATE (11:56 AM)

So she‚Äôs sober now as far as I know. She‚Äôs still very pissed after finding out. I lied and said I threw the other one away (wondering why she didn‚Äôt ask for proof). 

Her exact words when my brother told her it was an edible we‚Äôre. ‚ÄúYa better be lyin‚Äô, ya see! If that cookie had drugs it- Jesus, Lawd...‚Äùüò©üç™

My brother: ‚ÄúIt just had weed.‚ÄùüòÜüçÅ

My mom: ‚ÄúPeople ah smoke weed an‚Äô demma eat deh something too? Mm mm. No. What if me was dead? Eh? Suppose me have a heart attack?‚Äùüò°üáØüá≤

Me: ‚ÄúNo one has died from weed.‚Äù üòÇ

My mom: ‚ÄúYou look here, likkle girl üëßüèΩ. Me nah listen to any of ya foolishness. Ya bring that somethin in me house again and you gon see what‚Äôs in store fah you!!‚Äù üò°üò°

Bruh. I had to write it exactly how she said it or else it isn‚Äôt as accurate nor funny. So she basically just yelled at me and threaten me. Lol. I honestly don‚Äôt give a fuck. üòàProbably gonna smoke in this house and bring weed cause ya girl needs her weed so. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

By the end of the day, she‚Äôll cool down and one day we‚Äôll all laugh about this. Don‚Äôt leave your freaking edibles out kids! Some of you White people are lucky. Your mom would probably be like ‚ÄúYou ought to not let this happen again, Christopher. You‚Äôre grounded for two days. This is a warning.‚Äù. Lol joking... don‚Äôt get offended lmao.

Alright, I‚Äôm done lol.

UPDATE (9:03 PM)

So I ate a quarter of the edible that was left and brooo. That shit kicked me in the ass in just 40 minutes. I‚Äôm so high.... I almost forgot to post this",0

"I decided to quit smoking I am a 21 year old recently graduated history teacher, and as far as I can remember from my college days, I have smoked a lot. It consumed much of my money and my humor, the taste, now that I come to think of it, is awful, and the smell just really bothers me in the nose.

Therefore, I have made a decision. Everytime I have money to buy cigarettes, I'll go out and buy some weed, because that'll finally get me to stop smoking these damn cigarettes.

"86 yr old grandmother finally said yes to edibles This is such a wholesome post but a bit long yet I'm so excited....
My husband's grandmother who is 86 yrs old (very religious  and law abiding but lives in an illegal state) has had bone spurs that have kept her in bed alot. She was on oxycodone for years at a high dose and went through full withdrawal when her insurance stopped covering. DESPERATE for relief. 
She finally said she wanted edibles and I live in a legal state so a family member came to visit and brought her back some, thinking it might not work.  WELL, she ate one and is walking around without her walker, eating sandwiches and laughing at the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" as I type this.
I am over the moon for her.",0
