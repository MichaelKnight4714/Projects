It has a ton of cheeses with descriptions and you can rate them and save them. Also, if you can't find a cheese, you can upload it to their app and they will find more info/pics and add it, usually really quickly! They send an email letting you know they posted it for you.

For various circumstances, I'm going to be fridge-less for the next two or three weeks while I'm between apartments.

I did a little experiment with Gouda this week and I have to say I was quite amazed: it actually tasted better and was lovely and soft (the ""sweating"" was a little offputting at first, but I quickly got over it).

Any other recommendations? Ideally I'd like something as hard as possible.

The result is almost always amazing, the cheeses usually gain a ton of flavor, intensity and develop a sharpness the would never have had at their expiration date. 

Unfortunately, the result sometimes looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/nuv1bQ8.jpg) or even far worse, with a sunken rind or covered with tiny white freckles. Also some of these cheeses smell so strong that my wife demands that I repeatedly check if they are still edible.

Just to make that clear: I can tell an edible cheese from a spoiled one and make sure to always stay on the safe side.

So I finally managed to find a place in my city that sells Provolone, a small Italian shop. I have never handled Provolone before, and the one I bought is very different from what I've seen used online (typically in America, usually soft, round slices).

The context of this purchase is to use it on pizza, meaning I want to shred it. But I read online that this cheese has a wax rind, and since I am a complete cheese rookie, I can't say that I am confident in handling this product. So I've come to you...

Edit:spelling mistake ",,"I had some (delicious) Morbier the other day from a restaurant on a cheese plate. It was already sliced up into small pieces, and the rind was still intact on either end of the piece. In fact, the rind was quite delicious: Lightly crunchy from the crystallization with a bit of funk and salt. Really complemented the meat of the cheese well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I bought a big slice of Morbier from the cheese shop the other day and I noticed something different. The rind near the ""back"" edge of the cheese (that is, where the outer edge of the wheel would be, basically) was extremely hard. Like hard enough that I'd just assume it was not edible.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, as you move towards the tip of the slice (what would be the center of a wheel), the rind gets noticeably softer. There's basically a gradient along the slice where it goes from incredibly hard to reasonably soft. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question: Do you just eat the rind up to the point where it becomes unpleasantly hard for your personal taste? That would be my assumption, I guess, but I wanted to get other people's opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question: I always thought Morbier was a washed rind cheese. But if that's the case, how could the rind of this slice I bought be so hard at the back? Has my assumption that all washed rind cheeses have \*soft\* rinds been wrong all along? Can washed rinds be hard??","I‚Äôm taking the CCP finally thanks to a gracious gift from my husband and his family.

But when I put Brie or Camembert on bread I find it bland. When I eat it straight off the cheese knife, the flavour's more intense and enjoyable. I even more love soft blue cheese- I eat it straight off my finger. haha

I wonder what other types of cheeses are ideal for this type of eating?","I'm on a CICO diet whereby I eat anything I like provided I stick to under 1,500 calories daily.

After health essentials like protein, vegetables and fruit, I allocate around 100 calories for a special daily treat. I'm surprised that rather than ice-cream, chocolate or chips, it's CHEESE that I want to 'spend' the luxury calories on.

Cheese is very high in calories. How do cheese lovers consume so many types without getting fat? I'd love to try a French cheese course with three to five cheese types but unless they're thumbnail-size pieces I can't see how you don't get fat.",,,"A lot has been written about this cheese, and it is very very good! I love the crumbly texture, the crystallization and of course the sharpness. But ... perhaps this is just semantics, but on the label it reads: ""Tastes like a aged premium cheddar with a hints of parmesan."" So, I always wonder if it is in fact truly aged, or they perform some trick with the parmesan to make it ""taste"" like its aged? Anyone know? I still like the stuff so no worries, but curious ...",,,"In France there are multiple and various types of cheeses and we don‚Äôt understand why it is not the same in other countries.
Plus, why cheeses or cheese making skills can‚Äôt be reused in countries different from the original ?",,,"The context is that I told the people in charge of a charcuterie board situation at work to get cheese from two different places - 1. A supermarket in Toronto 2. A local deli/cheese/butcher shop, so this cheese could be from either place. On the night of said party, people were all leaving and we decided to just cut chunks of cheese from the boards and take them home as they'd just sit around over the weekend. I took a chunk of manchego and then spotted this guy and took a chunk off too.

The clues:

1. I know it said Castello and 'mild' on the rind of the wedge. Bear in mind, it was a wedge and not a block. It also was not a Castello mild blue cheese, trust me, I looked.
2. It had a light blue Castello motif but the chunk I cut off has neither of these marks. Was I imagining all of this? Let's hope not.
3. The cheese itself is white, but around the interior layer of the rind, it yellows a bit.
4. Very strong savoury taste, almost like cheddar but I don't think it's that..
5. Texture wise - it's not soft like a brie, a blue, a gorgonzola or a mature cheese like a parmesan. It's a little creamier than an aged cheddar I'd say, and has more white than yellow colour wise. Perhaps a goat's cheese? It reminds me a little of a less mature version of an Ontarian bandaged goat's cheese cheddar I've had before.
6. White wax rind, but with another layer below of ridged... rind..? I don't know what it is.
7. Last thing - Castello makes a ton of packaged blue cheeses. This was not packaged in that manner, it was definitely a wedge taken from a wheel and re-sold. The thing that's throwing me is that I can't find any other Castello cheeses with their logo printed on the actual outside of the wheel, sort of in the Louis Vuitton fashion.
8. I have googled 'white waxed Castello cheese' 'white mild Castello cheese' and 'Castello white wax blue logo cheese that's also white inside but has another layer and also tastes very nice' and can Google no more.
9. These sad photos of the cheese chunk may offer some more hints. I don't know.

Aaaaaagh.

In absolute awe of you that said it was a goat milk gouda, and even more in awe of /u/yasai who actually figured it out. I went to the store earlier before seeing the responses and did indeed confirm that it was a Cablanca Goat's Milk Gouda! Thank you all. Also try this cheese, it's pretty good!",,,,,,,,,,,"So, my boyfriend's brother used to smoke his own cheese. Once when I was visiting I mentioned that my favourite cheese is gouda, so he gave me a wedge of gouda that he had smoked. Unfortunately he passed away. Thing is, I still have the cheese.

I want to do something special with it, as I will never have another one. It also might help my boyfriend with his closure.

I'd probably like to make a special cheese board, with nuts, salami, dried fruits, and crackers that match the cheese, also maybe a good beer that goes well with gouda (my boyfriend does not like wine)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.","We love to eat cheese and meat, charcuterie plates.   Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to get out the cheese board and make it pretty but sometimes, like last night,  we get home late and just want to sit down and eat.  By the time I got cheese open and cut and wrapped.   Some meat open, cut, and wrapped it might have been 10 minutes.   I know that isn‚Äôt a lot of time but it would be nice to just throw some precut meat and cheese on a plate, grab a glass of wine and relax.

Does anyone open a block of cheese and/or meat and cut it all?   Wrap up what you don‚Äôt use for easy access in the future?

",,You just pay a certain amount a month and you get unlimited cheese,,,,,,,I love parmigiano (obviously) and pecorino. What other really hard cheeses are out there?,,,,,"I recently spent a few weeks sailing around Grenada and SVG. The only cheese in many of the grocery stores was a white cheddar, primarily Anchor brand, from New Zealand. Being more or less ignorant of the cheese market and politics outside of the US and Canada, this made me curious. Is there a reason for Kiwi cheese dominating the market in this little corner of the world, or is it just a coincidence? NZ seems like the least likely place from which to import cheese to the West Indies, and yet it seemed ubiquitous. ",,"First time checking out this subreddit, I was wondering if there were any common suggestions for websites or stores to buy cheese from.

Edit: thank you all for some great resources",,,"Why didn't anyone tell me the cheese was this good? I'm eating it with genoa salame and crackers, but I actually think it may be better on its own. What's a good cheese to try next?","I bought some olive bread (which is salty) and a round of Camembert (which is mild) to have pre-dinner tonight. 

However, when I unwrap the Camembert wheel it 1) is spotted with small brown spots on the rind instead of a smooth whitish color, and 2) smells unusual, like a faint ammonia aroma. I cut about a third of the wheel off and it's runny and bright yellow so I figure it's good. But the taste is off, like a stale salty taste is the best I can describe it.

I just bought it today so I thought wow that's odd. Then I check the best buy date and it says 1/29/19. Would this still be considered ok to eat and serve to a dinner guest? What would you do?",,,,,,,Hey everybody! I'm a Canadian in France for a couple weeks and I'm looking for cheese advice!

My best description of it is:

1.  It's a white cheese.
2.  It's tender, in between squishy and solid block cheese.
3. Creamy.
4. You buy it in blocks.
5. When you slice, your knife will have some of the creamy texture on it afterward.
6. Very slightly salty.
7. Nice slightly sour taste that stays in your mouth (the sourness is not as much as yogurt).
8. It does not have a strong smell.
9. It's not brittle (a given since it's fresh and creamy).
10. Not full of holes.
