Abbaye de Belloc,Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Belloc,France,Aquitaine,"8-9 in. diameter, 3-4 in. high",8-10 lbs,,Sheep,Raw,Firm,Animal,NaturalPaprika,Alpine-styleCheddar-like,Flavor added to rind,"Abbaye de Belloc is a French cheese that is made by Benedictine monks at the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Belloc in the Western Pyrenees. The monks developed this sheep’s milk cheese in the 1960s, though its recipe is based on another local classic, Ossau Iraty.Abbaye de Belloc is produced pasteurized sheep`s milk sourced from red-nosed Manech ewes. Farmhouse sheep’s milk cheese production in this mountainous region is resolutely seasonal, with cheesemaking taking place mainly between December and the end of July.After production, wheels of Abbaye de Belloc are aged for four to ten months prior to release andsale. The youngest wheels are made in December and sent to market in April, while the older cheeses are made in July and held until the following April or May.The rind of Abbaye de Belloc has a reddish hue overlaid with brown and grey molds. Its texture is firm and supple with an interior paste that is dense, smooth, and ivory in color.Abbaye de Belloc is typically sweet and mild in flavor, with a pleasant brown butter aroma and hints of nuts and caramel.Pair with pinotnoir or shiraz."
Abbaye de Citeaux,Frère Joel & Frère Frédéric,France,Burgundy,8 in. diameter.  2 in. high,2 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,WashedMold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like)Washed-Rind,,"Located near Losne in Burgundy, France, Abbaye de Citaux is home to one of the most traditional and classic monastic washed-rind cheeses of Europe. The monks at the Abbaye de Cîteaux make cheese of the same name using the milk of their own herd of red and white Montbéliarde cows. The cows graze in the flat meadows surrounding the abbey for at least six months of the year. Although there is little left of the great Medieval abbeyas it was destroyed shortly after the French Revolution, it remains the spiritual center of the Cistercian Order and is open to the public for guided tours. The Abbey has a Benedictine foundation dating back to 1098 when the monks from Cluny settled in Cîteaux, wishing to follow a more disciplined way of life. (It`s the Abbey at Citeaux that gave its name to the reformed order of ""Cistercians."") The monks originally focused on winemaking, cultivating vines on the Côte d`Or and also building the Château du Clos de Vougeot. During the 19th century the Abbey was destroyed, and it was only after they returned that they took up cheesemaking. Today, the creamery at Abbaye de Citeaux is run by Frère Frédéric, and Frère Joel is the master cheesemaker. Production is small, with only 300 cheeses made every Monday and Tuesday, the majority of which are sold through the Abbey`s shop (the sales represent 50 percent of the Abbey`s income). After production, cheeses mature for three weeks at a temeprature of 37.4degreesFahrenheit and are washed with a brine solution to encourage the growth of the Bacterium Linens mold. By the third week, the rinds have become pale orange in color and are sometimes lightly covered with a white bloomy mold.The aroma of Abbaye de Citeaux is fairly pungent and stronger than the flavor of the cheese. The texture is semisoft and pliable, with a smooth, dense interior paste that is ivory-white in color with occasional small holes. Flavors are clean, milky, earthy, and pleasantly barnyard-y, with a gentle acidity and a lingering finish."
Abbaye de Tamie,Monks of Tamie,France,Savoie,"8 in. diameter, 2-3 in. high",3 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Made from raw cow`s milk, Abbaye de Tamie is produced by the monks at the Trappist Abbey of Tamié, located at the head of Val de Tamie in the Savoie region of southeastern France. The abbey was founded in 1131 by St. Pierre of Tarantaise and has a long and colorful history. The small dairy and cheesemaking operation is run by twelveof the monks, and it is believed that cheese has been made here for use in the refectory ever since the monastery was established. Although the milk formerly came from the abbey`s own herd, milk from Abondance cows is now sourced from four local farms, collected daily and brought to Tamié. The Monasteries of France are well known for their distinctive washed-rind cheeses, and Abbaye de Tamie is very typical of this style. Raw whole milk is warmed to 93degreesFahrenheit. Starter cultures made at the abbey are added and the milk is left to ripen for about ninetyminutes. Traditional rennet is added and, after the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut into pieces about the size of peas. The curds are then left for twentyminutes to drain naturally before being placed into molds. They`re gently pressed for about four hours to expel some of the remaining whey, which is processed into methanethatheats the abbey`s hot water system. After pressing, the cheeses are removed from the moldsand immersed in a brine bath for two to three hours before being transferred to vaulted cellars, where the temperature is maintained at 57degreesFahrenheit with high humidity. The Abbaye de Tamie is turned andflipped every other day to ensure even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese, and the wheel is washed with a brine solution to encourage the growth of the Bacterium linens mold that is naturally present in the cellar. Cheeses are aged for about four weeks. While maturing, the flavors of the cheese concentrate via moisture loss and evaporation. Appealingly, this is referred to by the monks as the ""Angels` share."" When they are ready for sale, the wheels are wrapped in the abbey`s distinctive blue-and-white paper, decorated with the white cross of Malta.The texture of Abbaye de Tamie is smooth, meltingly soft, and yielding. Rind color is orange-red and feels slightly sticky. The aroma of Abbaye de Tamie (like many other washed rind cheeses) is much more pungent than the flavor of the cheese, which is beautifully balanced and delicate with sweet notes of cream, salt, and hay."
Abbaye du Mont des Cats,Abbaye du Mont des Cats,France,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,"8 in. diameter, 4 in. high",4 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Washed,Alpine-styleWashed-Rind,,"Abbaye du Mont des Cats is a cow`s milk cheese made by monks at the monastery of the same name near Godewaersvelde (meaning God`s plain) in northern France. Cheese has been made here since 1880 using milk sourced from local farms. The cheese was a traditional favorite with the crews of sailing ships. Today, although tastes and patrons have changed, this small independent dairy still produces about 200 tons of cheese each year. Production methods for Abbaye du Mont des Cats are similar to those used for Port Salut. Milk is gently pasteurized for cheese production, and maturation takes place over a period of four to five weeks. During this time, cheeses are washed with a brine solution to encourage the growth of the Bacterium linens mold. They`re also dyed with roucou, a natural red dye derived from the seeds of the annatto shrub.The texture of Abbaye du Mont des Cats is smooth and supple, dotted with occasional small holes. The rind is an orange-red color and slightly tacky to the touch. Flavors are mild and subtle with notes of milk and hay."
Abondance,Various,France,Haut Savoie,"2 ¾ in. tall, 15 ¾ in. diameter",15 - 26 lbs,www.fromageabondance.fr/en/,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Named after a valley in the French Alps where the cheese is made-as well as the village where it was first produced-Abondance is a cheese with a long history. The Valley of Abondance, located in the Haute-Savoie region of the French Alps, is where France and Switzerland meet, but Abondance is made only on the French side of the border. For fifteencenturies, Abondance cows, with their brown bodies and distinctwhite markings, have grazed in Alpine pastures at altitudes of 4,300 to 6,000 feet above sea level during the summer. Along with two other local breeds, Tarentaise and Montbéliarde, Abondance cows produce the milk for this AOC/PDO-certified cheese. The first written record of Abondance is from the twelfth century. Monks in the valley began producing Abondance as a means of generating income for their monasteries. By the fourteenth century, the cheese had won acclaim throughout Europe, and in 1381 it was served to the Papal enclave in Avignon. Due to its long history, in 1990 it was awarded Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée protection. As part of this designation, Abondance must be made in a traditional manner, which includes regulations around the communities of dairies that produce the cheese. Currently there are around sixty licensedfarm and co-operative producers, or fruitières, of the cheese. They`re all located in the Haute-Savoie region, and the milk for the cheese must hail from the same area. To make the cheese, raw milk is poured into a copper cauldron, which is heated to warm the milk. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk and, once the curds are formed, they are cut and re-heated to a higher temperature before being cut again by hand. Then, using cheesecloth, curds are strained and placed into molds, which form the iconic wide wheels with concave sides. Once the shape of the cheese is established, thewheelsare removed from their molds, salted, and placed on spruce shelves in moist caves.Abondance has a bright orange rind as a result of its 100-day aging in the cool and moist aging caves. The interior paste is light yellow with a slight sheen and a few small eyes dotted throughout. The texture is smooth and rich. Like many other alpine cheeses, Abondance has a floral flavor with undertones of hazelnuts and nice acidity. Its flavors linger on the tongue.This cheese pairs nicely with various beers and dry white wines. It can be used as a table cheese and works best when served with green apples or cornichons. It also works very well in fondue or melted over root vegetables."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.  Made from a blend of sheep, goat and cow’s milk, production of Airco takes place in small batches with the aim of creating a cheese with a smooth, pliant texture.The rind of Airco is golden brown with an interior paste that is ivory in color.Finished cheeses are then naturally smoked over apple wood. This creates an array of balanced flavors that begin with sweet notes of sheep and cow’s milk and evolve into gentle flavors of goat’s milk mingled with smoke. This provides a cheeses with great depth and length of flavor.Good wine pairings include Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Merlot."
Almnäs Tegel,Almnäs Bruk,Sweden,Västra Götaland,20 in x 18 in x 5 in,57-59 lbs,www.almnas.com,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Tegel (which translates to “brick” in Swedish) is produced at Almnäs Bruk, an organic farm situated on the picturesque west coast of the second largest lake in Sweden, Lake Vättern. The history of the cheese dates back to the 18th century, when the estate was home to a brick factory. Bricks were left out in the sun to dry, and children on the farm would run over them while playing, leaving behind their footprints. The footprint became the logo of the brick company, and later, the symbol of Almnäs Tegel cheese. Subsequent owners, including great-grandfather of managing director Thomas Berglund, transformed the brick factory into a cheesemaking facility. They produced Wrångebäck Sweden, the country’s first officially registered cheese, until 1961. In 1987 due to his father’s poor health, Berglund returned to the estate from Switzerland, where had had been working, and decided to start making cheese again. After many years of planning, traveling to France and Switzerland to study cheesemaking, and gaining organic certification, he started production in 2008. To make Tegel, milk from the farm’s herd of 400 Holstein cows is pumped into a copper vat, two cultures are added, and the milk is warmed to 89 degrees. Rennet is added, and after about 35 minutes the curd is cut with rotating harps. Curd is stirred while being warmed to 123 degrees, then the contents of the vat are emptied into 14 square molds. After 19 hours of pressing, cheeses are imprinted with four footprints, then brined for 48 hours. During a subsequent aging period of 18-30 months, cheeses are washed with salt water less and less frequently.As it ages, Almnäs Tegel’s rind changes from creamy white to orange, ultimately turning into a deep reddish brown.As it ages, Almnäs Tegel`s flavor becomes increasingly rich and complex, with a saltiness and a prickliness on the tongue balanced by sweetness, caramel and a hint of grass.Pair it with a chardonnay, a riesling, a hard cider, or a bock beer."

When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 45 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, which comprise of 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of several other Vermont based producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Harbison, Moses Sleeper and Winnimere. Named after a local Greensboro Ancestor who was a philanthropic dairy farmer, Alpha Tolman is made using the traditional Alpine methods of cheesemaking. For production of this cheese, milk is sourced from a dairy called Andersonville Dairy, located in nearby Glover and the wheels are made at a second cheesemaking facility, also operated by Jasper Hill at the Food Venture Center in Hardwick, VT. By cooking and pressing the curds during production, the finished cheese has a tight, slightly elastic texture with robust and complex flavors. Newly formed wheels are regularly washed with a cultured brine that cultivates a red-orange rind and a depth of flavor to the interior paste. Young wheels have lactic notes balanced with a hint of citrus and an aroma of damp cellar. With age, wheels develop more meaty flavors accompanied by undertones of butter and caramelized onion.The interior paste of the cheese also becomes more dense and slightly crystalline.Alpha Tolman makes an ideal cheese for fondue or melted over fingerling potatoes. Also, try pairing it with a robust ale or a rich, plum-like red wine, or onion jam."

Alter Schweizer,Kaeserei Studer,,Thurgau,"14 ins diameter, 2.5 ins high",14 lbs,www.kaeserei-studer.ch,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,NaturalWashed,Alpine-styleWashed-Rind,,"Alter Schweizer (which translated means “Old Swiss”) is made by Daniel Studer at Kaeserei Studer AG in Hatswil. The dairy is located close to the Bodensee and the German border, just outside the town of Amriswil, in the very north eastern corner of Switzerland. Kaeserei Studer forms part of a consortium called Bodensee Kaese, which comprises four dairies in one small region. Each dairy produces its very own, unique cheeses. However, when it comes to marketing and selling them, they join forces, marketing them collectively with a regional identity.  Studer’s range of firm and hard cheeses are made exclusively from silage-free cow’s milk, sourced from locally grazed herds.  The concept behind production of Alter Schweizer was to create a cheese that resembles the traditional Swiss wheels produced several centuries ago. In other words, an original, rustically satisfying table cheese that can be stored for a very long time. Made from pasteurized, whole milk with the addition of animal rennet, Alter Schweizer is produced in the style of a Gruyere - although Studer actually uses cultures that differ from a classic Gruyere, without revealing which ones. After coagulation and as soon as the curd is in the forms, pressing takes place for approximately 24 hours. The wheels are then immersed in a salty brine bath for 48 hours before being transferred into the aging cellar. Cheeses are washed regularly with a brine solution during the first six months of their maturation and, depending on the season they were made and the characteristics of the milk used, are normally aged for at least ten months prior to release. The texture of Alter Schweizer is firm, dense and smooth, with richly complex flavors of toasted walnuts, brown butter with sweet barnyard aromas. Interestingly, even with the most aged wheels, when the interior becomes slightly brittle, flavors remain balanced, never becoming overly sharp or salty as can sometimes happen with other cheeses made in this style."

Their herd of Jersey, Normande, and Tarantaise cross cows are grazed through fresh pastures every day, and the dairy follows nature’s milking rhythm, operating on a seasonal basis.  In the mid-1990’s, the farm, run by Leslie Jacobs and Matthew Brichford, transitioned from raising beef cattle to dairying. In 2010, after years of studying cheesemaking, they built their cheese plant and sold their first cheese two years later. A family venture, Matthew Brichford manages the farm and makes the cheese, while Leslie Jacobs takes care of marketing with their daughter Maize and daughter Miah handles milking and grazing management.  Jacobs and Brichford follow a European influence with their cheeses, says Leslie Jacobs, and they wanted to meld those influences with something unique for Ameribella, which was released in June 2012. Inspired by the cheeses of Northern Italy, like Taleggio, Ameribella is a semi-soft, washed rind cheese with a salty and savory flavor. Ameribella is brick-shaped with a distinct orangey-pink rind, assertive aroma, and pliant pudgy interior.  After the curdling process, Ameribella is aged for a minimum of 60 days in a cool aging room. For the first 45 days, the block is wiped with a brine solution—giving it a distinct orange rind. It’s then wrapped in ripening papers and flipped for the next 15 days. After 60 days, it’s ready to be sold. According to Jacobs, blocks aged a bit longer—even up to four months—are the tastiest, though with high demand, Ameribella doesn’t tend to make it that long.On the nose, Ameribella has a pungent aroma reminiscent of yeasty bread. The golden-colored paste is doughy and scattered with eyes. On the palate, it’s savory, salty, and slightly lactic with assertive flavors of mustard and yeast. With age, the flavor sweetens, adding complexity, and the paste becomes runnier.Ameribella is full-flavored enough to eat alone or paired simply with crusty bread and charcuterie. It’s well-suited by crisp sides like slices of cucumber or pears. In cheesy dishes like risottos or macaroni and cheese, Ameribella adds a delicious complexity of flavor."

Errico comes from a family of cheese makers who have been producing Provolone in Italy for over a century. In 1979, he moved his family to the United States and opened his own Italian cheese company. Over the last thirty years, BelGioioso has grown to include seven manufacturing facilities in Northeastern Wisconsin. Using the milk of Wisconsin dairy farmers, the company produces over 25 types of cheese. However, each facility produces only a select few of these cheeses, thereby ensuring high quality and consistency. This has resulted in multiple awards, including several United States, World and American Cheese Society Awards. American Grana is based on the famous Grana Padano of Italy. Made from raw cow’s milk, it is aged for a minimum of 18 months in BelGoioso’s caves. During its maturation, the cheese is turned twice a week by hand to ensure even aging.As a result, this cheese’s light yellow paste and a hard, granular texture with a touch more moisture than Italian Grana Padano. The flavor of American Grana is of rich, roasted nuts and salty sharpness, which lingers on the tongue.This cheese has the perfect texture to grate over pasta dishes or salads, and can also be served with fresh green apples or grapes.

Expect sweet aromas, mild hits of salt and a bright, clean finish. Anabasque is made in Wisconsin at Landmark Creamery, which is run by a pair of Annas: Anna Landmark and Anna Thomas Bates. “This either makes things very confusing, or very simple,” they say. After meeting at a potluck for Green Country Women in Sustainable Agriculture in 2012, Landmark (who’d had a small sheep and goat farm) and Thomas Bates (a food writer) decided to form a partnership. Landmark is in charge of cheesemaking, while Thomas-Bates is in charge of sales. The Annas currently partner with two dairies to source milk, using space rented at Clock Shadow Creamery to produce their cheese. Sheep’s milk is sourced from Sam and Abe Enloe, a team of brothers in Rewey, Wisconsin. Cow’s milk is sourced from Bert Paris in Belleville, Wisconsin. Some wheels of Anabasque are cave-aged at Landmark Creamery for at least three months, while others are sent to one of Standard Market’s three aging caves in Illinoisfor ten months of maturation, which includes repeated washings with a light Brevibacterium linens solution that gives it an orangey tint over time.Pair it with fruity red wines, hard cider and Marcona almonds, or melt it into a butternut squash risotto.Head Cheesemonger Alyssa Stoneof Standard Market says that recent Illinoiscave-aged versions yield notes of strawberries, making for a delicious accompaniment to fresh figs."

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as some aged cheeses—including these semi-firm wheels of Caciotta. Produced with pasteurized goat’s milk sourced from different grade “A” farms in Texas and Oklahoma, Ancho Goat Caciotta is a Texas version of Monterey jack speckled with ancho chilies. Wheels are waxed and aged for one month. Other flavors include Traditional (plain) and Mexican Marigold Mint. Mozzarella Company also produces several other varieties using cow`s milk.With a sharp and goaty scent, Ancho Goat Caciotta has a creamy, sticky paste. Flavor is mild, with the chilies contributing more of a smoky herbal flavor than a spicy kick, and the goat’s milk calming the spice and bitterness, while adding a layer of complexity.Pair Ancho Goat Caciotta with a Tempranillo or with a Shiraz."

It relies on local dairies to provide the goat, cow, and buffalo milk used in their production. Head Cheesemaker Kris Lloyd oversees her passionate team of cheesemakers that includes her son, Mitch Wright.Together, these cheesemakers have produced cheeses that have won upwards of 100 awards since 2006. Although each cheese is made by hand using traditional methods, Wright strives to incorporate unusual Australian ingredients such as saltbush and lemon myrtle.Woodside’s creations are found throughout Australia and have garnered an international audience. Following FDA approval, one of its most unique cheeses is now available in the U.S. This fresh goat chevre was a Super Gold Medalist in the World Cheese Awards, and greatly impressed onlookers with its bold ingenuity. After a five-day maturation using a lactic fermentation process, the cheese is encased with native lemon myrtle and topped with whole green ants.These ants, known as gulguk to the Larrakia people who harvest them in Arnhem Land, are an excellent source of protein and offer a citrusy punch to any dish.

Appalachian,Meadow Creek Dairy,United States,Virginia,"9 ins square diameter, 3 ins high",8lbs,www.meadowcreekdairy.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Meadow Creek Dairy is a family farm located in the mountains of southwest Virginia. At an elevation of 2,800 feet, the combination of pure water, clean air, and deep soils produce an ideal environment for growing diverse, mineral-rich pastures. Rick and Helen Feete have been farming since 1980 and over the years have worked extremely hard, focusing their attention on constantly improving the genetics and milk quality of their herd of Jersey cows. Meadow Creek`s cheese production is resolutely seasonal. Milking begins in late March, when all the calves are born, to coincide with the new growth of grass. The cows are never confined and are born and raised on pasture, where they graze a diverse mixture of perennial grasses and legumes, supplemented with some grains, salt and Norwegian kelp. In the fall, when the grass declines, milk production naturally winds down too. Christmas Eve is the last day of the milking season and the beginning of a two month rest for the cows and the family. Made in the style of a French Tomme, Appalachian has a firm, supple texture that is a deep, straw-colored yellow. The natural rind is thin and brown-grey in color, similar to a Tomme de Savoie. The square-shaped wheels are aged for 90 days before release and flavors reflect the rich Jersey milk.Appalachian has distinct flavors of fruit (especially lemons), cream and butter with a delicate, smooth and velvety texture."
Appenzeller,Alois Pfister,Switzerland,Appenzell,"12-14 ins diameter, 3.5 ins high",15 lbs,,Cow,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,Animal,WashedNatural,Alpine-style,,"Produced near the town of Appenzell in northeastern Switzerland, Appenzeller is made from cow`s milk and has a history dating back more than 700 years. Appenzeller is a wonderful example of traditional, Swiss mountain cheesemaking at its best. There are now just three local cooperative dairies producing Appenzeller, and milk comes exclusively from the Simmenthaler breed of cow. Traditionally cheeses were only made using raw milk, however, the rules have become less stringent and now some dairies prefer to pasteurize. As with many Swiss mountain cheeses, once the curd is formed and cut, it is then reheated to a higher temperature to expel more whey from the solids, forming smaller pieces of curd in the process. The curd is then pressed while still in the vat, submerged under the whey before being transferred to molds for further pressing. After unmolding, wheels are moved to the maturing rooms where they are aged for 7-12 months. One of the distinctive steps in the maturing process of Appenzeller is that the young cheeses are regularly washed in a special solution of white wine, herbs, spices and occasionally herb brandy. This contributes greatly to the development of the rind and the flavor of the cheese. The texture of Appenzeller is firm, supple and very smooth, dotted with occasional holes or ""eyes."" The interior paste is ivory-white in color.Flavors are incredibly robust, rich and complex, including herbaceous, savory notes of flowers and grasses, accompanied by a rich, mineral tang. The sweetness of the milk provides a balance to all this, but the finish on the palate is long and memorable."
Apple Smoked Cheddar,Carr Valley Cheese Company,United States,Wisconsin,"10 ins diameter, 4 ins high",12lb,www.carrvalleycheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,FlavoredSmokedPaprika,Cheddar-like,Flavor added to rindSmoked,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties, as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Production of Apple Smoked cheddar begins with a traditional cheddar recipe. Finished, 12 lb. wheels are then smoked over applewood before being hand rubbed with paprika, which gives the cheeses their very distinct orange rind. The interior paste of the cheese is ivory-white and has a supple, moist texture that is classically that of a Wisconsin cheddar. Flavors show the sweetness of the milk and are balanced by light smoke with the spicyness imparted by the paprika."

Creamery owner Scott Linkletter was inspired to begin making cheddar-style cheeses after a visit to the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, where he met and befriended a local cheesemaker. Produced using a cheddar recipe that Linkletter discovered on that trip, this cheese reflects the salt air and iron-rich soils of Prince Edward Island. The Holstein cow’s milk used in production is gently heated but not pasteurized, allowing beneficial microbes to thrive and give depth of character and flavor to the cheese. This is a version of the creamery’s Extra Old Cheddar that is naturally smoked over an eight-hour period. During this time it’s wrapped in natural apple wood smoke, which produces a mouth-wateringly full, smoky flavor that beautifully compliments the award winning two-year-old cheddar.The subtle smoky smell of this cheddar reminds us of campfires, baked beans and burnt marshmallows. It’s firm and crumbly, especially for a smoked cheese, and its mild smoky background flavor doesn’t overshadow its characteristic cheddar flavors. Sweet and salty, it’s reminiscent of ham, bacon and good barbeque with the mildest implied spiciness.Pair it with a Bordeaux, a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Tempranillo."
Ardrahan,Ardrahan Dairy Products Ltd.,Ireland,Co. Cork,"7 ins diameter, 2-3 ins high",3 lbs,www.ardrahancheese.ie,Cow,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Based in Kanturk in Southern Ireland, the Burns family have been involved in dairy farming since 1925, when Eugene Burns established a herd of pedigree Friesian cows. Until 1983 the family sold the liquid milk from their herd. Then, inspired by a handful of other small daries that had turned to cheesemaking, Eugene`s son (also called Eugene) and his wife Mary began experimenting on their own. Ireland`s temperate and damp, maritime climate makes it ideal for the production of washed rind cheeses, however, it being early 1980`s Ireland, most people had not yet developed a taste for pungent farmstead cheeses, and initially Ardrahan found a much greater fan base with the French. Gradually sales strengthened, particularly in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and now the Burnses sell everything they make. For production of Ardrahan, milk is heated to 88°F, starter cultures and rennet are added, and after coagulation the curd is cut, put into molds and allowed to drain naturally. After unmolding, the young cheeses are brined for several hours before being transferred to the aging room, where they are matured for about four weeks. During this time they are washed with salt water to encourage the growth of the Bacterium Linens mold. This ripens the cheeses and gives Ardrahan its classic washed rind, breaking down the texture from chalky to smooth. The aromas of Ardrahan (like many washed rind cheeses) are much more pungent than the flavor of the cheese. The rind is orange-brown in color, with the occasional patch of white mold and has a soft, sticky texture. The interior is pale, butter yellow, dotted with small holes or slits, and is smooth and yielding.Flavors are complex and meaty with savory hints of earth, smoke, bacon and butter."

Award-winning Diva cheese is made at a Litchfield, Connecticut-based farm that’s been around since 1999. Its founders, George Malkemus and Anthony Yurgaitis, began by making milk—as well as breeding and raising show cows. Cheesemaking is a newer venture here, with a full-fledged creamery launched in 2011 and a repertoire that now includes nine different cheeses, plus yogurt, ice cream and butter. The farm opened its on-site restaurant, Arethusa al Tavolo, in 2013. The square-shaped cheese is washed periodically as it ages for 1-2 months.Exuding heady aromas of cooked onion and nuts, flavor is much milder than the smell suggests, with a balanced saltiness, sweet and slightly tangy.Pair it with a light-bodied, semi-dry red wine, a sour ale or a yeasty farmhouse ale."

Its name is derived from the Greek word for ""masculine,"" supposedly a nod to its strong, piquant flavor. Production of the cheese is similar to that of Kefalotyri. Traditionally it was made from a mixture of raw goat`s and sheep`s milks, however in modern times pasteurized versions made with added cow`s milk are also available. After rennet is used to coagulate the milk, cheesemakers cut the curd into corn kernel-sized pieces and then scald the curds in their whey before packing them into cylindrical molds by hand. Beginning the next day, the wheels are brined for 48 hours and then ripened for at least 30 days. Sometimes, the wheels are stored in olive oil or rubbed in the mash left over from the olive-oil making process.Pleasantly salty and rich, expect a kick of piquancy from this rustic wheel.Fry a wedge of Arseniko up in a pan to make saganaki, or serve it as a table cheese alongside a bright white wine from Greece, such as a Treis Treis Parades.

Arzúa Ulloa is available in either farmstead or industrial versions, although the farmstead varieties are hard to find, usually only sold at local markets. It is one of the classic, traditional cheeses of Galicia and also one of the most produced and consumed varieties. Arzúa Ulloa`s wider fan base is largely thanks to its protected name and the effect of the cheese fair at Arzúa, both of which have given the cheese a certain notoriety and helped to support an expanded number of artisan dairies along the shores of the Ulloa river. For production, milk is heated to 91.4°F, coagulated with traditional rennet, and the curd is cut. Salt is added and the curds are transferred into molds, where they drain naturally, retaining much of the moisture of the curd. After unmolding, the cheeses are moved to maturing rooms where they receive a regular oil rub during the remaining period of 15 days. The rind of Arzúa Ulloa is smooth, pliable and waxy. It is pale yellow in color and dotted with sporadic blue or white mold spots. The interior paste is an ivory color, and has a smooth, velvety texture dotted with occasional holes or ""eyes"".Aromas are reminiscent of a cheesemaking room - fresh, lactic and pleasantly sour.

Spring Brook is a farm with a mission; parent organization Farms for City Kids offers on-site agricultural education programs for urban youth. And thanks to its expanding product line of award-winning cheeses and partnerships with local dairies, the farm is a boon to the local economy, too.   Ashbrook—originally called Ashlyn but renamed to avoid confusion with a Canadian goat’s milk cheese—is an instant star. Recipe development began in early 2014, with wheels hitting the market later that year. The washed-rind wheel is based loosely on French Morbier with a New England terroir twist. Sister to wildly popular Reading and Tarentaise cheeses, Ashbrook is made with high-quality milk from two small area dairies, Fox Valley Farm and Jericho Hill Farm, and aged for about three months.Aromatic of damp, dark cellar with mild funk, its orange rind encloses milky, sweet paste with a wispy layer of vegetable ash running through the middle.Consider texture and acidity: Green peppers and other crunchy veggies and fruits with bright flavors are fresh foils for this pungent cheese.

Asher Blue,Sweet Grass Dairy,United States,Georgia,"8 ins diameter,  3ins high",3 lbs,www.sweetgrassdairy.com,Cow,,BlueFirm,Microbial,Natural,Blue,,"Founded by Al and Desiree Wehner in 2000, Sweet Grass Dairy is steeped in dairy farming tradition. Since their arrival in the US from Germany, successive generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay. For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats. Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition. Named after Desiree`s middle child, Asher Blue is made from raw cow`s milk and has a dense, smooth paste shot through with blue-green veins against a bone-white background.Flavors are richly robust and tangy with notes of salt, milk and grass."

In 2000, after some experimental cheesemaking at home, Birgit enlisted the help of her father, Franz, a master cheesemaker from Germany. Today, MouCo Cheese Company produces four types of soft cheese: MouCo Camembert, ColoRouge, Ashley and Truffello. Pasteurized milk, predominantly from Holstein cows, is sourced from Morning Fresh Dairy, located just outside Fort Collins. For production of Ashley, milk is heated and the cultures and rennet added. After coagulation, the curd is carefully ladled into molds to preserve as much moisture as possible, and allowed to drain. After a few hours, the cheeses are unmolded and coated in a blend of salt and vegetable ash which helps begin the development of the rind. The young cheeses are then transferred to racks and dried slightly before being moved to the maturing cave where they’re aged for an initial period of eleven days before being matured for a further forty in their packaging.With a gently undulating, wrinkly, grey rind, the texture of Ashley is soft and yielding. Flavors are fresh, bright and clean with notes of citrus and mushrooms.Good beverage pairings for Ashley include beers such as lagers, saisons and chocolate stouts.

Asiago d'Allevo,Various,Italy,Veneto,"12-16 in. diameter, 5 in. high",15 lbs,,Cow,Raw,FirmHard,Animal,Natural,Cheddar-like,,"Made from raw cow`s milk, Asiago is named for the Asiago plateau in northern Italy`s Veneto mountains. According to its DOP designation,which protects the use of its name, Asiago can only be produced within officially recognized areas near the town of Asiago in the Provinces of Vicenza and Trento. Asiago is available in two types: Asiago Pressato (made with milk from the low lying areas, it`s semi-soft, with large holes) and Asiago d`Allevo. Asiago d`Allevo is a semi-hard cheese with a firm texture and a straw-colored paste. Asiago d`Allevo is produced using raw milk from the Pezzata Nera and Bruno Alpina cows that graze in the higher mountain pastures. Cheeses are made in either small mountain dairies or in the larger facilities where the cheeses are collectively matured. In either case, the cooperative dairies that provide the milk ensure the quality of milk suited for cheese production. It is generally acknowledged that the best milk for cheesemaking comes from cows that graze on higher Alpine pastures during the summer months, when there is alarge variety of grasses, herbs,and flowers. To make Asiago d`Allevo,the raw milk is allowed to rest for 6-12 hours, and the cream that rises to the top is skimmed off. The milk is heated and rennet is added, and then coagulation takes place at 95°F, lasting between 25-30 minutes. The curd is cut and reheated twice (first to a temperature of 104°F and then 116°F) in order to expel more whey. The curds are scooped into the molds for pressing, during which time they receive their DOP stamp on the rind. After unmolding, wheels are either brined or dry salted before being moved to the maturing rooms for aging. Asiago d`Allevo is produced in large, flat wheels weighing approximately 15 lbs. and is sold at varying ages.The age of the cheese denotes its flavor profile. In younger ""Mezzano""cheeses, aged for a minimum of three months, flavors are fresh, mild, and lactic. The texture is supple, semisoft, and even throughout, with a pale straw-colored interior dotted with occasional small holes. Cheeses matured for at least nine months are known as ""Vecchio"" or ""Stravecchio"" and have a much firmer, drier texture that makes them well-suited for grating. With age, flavors become more intense and piquant.An excellent table cheese, Asiago is delicious on its own, or grate it onto pasta, salad, and soup as a finishing touch. It`s a versatile cheese for drink pairings. For wines, tryrioja, sauvignonblanc, shiraz, and zinfandel. For beer, opt for IPAs, nutty brown ales, Belgianales, or porters."

Primarily renowned for their production of hard and Italian style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facilities. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. Made in the style of its eponymous cousin, Sartori’s Asiago is mild-tasting, with hints of nuts and sweet cream. Aromas are slightly pungent without being assertive. This cheese has a multitude of uses in the kitchen and also pairs well with cured sausages, artisan breads and olives.Successful wine pairings include Shiraz, Chianti, Riesling and Beaujolais. Beers such as a Trappist Style Ale or American IPA work well."

In 2012, with some help from local grants and organizations, the couple built Tomales Farmstead Creamery and began making cheese. Today the repertoire includes goat, sheep, and mixed-milk cheeses, made using farmstead milk from Toluma’s 100 East Friesian sheep and 200 goats. Creamy Jersey cow’s milk is also sometimes used, sourced from a neighbor’s farm two miles down the road. Like all of the Marin County-based creamery’s cheeses, this one’s name, which translates to “woman,” draws from the language of the coastal region’s original inhabitants: the Miwok. “From everything we’ve come to learn about this tribe we know they took excellent care of the land,” says Hicks. “Since we have so many school age tours, we wanted to educate people about those who lived on this land and had such great respect for it—and also teach some of the few words that are still known.” These rustic little goat’s milk wheels are aged from six to nine months, during which they’re washed in a solution of cultures and brine every couple of weeks. Before sale, they undergo a final washing in chardonnay from California’s Balletto Vineyards.With a flaky, dense paste surrounded by a smooth stony rind, Assa is goaty on the nose with hints of minerals, yogurt and wine.

In 2012, with some help from local grants and organizations, the couple built Tomales Farmstead Creamery and began making cheese. Today the repertoire includes goat, sheep, and mixed-milk cheeses, made using farmstead milk from Toluma’s 100-plus East Friesian sheep and 200-plus goats. Creamy Jersey cow’s milk, sourced from a neighbor’s farm two miles down the road, is also sometimes used. Like all of the Marin County-based creamery’s cheeses, this one’s name, which translates to “two,” draws from the language of the coastal region’s original inhabitants: the Miwok. “From everything we’ve come to learn about this tribe we know they took excellent care of the land,” says Hicks. “Since we have so many school age tours, we wanted to educate people about those who lived on this land and had such great respect for it—and also teach some of the few words that are still known.” As its name implies, Atika is made from a mix of two different milks: goat and sheep. The rustic little wheels are aged from six to nine months, washed in a solution of cultures and brine every couple of weeks. Before sale, they undergo a final washing in chardonnay from California’s Balletto Vineyards.A gorgeous ridged, mottled rind surrounds a flaky paste, yellow-white paste that easily breaks into shards. Initial aromas of buttered wheat toast, wildflowers and sour cream give way to flavors of roasted almonds and sweet cream.Pair Assa with Balletto Vineyards or another Chardonnay—or simply serve with fruit (apples, fig jam, persimmons or quince paste)."

Errico comes from a family of cheese makers who have been producing Provolone in Italy for over a century. In 1979, he moved his family to the United States and opened his own Italian cheese company. Over the last thirty years, BelGioioso has grown to include seven manufacturing facilities in Northeastern Wisconsin. Using the milk of Wisconsin dairy farmers, the company produces over 25 types of cheese. However, each facility produces only a select few of these cheeses, thereby ensuring high quality and consistency. This has resulted in multiple awards, including several United States, World Cheese Championship, and American Cheese Society Awards. Auribella is a raw cow’s milk cheese that is aged for at least 6 months. During that time, the cheese develops a crumbly texture. It has a clean, fresh aroma and a cream-colored rind and paste. The flavor is robust and sharp.This cheese is best crumbled into salads or served with fruit as a dessert or snack. It pairs very well with robust red wines such as Chianti or Merlot, and ciders."

Milk is sourced from the closed herd of native Murciana goats that are kept on the estate which is also where the cheesemaking takes place. Simona, the cheesemaker, uses rennet derived from locally grown thistles to coagulate the milk and then, once the cheeses are made, ages them in her underground cave for 60 days before release.In terms of texture, the cheese changes depending on the season and its age. At times the texture is cream-like, soft and pliant whereas at other times it can be drier and more flaky. Cheeses have bright flavors of citrus, herbs and grass."

Owned by the Geissbuhler family in southern Wisconsin since the early part of the 20th century, Brunkow Cheese has been known for many years for the production of classic Wisconsin-type cheddars. However, in 2006 they decided to launch a secondary range of artisanal-style cheeses based on several well-known English varieties. The inspiration for this came from their local area, which was originally settled by the English. Milk for production comes from a small number of local dairies, many of which have worked with the Giessbuhlers for several decades. The Avondale Truckle is based on a traditional recipe for English-style cheddars and after production are wrapped in cheese cloth and coated with lard. Wheels are aged in the Brunkow cellars for up to 18 months before being released for sale.When young, the cheeses possess a buttery, tangy quality that smooths out with age, developing more subtle complex notes of hay, grass and savory, earthy, vegetal notes.Avondale Truckle pairs best with a beer or a fairly hefty red wine that will stand up to its robust flavors."
Avonlea Clothbound,Cows Creamery,Canada,Prince Edward Island,12 in diameter x 12 in height,22 lbs,www.cowscreamery.ca,Cow,Raw,Hard,Vegetable,Cloth Wrapped,Cheddar-like,,"CowsCreamery is located on Canada’s east cost, in the capital city of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown. Creamery owner Scott Linkletter was inspired to begin making cheddar-style cheeses after a visit to the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, where he met and befriended a local cheesemaker. Produced using a cheddar recipe that Linkletter discovered on that trip, this cheese reflects the salt air and iron-rich soils of Prince Edward Island. The Holstein cow’s milk used in production is gently heated but not pasteurized, allowing beneficial microbes to thrive and give depth of character and flavor to the cheese. The cloth, which is applied to the exterior of the wheels, allows the cheese to breathe during 6-12 months of aging at 50-54 degrees F and 90% humidity.Caramel-covered and firm, this fudgy cheddar exhibits a texture that’s amazingly smooth for a clothbound. Aromas are mild and mineraly with notes of butterscotch and caramel sauce. Not the least bit sharp, flavor is sweet and well rounded with background aromas of tomato and peanut butter. Aftertaste is sweet and milky with notes of brown butter and a tangy bite.The warmer this cheese gets, the more savory it becomes. Serve at room temperature alongside a pinot noir or Gewurztraminer, or wedge it into a grilled cheese sandwich."
Azeitão,Various,Portugal,Arrabida Mountains,"2-3 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",6-8oz,,Sheep,Raw,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,CrèmeWashed-Rind,,"Made from raw sheep`s milk, Azeitão is produced by a small number of farmhouse dairies in the Arrábida Mountains of southern Portugal. The origins of Azeitão can be traced to Serra da Estrela, another cheese made in northern Portugal. Cheesemakers from that area brought their skills and traditions to the Azeitão, Setubal, Palmela, and Sesimbra regions where Azeitão is made and has a protected designation of origin (or PDO).  The milk for Azeitão is coagulated using a vegetable-based rennet made from the stamens of the cardoon thistle flower. This is unusual, especially today when the majority of commercial cheesemakers use either an animal-based rennet or one that has been synthetically produced. The use of thistle rennet is traditional in some Mediterranean regions, however it is much more challenging for the cheesemaker to use, and makes it difficult to produce a consistent cheese - another reason for its decline.  Although Azeitão is made year round, the best season for production tends to be between April and August when the sheep are grazing on the summer vegetation. There is frequently a shortage of cheese in September and October.The texture of Azeitão is smooth and velvety when ripe, becoming harder and drier as the cheese ages. The rind is a rust-brown-color, sometimes dotted with patches of white mold. The interior paste is ivory-white and yielding.  Aromas can be fairly pungent and sheepy - characteristics that continue into the flavor of the cheese. Azeitão, like other cheeses that are coagulated with thistle rennet, tends to have a unique, slightly sour (sometimes verging on bitter) taste.  While this might sound unpleasant, these flavors are balanced by the sweetness of the sheep`s milk and herbaceous, savory and vegetal notes.Because of Azeitão’s strong personality, it`s best paired with more moderate flavors. Sweet white wines from the same region or medium-bodied red wines with low tannin levels pair beautifully with it."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Made exlusively from sheep’s milk sourced in Wisconsin, Ba Ba Blue is aged for four months prior to release for sale.The texture of this cheese is semi-soft and slightly crumbly. The interior paste is bone white in color, shot through with deep blue parsleyed veins.

Baby Swiss (Boggy Meadow),Boggy Meadow Farm,United States,New Hampshire,12 in length x 5 in width,5 lbs,www.boggymeadowfarm.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Baby Swiss is produced at Boggy Meadow Farm, located in a stunningly beautiful area on the banks of the Connecticut River in New Hampshire. There has been a farm on the site for centuries, and a dairy farm for as long as anyone can remember, but it is only in the last few years that cheese has been made there.?? Records show that Jonathan Mason, a retired United States Senator from Massachusetts, purchased Boggy Meadow Farm in 1822, and the 400 acre farm has been owned and operated by his descendants ever since. Milk for production comes from the farm`s own herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows.?? Smoked Baby Swiss is made once a week in the creamery, which is located in the converted 18th century barn and farmhouse across from the dairy parlor. “The interesting aspect of ‘Swiss’ cheese,” says owner Marcus Lovell-Smith, “ is that no salt is added to the curd—the only additives are the bacteria and the rennet, which makes the cheese a ‘pure’ derivation of the original raw milk.” The cheese is made using a washed-curd technique; halfway through the process the curds are washed with fresh water to reduce the acidity. Lovell-Smith says that this step, along with the use of whole milk instead of skim milk in production, contributes to the cheese’s richness and creaminess. After, the cheese is aged until the cheese until its “eyes” form (the characteristic holes created by the propionic acid bacteria).Baby Swiss has a soft, smooth and springy texture, with upfront aromas of hay, grass and sweet cream. Flavor is mild and approachable, with a buttery start and a slightly sharp aftertaste.Pair it with a pilsner, a Pinot Blanc or with Boggy Meadow Farm’s own Switchel Cider Vodka."

Brenda and her husband, Dean, live in the heart of Amish country. They own 76 acres of land, 30 of which are allocated to grazing for their 116 Lacaune and East Friesian dairy sheep. Brenda & Dean started with a small dairy herd and have both worked hard to improve genetics and milk quality. Friesians produce a good yield of milk and have very calm temperaments, while Lacaunes bring higher fat and protein into the mix. The vision for Hidden Springs Farm and Creamery is to be sustainable - both environmentally and financially. Since the Jensens are in the middle of Amish farm country (Dean works as a councillor for the Amish community), they appreciate Amish values and work practices. They employ Amish friends and neighbors for milking and construction. Percheron draft horses - not tractors - plow their fields, and donkeys keep coyotes and other predators away from their lambs. Brenda has worked to develop several cheeses. Driftless was her first fresh cheese and she has since added aged cheeses; O`Cooch Mountain, Feta, and the semi-aged Bad Axe to the range. Bad Axe cheese is named after a river near the farm that was the original site of the 1832 Battle of Bad Axe. Aged for 60 days, and then dipped into wax to help retain moisture, Bad axe has a pure, creamy white paste and floral aroma. Flavors are of fresh milk with a tart and a lingering tang. The cheese slightly resembles a fresh mozzarella with its taste and smooth texture."
Balsamic BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,Cheddar-like,,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing. This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings. Balsamic BellaVitano is immersed in a 6-year-old Italian balsamic vinegar and aged further to allow the light and fruity notes of the cheese to marry with the sweet and tangy vinegar.The final product is characterized by a tangy, brown-purple rind and a paste that’s sweet and earthy with only a hint of vinegar flavor. Any overwhelming acidity is counterbalanced with a subtle sweetness, and fruity tones of cherry and raisins permeate throughout.Pair Reserve Balsamic BellaVitano with a Chardonnay, a Pinot Noir, an Asti Spumanti or a Sherry. For beer pairings, try Weizen, Weizenbock, Smoked Porters or Pale Ales."

Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successibe generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay. For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats. Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition. Balsamic Goat is an aged, raw goat`s milk cheese washed in balsamic vinegar.

Banon,Various,France,"Banon, Provence",3 ins diameter  1 in high,2-4 oz,,SheepGoat,,Soft,Animal,Leaf WrappedWashed,Fresh,,"Named after the market town, just north of Aix in southern France, production of Banontakes place throughout Provence. Granted AOC (name protected) status in 2003, the AOC rules state that Banon can be produced using whole, raw sheep`s and/or goat`s milk. Production of Banon requires fairly rapid coagulation of the milk, a part of the process that originated due to the hot climate of the region. Within a few hours of renneting, the curd is cut and gently ladled into molds. Cheeses are turned several times within the first 12 hours, are unmolded after 24 hours, and are salted and dried for five to ten days before being encased inside four or more chestnut leaves. The leaves are gathered in the autumn when they have fallen off the trees, and are held in place around the cheese with raffia. Some Banon producers sprinkle their cheeses with pepper, summer savory, thyme or bay leaves. Occasionally the leaves and raffia are dipped in vinegar or eau-de-vie, which has the effect of sterilizing them as well as imparting flavor. Banon must be matured for a minimum of two weeks. However, with further aging they become soft and sticky, often adhering to the chestnut leaves, and acquire a stronger, more intense flavor.With the protection of the chestnut leaves, the Banon inside remains soft and pliable. Unwrapping these little parcels reveals a rindless, often sticky and moldy cheese that smells vegetal, goaty, yeasty, and savory all at the same time.Flavors are complex and full, and therefore the best accompaniment is often a simple crusty baguette and a glass of dry white wine."

Created in 2006, this was among the first cheeses released at Beehive Cheese Company, one of Utah`s few artisanal cheesemakers. Founded and built from the ground-up by brothers Tim Welsh and Pat Ford near Uintah, the creamery specializes in unique twists on cheddar styles, sourcing milk from Wade`s dairy, a fourth-generation family farm just 10 miles away. The concept for Barely Buzzed was arrived at somewhat randomly. Tim Welsh’s brother owns a company in Grand Junction, Colorado, called Colorado Legacy Fine Coffee; Beehive sells bags of the beans in their store. One day they decided to experiment by applying the roasted coffee blended with lavender on cheese wheels. After tweaking several times, the brothers began getting positive feedback from family, friends, and some American Cheese Society (ACS) judges. They submitted Barely Buzzed to the ACS competition in 2007 and won a first-place ribbon—and the rest was history. To make the cheese, one-day-old wheels are hand-rubbed with the “Beehive Blend” of lavender together with a mix of South American, Central American, and Indonesian coffee beans. After the rub is applied, wheel are aged approximately eight months.Flavors of Barely Buzzed are more subtle than one might expect with notes of butterscotch and caramel and a rich, full-bodied and smooth texture.Pair a wedge of Barely Buzzed with a cup o` Joe.

To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Barilotto, which means “barrel” in Italian, is made by heating leftover whey from the production of buffalo mozzarella. When the whey is re-cooked at a higher temperature, any remaining curds or solids rise to the surface. There, they are skimmed off and placed into small barrel-shaped molds where they are left to drain for 8 days. After unmolding, the cheeses are then sprinkled with salt and left to age in a cellar for 40 days where they are washed and rotated frequently by hand to allow even drying. After being branded with the company’s castle logo, the cheese is vacuum-packed to maintain moisture levels within the cheese.Barilotto has a firm texture with an ivory colored, fine, smooth interior paste that breaks in a similar way to chocolate when cut. Flavors are mild and delicate with intense fresh cream aromas and flavor.Its subtle sweetness suggests a light honey or jelly as an accompaniment."

Two Hoots` first foray into cheesemaking was abloomy rind cheese called Barkham Brie—but it`s blue cheeses that have become their focus, calling to mind Sandy`s upbringing on her parents` dairy farm.There, her dad milked Channel Island milk from Jersey and Guernsey cows. Now, Two Hoots uses that Channel Island milk for their blue cheeses like Barkham Blue. To make Barkham Blue, the Rosesheat the milk and add starter cultures and blue mold. When it reaches the correct temperature, they add rennet, let the cut set, and cut the curd into small cubes before draining off the whey. After they drain off the whey, they place the curds in molds that give Barkham Blue its striated exterior and let them drain further. When the cheeses are fully formed, the cheesemakers place them into a brine bath. Finally, they pierce the wheels to allow oxygen into the cheese and give the blue mold space to grow. The wheels are then aged in a maturing room, where they`re turnedregularly as a rustic rind forms. Following Barkham Blue`s success, Two Hoots has since introduced a petite version called Baby Barkham, as well as another blue called Rosethorn Blue.Barkham Blue develops a moist,deep yellow interior that’s punctuated with dark blue-green veins.

In order to reflect the bounty of the seasons while being stewards of the land, the farm practices rotational grazing of herds of Jersey cows, East Friesian sheep, and Saanen and Nubian dairy goats. Produced year round, Barn Owl is a pungent and richly-textured, washed-rind cheese. Similar to a brie in shape, the rind of Barn Owl is a subtle mix of beige, white and yellow - reminiscent of barn owl feathers in terms of color. When young, the rind is slightly sticky due to repeated washings, but with age a secondary geotricum mold develops as a result of being cave aged. The interior texture is semi soft and a pale golden yellow color.With a subtle aroma of mushrooms, flavors include butter and citrus notes with a lactic, mellow finish.Barn Owl pairs well with sparkling wines that have high residual sugar, dessert wines, and fruitier red wines. It also goes well with sweet ciders, and fuller bodied malty beers."

The history of the company dates back to the early 1900s, when Ernesto Carpenedo began working as a “casoin” (a word in local dialect for a cheesemonger) in a shop in the village of Preganziol. Ernesto eventually founded his own company, which is today run by his son Antonio and his grandsons Ernesto and Alessandro, who have over thirty years of experience in the dairy-cheese sector. Antonio has been devoting his attention to affinage since 1976, the year that he began steeping his first rounds of cheese in wine, giving birth to La Casearia’s signature Ubriaco (which translates into “drunken”).  Baronerosso, is a pressed, uncooked goat’s milk cheese with a wine-washed rind. Aged for a minimum of 5 months, wheels are immersed in Barbera d’Asti DOCG wine and marc for several weeks during the aging process.Baronerosso has a white, slightly crumbly paste and a dark purple red rind.

Jasper Hill is located in the beautiful, rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont. When they bought the farm, it was extremely run-down, but in 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 45 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. Andy is largely responsible for the management of the pasture and the herd, which grazes from late spring to early fall. Over the years he has improved the grazing land at Jasper Hill by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. Mateo focuses on the cheese production, and Jasper Hill`s range includes Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Caspian, Moses Sleeper and Winnimere. Originally based on the recipe for Wensleydale, Bartlett Blue is made seasonally during the summer months when it switches out with Jasper Hill`s Vacherin-style Winnimere. Bartlett Blue is produced from fresh, uncooled evening milk that is pumped directly from the milking parlor into the cheesemaking room. The texture of Bartlett is more dense than most blues, having an almost cheddar like consistency - a result of the Wensleydale recipe. the ivory colored paste is shot through with blue-green veins that have a greater concentration near the center of the wheel. The natural rind is pale beige in color overlaid with patches of white. Flavors are savory and sweet with notes of cream and butter. Like many blue cheeses, Bartlett Blue is a wonderful match for dessert wines."

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, such as the Mascarpone used in this flavored cheese. To create the Mascarpone Torta, Paula and her team layer their fresh Mascarpone with various fillings--in this case, a basil pesto with toasted pine nuts. Flavorings in other versions of the torta include ancho chiles, sundried tomatoes and pecans with praline.Basil Pesto Mascarpone Torta has a texture that’s creamy and soft to the touch, with a strong and earthy basil scent. The pesto flavor dominates, with subtle flavors of garlic and pepper detectable, however the mascarpone balances out these stronger flavors quite well, adding a rich, bright creaminess.Pair this cheese with a Sauvignon Blanc or a vintage Bordeaux."

Both formerly from Manhattan, Karen and Paul bought the farm in 1990, and now run a flock of 120 East Friesian milking sheep on the property. The sheep are rotationally grazed and moved to fresh pasture every 24 hours. Karen and Paul have worked hard to develop and manage the grazing, providing a wide variety of forage such as clovers, fescue, trefoil, wild oregano, timothy and cattails to enhance the animals` diet and improve milk quality. In addition to cheesemaking, Karen and Paul also sell their lambs, wool and soaps at a number of Farmers Markets that they regularly attend. During the season which runs from April to September, the sheep are milked twice each day. Every morning, Karen combines cooled milk from the previous evening`s milking with the warm, fresh milk from the morning`s milking to make cheese. Karen makes a variety of cheeses, as well as a sheep`s milk yogurt. The cheeses include the camembert-style Shushan Snow, Feta, and two versions of an aged, Basque-style sheep`s milk cheese called Battenkill Brebis, one of which is smoked and called Frere Fumant. Battenkill Brebis is made from raw milk. Milk is heated to 86°F and a mesophilic starter culture and traditional calf rennet are added. After the curds are formed, they are placed into cloth-lined cheese molds (the cloth leaves small indentations in the rind of the cheese that help the desirable molds to adhere and grow on the cheese aiding maturation). After pressing, the young Battenkills are brined for 24 hours and then transferred to the maturing cave underneath the main house. Wheels are aged for a minimum of four months, and some are held for up to 18 months prior to release. The texture is smooth, firm and dense, and pale, golden-ivory in color. Flavors are sweet, herbaceous and rich with savory vegetal notes and hints of almonds and hay."

Bay Blue,Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co,United States,California,"6 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",6 lbs,pointreyescheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"As farmers and ranchers, the Giacomini family have had a presence in Point Reyes for many decades. A descendant of Italian mountain dairy producers, Bob Giacomini began milking cows on his Point Reyes dairy in 1959. The dairy is near Point Reyes Station, just an hour north of San Francisco on America’s west coast. It is a stunningly beautiful location with a temperate climate, influenced by the salty air that comes straight off the Point Reyes National Seashore and the Pacific ocean Over the years, Bob and his wife Dean, together with their four daughters, Karen, Diana, Lynn and Jill, developed a shared vision of producing an all-natural farmstead cheese. This dream was realized in August, 2000, when they founded Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company and produced the first vat of their first cheese, Original Blue. Milk for production of all the Giacomini`s cheeses comes from their own closed herd of Holstein cows that graze the pastures overlooking Tomales Bay. Production for Bay Blue begins at 3:30am when milk is pumped to the cheese room in time for the morning`s cheesemaking. There, it is pasteurized and after the wheels are formed, cheeses are allowed to sit in their molds overnight. The following day, after unmolding, cheeses are hand-salted over a three day period before being pierced on the fourth day. They are then taken to the curing room for about three weeks where they are cradled in a vertical position on racks, each wheel being rotated a quarter turn each day. This ensures that the butterfat is evenly distributed throughout the cheese. In the early stages of their three month maturation, each wheel is pierced with stainless steel needles. This allows the air into the cheese, where it reacts with the enzymes and bacteria and causes the development of the blue veining.A naturally rinded cheese, Bay Blue was created with Stilton in mind. The interior texture is fudgy and slightly crumbly, punctuated with blue-green veining throughout the paste. Flavors and aromas of of earth and mushrooms combine with a gentle hint of salty caramel, reflecting the coastal environment where the cheese is made.Bay Blue is perfect for pairing with a glass of vintage Port or barrel-aged Scotch. In the kitchen, Bay Blue is a great topper for a succulent steak or burger, shaved onto poached pears or grilled peaches or melted into mushroom risotto."
Bayley Hazen Blue,Jasper Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,10 in height x 8 in diameter,7 lbs,www.jasperhillfarm.com,Cow,Raw,BlueFirm,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Bayley Hazen Blue is named for an old military road which traverses the Northeast Kingdom. The road was commissioned by George Washington and built to carry troops to fight the English on the Canadian front. Though no battle ever took place, the road brought the first settlers to Greensboro and is still in use today.  Bayley Hazen Blue is a buttery, natural-rinded cow`s milk blue cheese, made primarily with morning milk, which tends to be lower in fat. Production takes place every other day. Mateo Kehler, managing member at Jasper Hill, developed the recipe by starting with a Devon Blue recipe from England, changing its shape, and aging it between 2 and 3 months to end up with a stable rind that will hold up under typical retail conditions.   Bayley Hazen`s texture is firm and slightly drier than many blues. Its interior paste is cream colored and punctuated by blue-green pockets and veins.  Located in the rolling countryside of Greensboro, Vermont; Jasper Hill Farm was bought by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler in 1998. When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, Andy and Mateo had acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers.   Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking, due to mid-range fat and protein content. The way the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years, the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses, and legumes that enhance the flavor of the milk. Thanks to careful management and a focus on building good genetics, the herd is now among the highest milking quality in the United States.   In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, cheese maturing caves comprised of 22,000 square feet, were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s cheeses, but also to mature the cheeses of several Vermont-based producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Constant Bliss, Harbison, Moses Sleeper, and Winnimere.Flavors are complex and multi-layered. The typical tang of the blue mold, Penicillium Roqueforti, takes a back seat to a wide array of flavors that include butter, chocolate, and occasionally licorice.Bayley Hazen Blue is a versatile blue cheese that pairs well with tart and fruity flavors or deep and rich notes. Try it crumbled on a spinach salad, melted over a burger, or paired simply with a chunk of dark chocolate. To drink, either a fruity red wine or an Imperial Stout would be an excellent partner."
Bear Hill,Grafton Village Cheese,United States,Vermont,Various,Various,www.graftonvillagecheese.com,Sheep,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Washed,Alpine-styleWashed-Rind,,"The Grafton Village Cheese Company was founded in 1892 as the Grafton Cooperative Cheese Company, which converted surplus milk from local dairy farmers into cheese. Years later, a fire destroyed the original factory. When the nonprofit Windham Foundation restored the company in the mid 1960s, anew era for the town was born. Today, Grafton Cheese handcrafts artisanal, aged cheddar and specialty cheeses that are recognized for quality and taste on a worldwide scale. Proceeds from the sale of these cheeses support the Windham Foundation’s charitable efforts. Named for the bluff overlooking Grafton Village’s cheesemaking headquarters in Vermont, Bear Hill is truly an American original – a washed rind, Alpine style sheep`s milk cheese. Loosely following the make processes of continental cheeses like Emmentaler and Gouda, Bear Hill begins with 100% sheep’s milk – but the similarities end when the fresh cheese is taken out of the hoop, dry-salted, and washed with a bacteria and yeast solution. As Bear Hill ages for seven to eight months, washings occur less and less frequently, while flavor grows more and more complex.The cheese is mild as far as washed rinds go, but that’s not to say this cheese doesn’t do a lot of talking. Firm yet pliant, flavors are sweet, fruity, and nutty with a long, savory finish. Bear Hill delivers the sweetness of sheep’s milk without any barnyard aromas.Bear Hill can pair beautifully with many different beers. Try a malty beer with a little hop, like Otter Creek’s Oktoberfest. For wine pairings, try an Alsace Riesling, a Pinot Blanc, or a Gruner Veltliner."
Bearded Lady,Prodigal Farm,United States,North Carolina,,,prodigalfarm.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold RipenedBlue,BlueSoft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"What’s the secret to delicious goat’s milk cheese? Keeping goats happy, according to Prodigal Farm’s owners Dave Krabbe and Kathryn Spann. The Rougemont, N.C.-based farmstead dairy prides itself on being a place “where goats can be goats”; does are pasture-raised and moved to fresh patches of grass every few days. Krabbe and Spann follow the herd with a portable shelter (sometimes a school bus) in case any goats need some R&R during daily excursions. And the does love to be brought to the edge of the woods to “browse” the vines and pines, an interest that Krabbe and Spann are happy to indulge.  Bearded Lady is a lactic cheese inoculated with wrinky rind-creating Geotrichum candidum spores and rubbed with a mix of ash and Penicillium roqueforti, a blue mold, before aging. As the cheese matures, blue and while molds flourish on the surface, creating a mottled surface that reminds Spann of the growth of a forest. “There’s a succession as the forest grows up,” she says. “First certain plants come in, and then other plants come in, and the trees grow and they shade out the original plants so those can’t grow anymore—that’s analogous to the succession on a rind.” Smells of fresh mushrooms, with strong flavors of vanilla and minerals, mild yeasty notes, and a lemon finish. Reminds us a bit of marshmallows."
Beaufort PDO,Various,France,Haute-Savoie,"24 ins diameter, 6 ins high",80-130 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Produced in the Haute-Savoie region of France—an area highly regarded for superior pasture during the summer months—Beaufort is one of the most famous Alpine cheeses, a massive wheel that clocks in at an impressive 80 to 130 pounds. References to its production date back over 2,000 years, to before the Roman occupation of France. Government legislation finally caught up in 1976 when Beaufort was granted AOC (name protected) status—now, it`s protected with an EU-wide PDO.Three versions of Beaufort are produced: Beaufort, Beaufort d`Eté (summer Beaufort) and Beaufort d`Alpage, which is made in high-mountain huts during summer. Milk for production comes from a multitude of small farms. The majority is sourced from Tarantaise cows, an ancient mountain breed, with the remainder coming from the Abondance breed. It takes the milk of approximately 45 cows and two milkings to make just one wheel. To produce Beaufort, makers heat milk to between 89 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit before adding traditional animal rennet and letting it coagulate over 30 minutes. The curd is cut into wheat-size grains, which are slowly stirred for 10 to 15 minutes before being ""scalded,"" reheated again to a temperature not exceeding 133 degrees Fahrenheit. (This process expels more whey from the curds but leaves enough moisture so that they don`t dry out.) The curds are then scooped out of the vat using a large cloth, and placed in a beechwood hoop or mold. The hoops have a distinctly concave side that gives Beaufort its unusual shape. Cheeses are pressed for 20 hours under enormous pressure—up to one ton—and turned several times during the first 24 hours. After unmolding, the wheels are transferrd to a cool ""cave"" and stored for another 24 hours before being submerged in brine for a day. Thereafter, cheeses are turned and hand-salted on one side every morning and rubbed every afternoon while being stored on spruce shelves. This process continues for one to two months, and when the rind is deemed satisfactory, the routine changes to twice weekly turning, and an application of mixed salt and a substance called ""morge."" Morge is a mixture of brine, old cheese scrapings,and whey, and is known to contain at least 480 species of bacteria. This process develops the characteristic russet-colored rind of Beaufort. Wheels of Beaufort are matured for at least six months. During this time, flavors of the cheese concentrate and develop, becoming extremely deep and complex - especially with cheeses made from summer milk.The rind of Beaufort is a reddish-brown color and slightly sticky.Aromas are mildly pungent and pleasantly barnyardy. Flavors are savory, herbaceous, and fruity with notes of butter, grass, and salt underpinned by a granular sweetness.Pair it with wine: think Champagne, riesling, gamay, or tannat."

While inspired by Asiago, Bebé has been adapted to suit what cheesemaker Laurie Neal calls ""very special"" whole Jersey milk with a high butterfat content. That milk is sourced locally from on-site E`ire Dairy, a grass-fed, organic operation, and it`s neither standardized nor homogenized. According to Neal, this led to ""a bit of a learning curve... to craft a cheese that reflected the nuttiness of Asiago, but maintained [the milk`s] integrity."" Compared to traditional Asiago, the curd is cut larger and cooked at a lower temperature. After the cheese is made, Bebé is aged for at least three months but is always sold at less than a year old. Laurel`s Crown Cheese was launched in 2014. With the help of Neal`s husband Mark, an architect, as well as family and friends, a 48-foot refrigerated semi-trailer was converted into a creamery, fitting a large vat, kettle, walk-in cooler, and two aging rooms into a small space. Through Laurel`s Crown`s partnership with E`ire Dairy—they produce cheeses using only E`ire`s milk—milk is piped directly from pasteurization to Laurel`s Crown`s vat. In recent years, Laurel`s Crown has added two additional aging rooms in a second trailer.This flavorful cheese yields notes of pasture, hay, and toasted nuts.Bebé`s nutty flavor pairs well with pinot grigio or a dry riesling. While Bebé makes a satisfying table cheese, it also shines in cooked applications like mac and cheese or fondue."

Based on a Roquefort recipe, Beenleigh was created by Robin Congden, the founder of Ticklemore Cheese, who has been farming in the Sharpham area for the past 30 years. Beenleigh is one of only a handful of blue sheep`s milk cheeses produced in Britain. It is made between January and July, using milk sourced from a herd of Dorset-Friesland cross sheep owned by Terry Perkins, located near Launceston in Cornwall. Milk is heat treated prior to the addition of starter cultures and rennet. Once the milk has reached the correct acidity, the curd is cut, stirred and, after being allowed to rest, broken by hand and packed into molds. After draining, the surface of the cheese is salted and pierced with needles that allows the air to enter the cheese where it reacts with the natural enzymes and causes the development of blue veins. The interior paste of Beenleigh Blue is ivory-white in color, puctuated by delicate and widely spaced veins of blue-green mold. The texture is dense, smooth and moist. The rind of Beenleigh is sticky with patches of blue, grey and white mold. Flavors of Beenleigh are slightly sweet with hints of butterscotch and salt overlaid with spicy notes from the blue mold around the veins. A perfect companion for Beenleigh is cider or dessert wine."

Somewhat confusingly, this cheese can also be known as Aarauer Bierdeckel - ‘Bierdeckel’ is German for a traditional cardboard coaster you would get under your beer at a tavern or pub – or the name Kuentener. Milk is sourced locally from herds of Red Swiss cows. In the latter stages of production, cheeses are brined and lightly pressed before being matured in an aging cellar for four weeks. During this time, each wheel is washed regularly with unfermented wheat beer which results in the aromas of Beermat being distinctive and slightly musty. Flavors are slightly sour and reminiscent of Epoisses, but not unpleasant, with notes of walnuts - probably also a result of the wheat beer washings combined with the development of the brevibacterium linens mold. This cheese pairs well with darker ales, Alsatian white wines, sweeter sparkling white wines, or ports."

Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. BellaVitano Gold is an original cheese created by Sartori’s Master cheesemakers. Many of the company’s flavored cheeses—such as Espresso, Raspberry, and Merlot—start out as BellaVitano Gold before coatings are applied.At first taste reminiscent of parmesan, the cheese has light fruity notes and a surprisingly creamy, rich texture. Flavor finishes with a sweet and tangy hit. Notes of butter, amaretto and hazelnut are apparent, and crunchy crystalline bits further enliven the fudgy texture.Pair Reserve BellaVitano Gold with a Chianti, a light Italian red, or a Port. For beer pairings, try an IPA, a sweet cider, or a dark malty ale."

No; it’s one of the most unique cheeses we’ve ever seen.Belper Knolle literally translates to “the tuber from Belp,” a nod to its iconic earthy appearance. (“Belp” is the Swiss town in which the cheese is made.) First created in 1993, Belper Knolle is the invention of third-generation Herr Glauser, who runs a small dairy located in the small town near Berne.Raw milk is delivered directly to the dairy without being heated or cooled—instead, it’s made into cheese right away. Infused with garlic and rolled in ground black pepper, this cheese makes a statement on the eyes and the palate. Aged 13 to 15 weeks, this small cow’s milk sphere, distributed byJumi,becomes firm and flaky, rock hard in texture and impossible to slice, making it only suitable for shaving or grating.Despite the dry paste, aged Belper Knolle has an amazingly intense flavor. The mouthfeel and taste are initially almost cream-like and then the full force of the spices kicks in.

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.  Inspired by the traditional monastic style cheeses emanating from Europe, Benedictine is made from a blend of sheep, goat and cow’s milk. After the wheels are formed, cheeses are transferred to an aging cellar, where they are regularly washed and turned over a period of twelve weeks. The washing process encourages the development of various cultures present in the cheese, resulting in a complex flavor profile. The texture of Benedictine is pliant, firm and pale ivory in color.Good pairings include Pinot Gris, Cabernet and Belgian style ales."

Adams, who has a background as a baker, decided to make the switch to cheesemaking a few years back, starting with the adaptation of a camembert recipe for his first cheese. Organic milk for production is sourced exclusively from nearby Cedar Summit, a renowned dairy farm that has been owned and operated since 1926 by the Minar family. Now in their fourth generation, the family take huge pride in producting first rate quality milk from their mixed herd of Jersey, Normandy, Guernsey and Holstein cows. Adams is convinced that the quality of the milk greatly helps its transition into Bent River Camembert. After production, cheeses are matured for between five and six weeks prior to release. Encased in a bright white, flossy rind, Bent River Camembert has rich, clean and buttery flavors with hints of late summer grass and mushrooms. The texture is cream-like, soft and yielding."

Bergblumen Käse,,Switzerland,Fribourg,"14 ins diameter, 3 ins high",12lb,,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Produced in the mountains of Switzerland, Bergblumen Käse is made from raw cow`s milk with a traditional Alpine recipe ""Bergblume Käse "" literally translate from German to mean ""Mountain Flower Cheese."" In turn, what sets these cheeses apart is that after production, they are washed with a solution of mountain herbs and flowers harvested during the summer months. In addition to the washing, wheels are matured for six months on a bed of herbs and straw. The rind of Bergblumen Käse is dark brown in color and thin. The interior paste of the cheese is the color of pale caramel, punctuated with occasional holes or ""eyes"" and is dense and very smooth in texture. Given the maturation techniques, not surprisingly Bergblumen Käse is extremely aromatic and herbaceous - characteristics that are also apparent in the flavors of the cheese. Additionally there are sweet, balanced notes of butterscotch, grass, hay and barnyard."
Berkshire Blue,Berkshire Cheese,United States,Massachusetts,4-5,3 lbs,www.berkshirecheese.com,Cow,Raw,FirmBlue,Vegetable,Natural,Blue,,"Berkshire Blue has been produced since 2000 in Berkshire County, MA. Cheesemaker Ira Gramble took over the production of the British Stilton-inspired cheese from Michael Miller in 2009. Since then, he’s continued to produce the Western MA classic in a process modeled after that of Willett Dairy in Somerset, England. The raw Jersey cow’s milk used for Berkshire Blue is sourced from nearby Hav’s farm in Tyringham, MA. Besides the truck used to transport the milk and the pump and heating and refrigeration equipment, no other machinery is used in producing the cheese. To make it, three starter cultures are added to the raw milk (two types of blue mold and one type of white), along with vegetable rennet. The curds are hand-stirred, hand-cut and hand-ladled into three-pound molds, then turned and poked with needles to allow blue veining to form during aging. After being brined, wheels are sent to a draining room where they’re turned periodically over two days. Finally, they spend between 30 and 40 days in the maturation room, and then 15 days in a cold room until the aging period of 60 days is complete.Using Jersey milk, famous for its high fat content, yields a cheese that is similar to a Stilton but that is even more smooth and creamy. Flavor is subtle with hints of barnyard and hay.Pair it with a Port, a Reisling or a Sauterne. For beer pairings, try a stout."

Dig into its paste for a complex, evolving burst of flavor yielding notes of pineapple and caramel. It`s made at a lovely 16th century house and farm called Ram Hall, located in the West Midlands region of England.The Fletcher family has lived on the farm for six generations. They began milking sheep in 1989 and selling the milk, and at the suggestion of a local farm shop they soon began to experiment with cheesemaking. Cheese had apparently been produced at Ram Hall in the past, as the Fletchers discovered when they stripped off some old paint and found the words ""Cheese Room"" underneath. However the recipe had been lost and so they began to make Berkswell using a Caerphilly formula, which evolved from there. Berkswell is made in small vats under the guidance of cheesemaker Julie Hay. Milk is heated, starter cultures and rennet are added, and the milk is left to ripen. The curd is then cut and re-heated before being put into the colanders that give the cheeses their distinct flying saucer shape.Wheels are matured for at least six months before release.Berkswell has a natural rind that is slightly chewy and rusty brown-red in color. It also bears the distinctive imprint of the colanders in which it is formed.The texture is firm and dense and slightly granular with an interior paste the color of pale butter.Flavors are concentrated, sweet and very complex, with tremendous length and finish.

Bermuda Triangle,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,California,"8 inches long, 2 inch sides",1lb,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Bermuda Triangle was created in 1997 specifically with chefs in mind, since its triangular log format makes it ideal for slicing and provides interesting presentation on a cheese plate. For production of Bermuda Triangle, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are added and held for the acid ripening process. The mixture is then moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The remaining curd is mixed with salt, hand-packed into cheese forms, ashed, and then sprayed with mold cultures. The cheeses spend eight days during primary ripening where they are turned daily after which they are “cold stabilized” for several more days before being wrapped and sent to market.When young, the interior paste of the cheese is chalky-white in color and has a smooth, dense and slightly crumbly texture. With age, the paste starts to break down under the rind, becoming softer, slightly translucent and ultimately runny. Flavors of Bermuda Triangle are earthy and piquant. When young, the cheese is clean, bright and peppery due to the high rind-to-paste ratio. As it matures, flavors intensify and and can become quite assertive."
Berner Oberlaender Holbelkaese,Christian Hauerter,Switzerland,Bern,"15 ins diameter, 4 inches high",20 lbs,www.qualitycheese.net,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"One of only ten cheeses made in Switzerland with the AOC (name protected) designation, this version of Berner Oberlaender Hobelkaese is produced by cheesemaker Christian Hauerter at his dairy located 4900 ft above sea level, at Morgeten in the Swiss Canton of Bern. Christian Hauerter is a member of an Alp-Coop belonging to the community of Oberwil. The co-op consists of seven houses, one dairy and one restaurant all working together. The rules governing the production of Berner Oberlaender Hobelkaese are strict. Cheeses can only be made using raw cow’s milk from the Simmentaler breed during a period of about one hundred days during June, July and August, when the animals are grazing on the upper pastures of the Alps. These pastures contain certain varieties of herbs, flowers and grasses, all of which are essential to the character of the cheese. Hauerter`s herd grazes on the area known as “Leiternweide”, which literally translated means the ""ladder meadow"". Regarding the treatment of his cows, Christian Hauerter goes one step further than most producers. He’s convinced that cows that have not been de-horned (ie. are allowed to naturally grow their horns) are happier, more peaceful animals, who therefore produce better quality and more nutritious milk. Cheesemaking takes place in the small mountain huts adjacent to the pastures. This is also where the cheesemaker lives and sleeps while the cows are grazing on the upper slopes. This system ensures the cheesemaker uses the freshest milk possible and is also aware of the exact conditions under which the milk was produced – ie. what the animals have been eating, the weather conditions etc. Cheeses are made within eighteen hours of milking. The milk is heated and animal rennet added. At this point, the curd is heated again to 122?F in order to expel more whey, before the curds are transferred to molds and pressed. The finished wheels start their maturing process at the individual Alpine dairies while the families and the cheesemaker are still living on the upper slopes. At the end of the summer, when both humans and animals return to their lower farms, the cheeses are transferred to a cellar where they will continue maturing. During this time, cheeses are used both for the table as well as for cooking. After eighteen months of age, the cheese is used mostly for grating and cooking. This is also the point where cheeses are graded and some are are set aside for further aging into Hobelkaese. Maturation takes place at a temperature of 53-54?F and humidity of 70-75%. According to AOC rules, Hobelkaese (which means “grating cheese”) must be matured for between 2-3 years before release. The paste of Berner Oberlaender is hard and slightly waxy in texture and studded with white dots of crystalized amino acids that give the texture a pleasant crunch. The interior color is of pale straw in the center of the cheese becoming a darker golden towards the outside. Flavors are extremely rich, with notes of herbs, grasses, bacon and smoke. When shaved, the cheese forms itself into striking rolls or ""cigar"" shapes so is best used as a table cheese."

The village of Bethmale is located in the Couserans region of the Comté de Foix in south western France, and some of the best known examples of this cheese come from the cheesemakers at Jean Faup. Mention of Bethmale cheese dates back to the early 12th century, when Louis VI of France tasted it during a visit to the region. At the time, it was described as `the fat cheese of Saint-Girons`, a description that could still apply today since, when cut, the interior paste glows with fat and is distinctive for its horizontal slits. Milk for production of Bethmale comes from a large number of small local dairies. Milk is heated to 86°F, renneted and left to ripen for 45 minutes before being stirred for ten minutes. The whey is drained off and the curd cut by hand, then transferred into molds lined with thick cheesecloth. The first pressing of the cheese is done by hand and they are turned once, still within their molds. They are then pressed again by placing a heavy plank on top to expel more whey, which is left in place until the evening when the plank and cloths are removed. The next day, the wheels of Bethmale are salted on one side, followed by the other the day after. On the third day they are transferred to the maturing caves where they are aged for a minimum of four weeks, and usually eight. During this time they are regularly washed with a brine solution to encourage the growth of the Bacterium Linens mold that helps develop the cheese. The texture of Bethmale is semisoft, supple and yielding, and cheeses are covered with a dense beige rind. The interior paste varies from ivory-white through to buttery-yellow depending on the season, and is dotted with small holes and slits. Aromas are pleasantly pungent, smelling of damp cellar and earth. Flavors are mild, very rich, milky and buttery with notes of grass, wood and mushrooms."

The late 1990’s saw the easing of extremely strict Swiss cheesemaking regulations. This meant that although some producers remain dedicated to making very traditional Swiss cheeses, many new and innovative cheesemakers also entered the market. Beeler, who has been affectionately dubbed by his peers as “Switzerland’s Pope of Cheese” owns a cheese shop in Lucerne dedicated to selling fine Swiss cheeses made by small-scale cheesemakers. His home town is located close to Kuenten and about 15 years ago, Beeler and Bruelisauer started working together - a partnership that has produced some very innovative cheeses that also maintain the spirit of Swiss cheesemaking tradition. In the late 1990’s, Beeler also formed a partnership with Caroline Hostettler, who was among the first to import quality artisanal Swiss cheese into the USA, thereby bringing Beeler’s cheeses to a wider audience. Rolf and Sepp’s inspiration for this Bierdeckel was to create something that texturally resembles a perfectly ripe Taleggio combined with the flavor and aroma of an Epoisses. Milk for production of Bierdeckel is sourced locally from herds of Red Swiss cows. Young cheeses are brined and lightly pressed before being matured in an aging cellar for four weeks. Bierdeckel, which literally translates as “beermat”, is washed in unfermented wheat beer during the maturing process. Bierdeckel has a very aromatic dark orange rind dotted with with dark brown flecks and an interior that is ivory to light yellow. The rind has a slightly granular texture that contrasts nicely with a pliant paste, often dotted with small “eyes” or holes.Bierdeckel’s flavor is a subtle reflection of its aroma which is tangy with a bit of salt. It has a perfume-like quality that lingers on the nose.The cheese is best paired with, not surprisingly, wheat beers. Bierdeckel is also a great cheese to pair with dry sparkling wines, or a fruit forward red wine such as Malbec. Recommended accompaniments include grainy mustard and cornichon, or a dark honey, such as one made from Buckwheat."

Amy and Stephen Hueffed first started dreaming of a lifestyle change during an inspiring trip through Northern California, where they sampled local cheeses and pondered one day producing their own. A few years later in 2005, after taking Washington State University cheesemaking classes in Pullman and Skagit Valley, Amy and Stephen finally settled onto their farm with a flock of 60 dairy ewes. Since then Willapa Hills, now home to three generations of the Hueffed family, has continuously revised and expanded its activities and product line. The diverse mix of sheep’s milk, cow’s milk and mixed-milk cheeses is produced with a long-term commitment to sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. For example, the farm has switched over to growing all of its own hay, lowering costs of overall feed and ensuring that hay is natural and free of pesticides and commercial fertilizers. Stephen and Amy began producing this cheese in an effort to create the perfect blue. “You may already know that artisan cheesemakers are an idealistic bunch,” admits Stephen. Wheels are aged for at least two months before being packaged and adorned with a label featuring the pair’s two sons in kayaks. Along with their sister, who is featured on the Pluvius cheese label, the boys have served as an inspiration to their cheesemaking parents.This cheese has fresh, salty and vegetal aromas and lacks the astringency often found in other blue cheeses. Paste is humid, creamy and smooth in texture, while flavor is briny, packing a salty, mouth-puckering bite. Blue flavor is enjoyable, pungent without being offensive.Pair this cheese with something sweet to counteract the saltiness, such as a Moscato jam."

Having owned a traditional dairy farm on the site for many years, the brothers wanted to adapt their method of farming to allow for their cows to range freely on pasture. It was also their vision to use milk from their own herd to develop a cheesemaking facility on site. This they have achieved, and Saxon Homestead Creamery makes a range of cow`s milk cheeses such as Greenfields, Big Ed`s, Pastures, Saxony and Meadows. To add to their repertoire, Saxon is also collaborating with nearby LaClare Farm. Owned by Larry Hedrich, LaClare is a small-scale goat dairy with extremely high milk quality standards. The does have room to exercise and graze on pasture, and are fed whole grains and other foods that goats love.

Big John's Cajun,Beehive Cheese Company,United States,Utah,"12-14 ins diameter, 3 ins high",18 lbs,www.beehivecheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,,,"Founded in 2005 by brothers-in-law Tim Welsh and Pat Ford, Beehive Cheese Company is located at the mouth of the Weber Canyon near Uintah in UT - about half an hour north of Salt Lake City. They are one of the few artisanal cheesemakers in Utah. Having previously worked in the worlds of software and real estate, both men harbored a belief in revitalizing the concept of the local creamery. With the help of The Western Dairy Center at Utah State University, they began to turn their vision into reality. Pat and Tim built the family owned and operated creamery from the ground up. Jersey cow’s milk, known for its high butterfat content, is sourced from Wadeland South Dairy, located about 10 miles from the creamery. The milk arrives from Wadeland at about midnight when it’s just a few hours old. Cheesemaking begins almost immemdiately, starting with pasteurization and the addition of starter cultures. After being left to ‘ripen’, microbial rennet is added to coagulate the milk, which is then hand cut. The excess whey is drained off and the remaining curds are “cheddared” to achieve the right moisture and pH level before being put through a mill and finally transferred into molds for pressing. Named after local chef John Dearmin, Big John’s Cajun was developed after the chef showed up one day with a bag of Cajun meat “rub” and suggesting it could be used for the cheese. Unlike a typical Cajun rub, John’s version uses cayenne pepper instead of paprika. At one day old, wheels have a light application of canola oil wiped on them, just to the point where the surface becomes tacky. Then the rub is smeared on with one motion since, according to Pat Ford, “if its worked too much it becomes a mess - rather like pottery”.Big John’s Cajun is ideal for cooking as the spiciness of the rub balances well with the rich, smooth and melty texture of the cheese. Near the rind, flavors intensify and pack a considerable punch.This cheese works really well as an ingredient in mac & cheese, chicken focaccia with avocado, shaved on a salad or melted over a burger. Beverage pairings include Champagne, sweet non-fortified white wines, lagers and ales."

Other cheeses have also followed: Queso Fresco de Oveja, and Big Woods Blue, together with Hidden Falls, Harmand, and a traditional Ricotta that are available on a limited basis. The sheep at Shepherd`s Way are almost entirely Friesian crosses and are rotationally grazed on home pasture. Against this backdrop, in January of 2005 the Read family suffered a devastating tragedy when a large-scale fire destroyed two barns containing two thirds of their 550 milking ewe flock, and their entire crop of 200 new lambs. Rather than giving up, the Reads decided to try and rebuild their lives and their business, which they are now doing with the help of friends and supporters. They are utterly committed to the project and are now in a position where they are able to produce their cheeses once more. In 2007, Jodi was able to re-commence cheesemaking and they are starting to sell more cheese as it becomes available. The interior paste of Big Woods Blue is an ivory color, shot through with pale blue-green veins that are more concentrated towards the center of the cheese. Flavors are assertively spicy, peppery and tangy but are held in check by naturally sweet notes of the sheep`s milk."

There, the cheeses develop their Geotrichum candidum rind that develops their distinctive character.Flavors are clean, milky, and sweet with rich, balanced notes of grass and hay.The rind of Bijou is delicate, thin, slightly wrinkly, and a pale cream color, whilethe texture of the pasteis moist, dense, and crumbly in the center, becoming soft and smooth just under the rind as the cheeses mature."
Billy Blue,Carr Valley Cheese Co,United States,Wisconsin,"4 inches high,  7 inches diameter",6 lbs,www.carrvalleycheese.com,Goat,,FirmBlue,Vegetable,None,Blue,,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties, as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 100 different cheeses. Made from local goat`s milk, Billy Blue is a blue cheese aged for a minimum of four months before release. The ivory-colored paste is shot through with pockets and veins of blue that produce a slightly crumbly texture.Flavors are fresh, tangy and assertive yet balanced by the savory notes of the goat`s milk."
Black and Bleu,Winter Park Dairy,United States,Florida,"4” tall, 8” diameter",4-5 lbs,www.winterparkdairy.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"Owned and operated by the Green family for 4 generations, Winter Park Dairy was originally a citrus farm located on Lake Florence in central Florida. However, the frosts of the mid-1980’s destroyed many of the family’s citrus trees. The current generation of Greens, David and his wife Dawn, founded Winter Park Dairy in 2001 as a measure to keep the farm going. In the beginning, Winter Park had its own closed herd of Jersey cows. Now though, the milk for the dairy comes from local family dairies. In 2008, Winter Park was the first dairy to be licensed as a raw milk cheese-making facility by the USDA/State of Florida. The cheeses produced at Winter Park are all hand made. The process begins with a water-heated vat imported from Holland that gradually brings the milk up to 90° F. Microbial rennet that the dairy imports from France is then added to the milk and stirred in by hand. The curd is formed, cut, hooped and then aged for a minimum of 60 days as required by U.S. federal law for all raw milk cheeses. The unique recipe for Black and Bleu was given to the Green family by a South Asian cheesemaker friend, Rose. The black in Black & Bleu is from black peppercorns that are cracked and roasted before being added to the cheese curds.When combined with the blue mold in the cheese, it makes for a powerful flavor that is rich and tangy with the spice of the peppercorns. It has a light grey natural rind with pale yellow paste streaked with blue veins and large eyes sparsely dotted throughout. The blue mold covers the interior of each eye, making them look like the inside of geode. There are small specks of black peppercorn sprinkled throughout the paste as well.This cheese works particularly well melted onto steaks. It pairs well with bold red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Super Tuscans or Spanish wines such as Temperanillo."
Black & Blue,FireFly Farms,United States,Maryland,"6-7 ins diameter, 3 ins high",5 lbs,www.fireflyfarms.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Waxed,Blue,,"Founded in 2002, FireFly Farms is owned by Mike Koch and Pablo Solanet and produces a range of cheeses made from goat’s milk. The partners’ original creamery was located in a neighbor’s converted barn, adjacent to the herd of milking does. After a few years, the company soon started to outgrow the premises and Koch and Solanet began searching for a new location in 2008. One year later premises were acquired in Accident, Maryland, in a historic building that was formerly a machine shop. Over the course of three years the building was converted, and is now home to the creamery as well as FireFly Farms’ flagship retail store. The store allows plenty of interaction between customers and the cheese business as well as being an attraction to visitors in Garrett County. The original herd of milking does was sold in 2006. FireFly Farms now sources goat milk from six local farms, each located within 20 miles of the creamery. Cheesemaking operations are managed by Matt Cedro together with Head Cheesemaker Dan Porter. FireFly makes a variety of both younger and more aged cheeses that have won numerous awards at national competitions. Their cheeses are produced from pasteurized milk since Maryland regulations require this. FireFly Farms` Black & Blue was developed in early spring 2007. The intent was to develop a longer-aged blue cheese with complex flavors. The outer casing of black wax allows moisture to be retained during aging as well as to provide a contrast to the white and blue interior. Early versions of the cheese were introduced at farmer’s markets, and after an enthusiastic reception, FireFly went into full production with the Black & Blue. During their maturation, cheeses are pierced to allow the blue veining to develop. At about five weeks of age, wheels are waxed and matured for a further three months before release. The intent is to be able to mature cheeses for up to nine months of age, when the flavors become even more complex. However, consumer demand together with limited aging space currently dictates the four month release date. Black and Blue is made during eight months of the year.The interior of Black & Blue is semi-soft with an ivory-colored paste marbled with dark blue-green veins. Flavors are buttery, rich and complex with distinct but balanced notes of blue and salt.Good beverage pairings include meaty red wines such as Petite Bordeaux, Malbec and port or, at the other end of the scale, riesling."
Black Goat,Prairie Fruits Farm,United States,Illinois,"¾” tall, 3” diameter",5 oz,www.prairiefruits.com,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Ash coated,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Prairie Fruits Farm was founded in 2003 by the husband and wife team of Wes Jarrell and Leslie Cooperband, who left academic and urban lives in Madison, WI to run a farm in Champaign Urbana, IL. With a focus on organic and sustainable farming, Wes and Leslie set about restoring the 7-acre farm’s soils that had been previously used for cash grain crops. A task that in 2004 led them to plant 350 fruit trees, 600 berry plants, and the purchase of their first Nubian goats. In 2005, they were licensed as a Grade A goat dairy and farmstead creamery. Since then, Wes and Leslie have grown the farm to more than 40 acres and expanded their goat herd to around 70 milking does of both the Nubian and La Mancha breeds. While the couple uses milk from their own herd, they also purchase sheep’s milk from the only licensed sheep dairy in the state. With the goat and sheep’s milk cheeses that Prairie Fruits Farm produces, they are dedicated to highlighting the terroir of Central Illinois. Named after a particularly precocious and endearing baby goat born on Prairie Fruits Farm, Black Goat is a small puck of hand-ladled goat cheese. The day after the curd is ladled into its mold and it has drained, each newly formed cheese is coated with a mixture of salt and vegetable ash. Cheese are aged for 3 weeks before release and during this time, each round develops a rind comprised of geotrichum mold.The result is a cheese with a chalky and dense, but still mousse-like texture. It has a bright lemon-like tang with a touch of sour cream behind. On the finish, Black Goat has a fresh grassy character with gentle yeasty notes.Black Goat is best paired with a dry white wine such as a Sauvignon Blanc. For those who prefer beer, Belgian Style Ales are the best, and Dry Hard Cider is still another alternative that is lovely with this cheese."

There on the property near Portland Maine,which has been in the Knight family since the 1700s, lies Silvery Moon Creamery.Holstein cows graze here outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt, who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” To produce this cheese, the milk is first gently batch pasteurized – at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer – in an effort to preserve the integrity of Smiling Hill Farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. Milk is then cultured and renneted, and the curd is cut with a vertical harp before it’s hand-ladled into molds. After draining and salting, squares are rubbed with a layer of vegetable ash and aged in the farm’s cheese cave for six weeks, flipped periodically to ensure the even distribution of moisture and the white fuzzy rind.Black Knight’s grassy scent is reminiscent of camembert. Underneath its ashed rind, a gooey interior creamline surrounds a firm, curdy center. Flavor is intense, earthy and grassy, with a subtle tang that gradually builds amidst background notes of honey.On a cheeseplate, serve Black Knight alongside apples, pears or honey. For wine pairings, try it with a Gruener Veltliner or a reisling."
Black Pepper BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavor Added,Cheddar-like,Flavor added to rind,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. Primarily renowned for the production of hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility, many of whom have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off.The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that, the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey. Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing.This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings.For production of Black Pepper BellaVitano, wheels of BellaVitano Gold are hand-coated with premium coarse-ground black pepper. The spicy bite of the black pepper balances and contrasts with the rich, rounded fruity notes of the interior paste. Due to the cheese’s extended maturation, the paste also has a slightly crystalline texture which also adds a layer of complexity and sweetness to the flavor.Black Pepper BellaVitano pairs well with roast beef and burgers, crusty artisan breads and dried nuts. Good wine pairings include Chianti and lighter reds, and Chardonnay. Beers include India Pale Ales, American Pale Ales and Belgian Trappist Ales."

With careers as professors within the Wisconsin and Illinois university systems, (Wes as head of Agricultural Science, and Leslie with a strong background in soil science and management) both bring a great deal of experience to farming life. Wes generally takes care of the goats and does the milking, while Leslie oversees the cheesemaking. The herd of Nubian and La Mancha milking goats currently numbers about 60 within a closed herd system. The milk is of extremely good quality and yields exceptionally high solids. The most recent development is that Prairie Fruits Farm is buying a limited quantity of sheep`s milk from a local Amish dairy farmer. To that end, Leslie has started experimenting with several sheep`s milk cheeses that compliment the existing range of goat`s milk cheese. Leslie produces several different varieties of cheese, ranging from a fresh chèvre through to a raw milk blue. Most of her sales take place at Farmers` Markets or go to select retail stores, where invariably demand exceeds supply.Black Sheep is dusted in vegetable ash which balances and neutralizes the acidity in the cheese resulting in a mellow and buttery flavored cheese with a pleasantly clean finish. In various stages of ripeness the cheese also takes chalky, lemony, and tangy notes."
Blackstone,Bellwether Farms,United States,California,,3.25 lbs,www.bellwetherfarms.com,SheepCow,Pasteurised,Hard,Animal,Flavor Added,,Flavor added to rind," Named after the volcanic outcroppings that surround Sonoma, Ca.-based Bellwether farms, a wheel of this cheese literally looks like it erupted out of a volcano— until it’s cut open to reveal a lovely yellow paste speckled with peppercorn polka-dots. Aptly-named Blackstone was released in 2016 by the Callahan family, who own and operate Bellwether farms in the rolling hills of Sonoma County, just a few miles from the Pacific Ocean. Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, Cindy Callahan decided to change direction in the early 1990s and start a sheep farm. Today her herd consists mainly of East Friesian ewes, found grazing freely outside year-round. Cindy’s son Liam Callahan oversees cheese production, while his wife Diana manages the office. To supplement the range of sheep’s milk cheeses, the Callahans also buy local Jersey cow’s milk in order to make this mixed-milk cow and sheep wheel.The rind’s mix of crushed black pepper, oil, rosemary and vegetable ash is seriously earthy, while the mix of rich Jersey cow’s milk and sheep’s milk gives it a creaminess that almost reminds us of cake batter, while yielding background aromas of fruity mango. The verdict: complex, visually striking and delicious.Try this alongside a lighter red wine or darker beers—a pinot noir, Burgundy, or a stout. It’s also great with a 65-70% cacao dark chocolate."

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early `80s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as some aged cheeses—including these wheels of Blanca Bianca. Blanca Bianca is Mozzarella Company’s only raw milk cheese. Aged for at least two months, the wheels are repeatedly washed with white wine, developing a faint pink rind.Wheels of Blanca Bianca are sticky and pungent, with a surface that smells of wet wood and limburger cheese. Rind is meaty and paste is dense and fudgy, with a mouth-coating texture that yields long lasting funky, tannic and cave-y flavors. Hints of wet fur, bitter pith and grapefruit can be detected.Pair Blanca Bianca with a Sauvignon Blanc."

This is the heart of the Emmentaler producing region. However, although Christoph and his father Christian still produce Emmentaler, in recent years the market has become dominated by larger producers with the result that there is a surfeit of cheese. In order to keep their business alive, Christophe decided to diversify and now produces a variety of other cheeses of which Blaues Wunder is one. Milk for production is sourced locally from Simmental and red Holstein cows. For production of Blaues Wunder, cream is added to the milk which is then thermalised before the starter cultures are added. The milk is allowed to ""ripen"" (ie the cultures start to become active) for about 30 minutes before the rennet is added together with the addition of penicillium roqueforti, that jump starts the development of the blue mold. The milk is allowed to coagulate for 30 minutes before being cut and stirred and then ladled by hand into plastic molds. The newly formed cheeses are turned regularly for the first 24 hours before being dry salted and then, 72 hours after production, pieced to allow air into the cheese, causing the development of the blue veins. After four weeks maturation, the cheeses are ready to be released. The exterior rind of Blaues Wunder is powdery blue in color and slightly yielding. This encases a bone white/gray interior, shot through with delicate blue veins. The texture is semi-soft. Flavors taste of cream with a hint of spice imparted by the blue, and an underlying sweetness."

After settling for a time in Belgium, a small group travelled to Quebec just before the outbreak of World War I. Upon arrival, they purchased land located about 100 miles southeast of Montreal on Lake Memphremagog. With a motto of “pray and work,” the monks established apple orchards for the production of apple sauce and cider, and in 1943, constructed a cheese-making facility. Today, the Abbey now produces several styles of cheese including blues, gruyère style cheeses, and Ricotta. Created in 2000, Blue Benedictine is an award winning cow’s milk blue with a grey and white mottled natural rind.Aged for three months, Blue Benedictine’s texture is smooth and buttery. Its aroma is of mushrooms and the paste is off-white in color with blue-green veins running throughout. The monks use Penicillium Roqueforti (the same blue used in Roquefort) in this cheese, which makes for a nice contrast in flavor to the rich paste that has a touch of earthiness and salt.Pair this blue with a nice fruit forward red such as a Pinot Noir or Grenache."

Bleu d`Auvergne was granted AOC (name protected) in 1975 and is available in both cooperative and industriel versions. The origins of Bleu d`Auvergne are relatively recent, only appearing on the market in the middle of the 19th century. Its exact history is unconfirmed, although legend has it that the recipe orignated from an Auvergne farmer who experiemented by sprinkling mold (Penicilium Roqueforti) growing on a piece of his rye bread into newly formed curd. The resulting cheese proved popular and, after the recipe was perfected by Antoine Rousset, the cheese became known as Bleu d`Auvergne. Milk for production would have orignally come from the breed of Ferrandaire cow. Today, production of Bleu d`Auvergne purposely involves the curd being inoculated with Penicillium Roqueforti. After the curd is placed in the molds, cheeses are allowed to drain naturally under their own weight for several days. They are unpressed. After being unmolded and dry salted, wheels are pieced with needles to allow air to penetrate and accelerate the development of blue veining. The texture of Bleu d`Auvergne is consistent, moist and slightly sticky, shot through with blue-green veins against an ivory-colored paste. Cheeses have a natural rind that is a light brown-orange color and slightly sticky. Flavors are buttery yet tangy, with notes of spice, pepper and salt.

Granted AOC (name protected) status in 1986, the areas of production are the ""Departments"" of l`Ain and Jura, and milk for production must be sourced from Montbeliard or Pie Rouge de l`Est cows that graze in a designated area within the Jura mountains. The history of Bleu de Gex is closely related to that of Bleu de Sassenage, and the cheeses have a number of similarities, as they both originated in the the village of Villard-de-Lans. When, in 1348, the Dauphiné region was ceded to the first French Dauphin, a number of the cheesemakers emigrated to the ""Pays de Gex"" (a region that had been previously been dominated by sheep and goat cheese) taking the recipe with them. With the encouragement of the Bishop at the abbey at Saint-Claude, the cheesemakers established production of Bleu de Gex and Bleu de Septmoncel which have both become recognized in their own right. Production of Blue de Gex still takes place in the small mountain dairies, employing the same traditional methods established in the 14th century. Aromas of Bleu de Gex are mild but distinctly nutty and smell of damp earth and cellar. The texture of the cheese is dense, close and supple, shot through with fine blue-green veins. The color of the interior paste varies from butter-yellow to ivory depending on the season and cheeses have a thin, brown rind that is embossed with the word ""Gex"". Flavors are mild, buttery, and rounded with a slightly spicy and peppery note imparted by the blue veins. Blue de Gex pairs well with a fruity regional red wine such as a Beaujolais or Burgundy."
Bleu de Sassenage,Various laiteries,France,Rhone Alps,"12 ins diameter, 4 ins high",10-11 lbs,,Cow,,BlueSemi Soft,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Produced just west of Grenoble in southeastern France, the origins of Bleu de Sassenage are recorded as far back as 1338. Its importance was recognized in a charter created by Baron Albert de Sassenage which established the right of the inhabitants of Villard-de-Lans to sell their cheeses unhindered. The village also had its own breed of cattle, the Villard, that produces high protein milk for cheese production and this practice continues today. (It`s interesting to note that a few years after the charter, some cheesemakers decided to move to the Gex area where they established Bleu de Gex, a very similar cheese to Bleu de Sassenage.) Over the years production of Bleu de Sassenage has declined sharply, especially during the 20th century with the advent of refrigerated transport. Many dairy farmers and cheesemakers abandoned cheesemaking, instead choosing to sell their fresh milk on the open market. Recently, the resurrection of Bleu de Sassenage was undertaken by a local dairy near Grenoble. They relaunched the cheese and their production now accounts for the overall majority of wheels made. Remaining wheels come from nine producers in the ""Departments"" of the Drome and the Isere, in the foothills of the Alps. Made from raw cow`s milk, Bleu de Sassenage was granted AOC designation (name protection) in 1998. The AOC rules stipulate that cheeses must be produced within the region contained by the Vercours National Park, near Grenoble. The texture of Bleu de Sassenage is dense and close and supple, shot through with fine blue-green veins. The color of the interior paste varies from butter-yellow to ivory depending on the season, and cheeses have a thin, brown rind. Aromas are of brown butter and damp cellar.

Bleu des Causses,Various,France,"Languedoc, Midi Pyrenees","8 ins diameter, 4 ins high",6 lbs,,Cow,,BlueSemi Soft,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Produced in the Languedoc region of southern France, Bleu des Causses is made from raw milk from the Montbeliarde and Aubrac breeds of of cow. Bleu des Causses was granted AOC (name protected) status in 1979. Traditionally the recipe for Bleu des Causses would have probably involved the use of sheep`s milk mixed with either cow`s or goat`s milk. However, as a result of legislation surrounding the production of other French blue cheeses, in 1947 it was decreed that it should be made solely from cow`s milk. The recipe for Bleu des Causses bears many similarities to Blue d`Auvergne, although Bleu des Causses usually has a slightly softer texture, a creamier mouthfeel, and more peppery, spicy flavors. During production, milk is renneted at 86°F, coagulated, cut into large cubes and stirred several times prior to draining and the addition of Penicilium Roqueforti (blue mold). The drained curd is placed into molds that are then transferred to a draining room. They remain there, still draining, for three or four days at a temperature of 64°F, and are turned several times before being unmolded and dry salted. The young salted wheels rest for three days and are then moved to natural caves, known as ""caves batards"" (illegitimate caves) located in the limestone plateaux of the the Gorges du Tarn, where the cheeses are matured. The caves are exposed to the north and are ventilated by natural chimneys, known as ""fleurines,"" formed in the cliffs, which allow clean air carrying natural microflora to flow through the caves. The microflora play an essential role in the maturation and flavor development of Bleu des Causses and also introduce the ""terroir""of the region. Wheels of Bleu des Causses are typically aged between three and six months before release. Cheeses made during the winter months are paler in color than their summer counterparts, a result of the variation in the cow`s diet. The texture of cheeses made during the winter tends to be slightly drier. Flavors of Bleu des Causses are assertive but not harsh. There are hints of grass and clover, especially in summer cheeses. The richness of the milk balances out the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mold, resulting in a complex, rounded and long lasting finish."

The Batjes keep a large herd of Saanen dairy goats, and along with six employees produce cheeses from March to November, selling them mostly in the metropolitan St. Louis area.  Steve and Veronica wake up at 3 am each day to milk their 53 goats, and spend the rest of the day turning that milk into cheese. Goats receive an unlimited supply of filtered spring water to drink from the farm’s spring, and their diet—an all-natural antibiotic-free whole grain ration—is supplemented with organic herbal teas, organic mineral supplements, locally grown alfalfa hay, and the farm’s pasture. The milking season begins in spring and ends in winter, giving the goats a break for several months a year. Named after the Missouri town in which the Baetjes’ farm is located, and inspired by the hills surrounding the property, Bloomsdale is a mold-ripened goat cheese modeled after the French classicValençay. It’s formed into a shape of a pyramid with a flattened top (according to legend, it was Napoleon who chopped off the top of the cheese pyramid, as it reminded him of his disastrous campaign in Egypt). Bloomsdale, which is rolled in a mixture of ash and salt, turns progressively softer as it ages, until it becomes runny. Minimum aging time is 10 days.With age, the cheese begins to develop flavor compounds slightly reminiscent of blue cheese.Pair it with a Sauvignon Blanc, a Chardonnay, or a Touraine wine. According to the Baetjes, many of their customers like to use the cheese as a savory sauce for grilled steak."

The history of the company dates back to the early 1900s, when Ernesto Carpenedo began working as a “casoin” (a word in local dialect for a cheesemonger) in a shop in the village of Preganziol. Ernesto eventually founded his own company, which is today run by his son Antonio and his grandsons Ernesto and Alessandro, who have over thirty years of experience in the dairy-cheese sector. Antonio has been devoting his attention to affinage since 1976, the year that he began steeping his first rounds of cheese in wine, giving birth to La Casearia’s signature Ubriaco.  In 1961 Antonio married Giuseppina, and the wine-and-cranberry ripened Blu ’61 was created 50 years later as an ode to their love—both for one another and for great cheeses. The cow’s milk blue is aged over three months using local sweet wine Passito di Raboso and wine-soaked cranberries. With a paste that grows soft and creamy with age, and a thin red rind paved with the berries on top, Blu ’61 has a striking and memorable appearance.Aromatic and intense notes typical of blue cheese are balanced by sweet and fruity tones with scents of cherry.

Blu del Moncenisio,Val de Susa dairies,Italy,French / Italian Savoie,"8 ins diameter, 6 ins high",5-7 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Semi SoftBlue,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Blu del Moncenisio is produced in relatively small numbers by the artisanal Val de Susa dairies, located in the Moncenisio Pass which spans the French Italian Savoie. Milk for production is sourced from local herds of cows. During the winter months they remain on the lower mountain pastures but are moved to the higher meadows during the summer months, where they take advantage of the array of summer grasses, herbs and flowers. Blu del Moncenisio is is an unpressed cheese which accounts for its high moisture content and creamy mouthfeel. Post production, wheels are dry salted before being transferred to maturing rooms where they are aged for a minimum of 90 days. In appearance, wheels of Blu del Moncenisio are drum shaped with a natural, slightly orange, sticky rind. Internally, cheeses are shot through with pockets of blue (as opposed to veins) that are surrounded by an ivory-cream colored paste. Flavors range from fairly mild to assertive depending on age and season. There are notes of wood, straw and nuts, underpinned by marked vegetal flavors with a balanced constant blue presence. Excellent pairings for Blu del Moncenisio include a crispy Sauvignon or sweeter dessert wines."
Blu di Bufala,Azienda Agricola Gritti Bruno e Alfio,Italy,Lombardy,8 in width x 5 in height,9 lb,www.quattroportoni.it,Buffalo,,Blue,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Blu di Bufala is a blue buffalo milk cheese made by brothers Bruno and Alfio Gritti at Caseificio Quattro Portoni, near Bergamo in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. In a landscape dominated by traditional cheesemaking operations, Quattro Portoni is unique. Water buffalo cheesemaking is a practice more associated with southern Italy than the north, and the Gritti brothers have made a name for themselves by creating inspired originals. The dairy farm was founded by Bruno and Alfio’s father, Renato Gritti, in 1968. After the brothers took it over in 1982, they faced an increasing struggle to make a viable living, largely due to steadily falling fluid milk prices. Although converting to cheesemaking would have added value of the milk, it would also have put them in direct competition with some of the region’s most dominant dairies. For that reason, they made the bold decision in 2000 to purchase their first 40 water buffalo from a local Lombardy farmer and, along with some help from an instructor at a local dairy school, began to develop various cheese recipes using the buffalo milk. Today, with the number of water buffalo nearing 1000 head, Quattro Portoni are producing a number of different cheeses all made from buffalo milk, including Quadrello di Bufala, Granbu, and Casatica. Blu di Bufala is a decadent whole milk blue cheese aged at least three months. The rind is a dry and wrinkled gray color, while the paste is straw-colored and intersected with silvery ribbons of mold. Its texture is crumbly, yet creamy on the palate.Blu di Bufala has a distinctive, well-balanced flavor with a hint of sweetness and an intense, tangy bite.Pair it with a Prosecco, a Moscato d`Asti or some dark chocolate."

Hansen, who was born in Denmark, is staying true to a family legacy; both his grandfather and great-grandfather worked in the Danish dairy industry. After building a career as a software engineer in the US, Hansen and his wife Louisa decided to pursue a homesteading lifestyle. They moved to Travelers Rest from Austin, Tx., and began refurbishing a local warehouse to build a cheesemaking facility.   Hansen makes cheese out of raw cow’s milk sourced from Southern Oaks Jersey Farm in nearby Abbeville County. As his cheeses are found in more and more local shops and restaurants, he plans to add a 400-gallon vat to store milk and to open a cheese shop in front of his creamery.   Blue Ridge Bleu was inspired by British traditional Stilton. Hansen’s very first aged cheese, the striking blue-veined wheel develops a natural rind while aging. Blue Ridge Bleu has aromas of apples, grapes, and rose. Its semi-soft, blue-veined paste has a flavor that builds, starting light, fruity and milky and finishing with hints of earth and bark.

Blue Sunshine,Winter Park Dairy,United States,Florida,"3” tall, 6 ” diameter",4-5 lbs,www.winterparkdairy.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Natural,Blue,,"Owned and operated by the Green family for 4 generations, Winter Park Dairy was originally a citrus farm located on Lake Florence in central Florida. However, the frosts of the mid-1980’s destroyed many of the family’s citrus trees. The current generation of Greens, David and his wife, Dawn founded Winter Park Dairy in 2001 in an effort to keep the farm going. In the beginning, Winter Park had its own closed herd of Jersey cows. Now though, the milk for the dairy comes from local family dairies. In 2008, Winter Park became the first dairy to be licensed as a raw milk cheese-making facility by the USDA/State of Florida. The cheeses produced at Winter Park are all hand made. The process begins with a water-heated vat imported from Holland that gradually brings the milk up to 90° F, but no higher. Microbial rennet that the dairy imports from France is then added to the milk, and the mixture is hand-agitated. The curd is cut, hooped aged. All the cheeses are raw milk and are therefore aged for 60 days as required by US federal law. Bleu Sunshine was the first cheese produced by Winter Park Dairy. Created while David was taking cheesemaking classes at the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese at the University of Vermont, it was named by Dr. Monserrat Almena-Aliste.The cheese is aged for over 60 days, which provides the blue veining plenty of time to spread throughout the paste. It has a thin light brown rind with grey molds on the top. Underneath is a light yellow paste with a rich texture. It has a strong, assertive taste with prominent notes of blue.This cheese is best when paired with traditional wines for blue cheeses including Port and Sauternes. Bleu Sunshine is a versatile cheese when it comes to food, it can be served with fresh fruit such as pears or it can be paired with chocolate. It works very well melted over steaks."

Some say the style itself was invented at Westfield Farm in Massachusetts, originally owned by Bob and Lettie Kilmoyer. The self-taught cheesemaking couple had a penchant for experimentation, and decided to use Penicillium roqueforti—the mold that gives classic blues its inside veins—to colonize only the rind of the cheese. While initially confronted with skepticism, the style caught on, and was eventually granted its own American Cheese Society Judging & Competition category. Soon after, Westfield`s externally-rinded blues began winning scads of awards. Since 1996, Bob and Debby Stetson have run Westfield Farm, continuing production of its originals and expanding the cow`s and goat`s milk cheese repertoire. Bluebonnet is an adapted version of Westfield Farm`s famous classic Blue Log, a surface-ripened blue goat`s milk cheese.To make it, freshly-formed chèvre curds are inoculated with the Penicillium roquefortimold. They`re then formed into log shapes that either remain as such for production of Blue Log, or are sliced into three sections for production of the Bluebonnet, forming a small crottin-shaped cheese. After production, cheeses are transferred to a maturing room where they age for about one or two weeks, losing some moisture and developing an exterior covering of blue mold. Unlike traditional blues, which are pierced so that oxygen flows into the cheese and promotes blue mold growth, these buttons are soft and compact, discouraging the growth of mold in the paste.With age, the soft, bone-white, featherlight core of this button is gradually overtaken by an expanding creamline. Flavors are milky, clean, and bright with notes of citrus and stone, melding into a bitter finish with a piquant blue tang."

The Jensens live in the heart of Amish country and herd a flock of over 500 of Lacaune and East Friesian ewes. Their mission is to besustainable; they employ Amish friends and neighbors for both milking and construction, while a team of Percheron draft horses (not tractors) plow their fields, and a donkey keep coyotes and other predators away from their lambs. Brenda makes several cheeses at Hidden Springs Farm, but when she decided to craft a blue wheel, she turned to a longtime Wisconsin blue cheesemaker.The blue mold culture that goes into the production of many blue cheeses, Penicilium roqueforti,has a tendency to dominate and change other varieties of cheese being produced in the same facility, so many cheesemakers are cautious about introducing a blue into their range. To avoid any mishaps, the Jensens supply the milk, which is made into wheels at the Hooks` creamery. The wheels are then transferred back over to the cellars at Hidden Springs for maturation. ccording to Brenda, the creation of Bohemian Blue was inspired by her Bohemian grandparents, Lucy and Louie Lastofka. Both were farmers and apparently lived up to the traditional bohemian reputation by generally disregarding conventional standards of behavior.Aged for six months before release, Bohemian Blue has a firm, slightly crumbly texture and balanced flavors that incorporate sweet and piquant notes.Drizzle this sheep`s milk blue with honey."

It’s documented that the area first became known for its goat cheeses with the arrival of the invading Saracen armies who brought with them everything from soldiers to livestock and, thankfully, their cheesemaking recipes. When they retreated, they left everything behind and their goats quickly adapted to their new environment and thrived on the rich, well-watered pastures of the region. Sicne the area is so well suited to dairy goats, there are many varieties of goats cheese made, including Bonde de Gâtine. Although some versions of Bonde de Gâtine sold in Europe frequently have a fine ash-coated rind and are made from raw milk, those for the export market are frequently pasteurized and lack the asj coating, Cheeses come in a 4oz, 2inch high cylinder and, during aging, develop a deeply furrowed rind. Bonde de Gâtine is most commonly eaten at about three or four weeks of age, when the interior paste is fudge-like and flavors are slightly salty with herbal, grassy notes and a fresh, clean lactic finish. (Pictured on right in photo.) However, if desired, the cheeses can be matured sucessfully for several more weeks, producing a smooth, dense texture, suitable for eating or grating.

Having spent time with a small-scale cheesemaker in Brittany during the 1970s, Allison was working as a state dairy lab technician in Vermont when she responded to a request from Bob Reese to produce some fresh chèvre for a state dinner. At the time, Bob was employed as marketing director for the Vermont Department of Agriculture. The chèvre was a hit and after some experimentation, Bob and Allison decided to go into production on a more formal basis, founding Vermont Creamery. Milk for cheese production comes from twenty-one family farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Quebec. Each farm has an average herd size of approximately 150 goats. Vermont Creamery makes a variety of fresh and young style cheeses and cultured dairy products, many of which are based on French recipes. They also make an outstanding cultured butter. Cheeses are made from either goat`s or cow`s milk. Bonne Bouche (which means literally ""good mouthful"" in French) is a delicate, ash-covered disc that made its first appearance in 2001. The cheese ismade using pasteurized milk, cultured and coagulated inbuckets using a slow lactic set. This allows for gentle curd development before they`recarefully ladled into disc-shaped molds and allowed to drain overnight, naturally and with no pressing. The following day, the young cheeses are removed from theirmolds, salted, and covered in a light coating of ash before being transferred to the drying room. They will spend a couple of days there to encourage development of a moldy rind. After drying, the discs areagain moved to to the aging room where they are matured for approximately ten days before release.Due to its size, style and shape, Bonne Bouche matures rapidly. It`s a very delicate cheese that needs to be consumed within a short window, when it`s at its best and ripest. At maturity, the rind is wrinkled and delicate grey in color with patches of white mold. It shouldn`t appear overly wet or sticky. The interior paste should be soft and yielding (not liquid) with bright, clean flavors of citrus and hay."

Judy has been making cheese since 1976, when she and her husband moved with their three young children from the suburbs to a hill farm in southern Indiana. They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great, great grandfather in the 1870s. Over the years, the suburbs have followed them and they are now the last working dairy in the county. Judy wanted to build a working model that others could follow, but since there were no guidelines for commercial goat dairying, they based their model, through trial and error, on an older, more traditional dairy, centered on herd health, longevity, productivity and on animals who are born, live, and die on the same farm. Judy`s goats comprise of Alpine, Saanen and Nubian breeds. Judy produces about a dozen different goat`s milk cheeses across a wide spectrum of styles. Capriole`s Bourbon Chocolate Hearts are made from fresh goat cheese blended with melted Callebaut chocolate, toasted pecans, and raisins soaked in Woodford Reserve Bourbon - as well as liberal additions of extra spirits. Somewhat unusual and in some ways more of a dessert, the resulting cheese is a subtle balance of sweet and tangy flavors that are not cloying or dense but definitely alcoholic. Bourbon Chocolate Hearts pair beautifully with nut breads, dried fruits, and fortified wines or bourbon."

The farm is a pasture-based dairy. No pesticides, herbicides or petroleum-based products are used on the fields. The cows graze on clovers, dandelion, trefoil, and a variety of grasses. The animals live outside during the grazing season, occasionally taking a break in the shade of the barn on hot, humid summer days. The Getzs make their own hay, and after composting the cow manure, spread it on the fields. Milking and cheesemaking are seasonal and take place from March to November when the cows are either grazing on pasture or being fed dry hay. Milk for cheesemaking is uncooled and transferred directly into the cheese room from the milking parlor - the perfect temperature to begin the cheese production process. Dancing Cow Farm produces four cheeses; Bourrée, Menuet, Sarabande and Lindy Hop. Named for a French peasant dance with rapid foot movements (inspired by the cows when they`re first turned out onto Spring pastures), Bourrée is made from raw milk and has a washed rind. At a young age, cheeses are moved to the Cellars at Jasper Hill for further aging, where they are rubbed with brine to encourage the growth of the Bacterium Linens culture and the washed rind. The interior paste of Bourrée is dense, smooth and supple with occasional small holes or ""eyes"" and is a pale straw color.

The name of the farm, ""La Colline aux Chèvres"" literally translates as “the hill of the goats”, and has long been renowned for the high quality milk produced from the herd of about 150 goats. Therefore, it was a natural extension for the family to create a variety of goat’s milk cheeses. In 2005, the cheesemaking operation moved to a larger facility at Carmaux, which allowed for an expansion of the business, while still maintaining small-batch cheese production. Made between Spring and Autumn, Bouyguette is made from raw goat’s milk and weighs approximately 3-4 oz (100g). For production, milk is slowly coagulated using a lactic fermentation process and the curd shaped by hand and wrapped in linen cloth. This gives each cheese its distinctive elongated shape, marked with the impression from the folds of fabric. Cheeses are allowed to drain, without pressing, for at least 24 hours before being transferred to maturing rooms. Each cheese is decorated with a sprig of rosemary on top. Bouyguette can be eaten young, when the interior is semi-soft and slightly chalky and the flavor relatively mild with delicate hints of rosemary and thyme. At an age of about three weeks, flavors intensify, becoming stronger with a more pronounced goat and barnyard taste. The rind of Bouyguette is pale ivory in color, tender and wrinkled. The interior texture is soft and delicate, becoming scoopable as the cheese matures. Bouyguette pairs well with a dry white wine such as Sancerre, Riesling or Chinon."
Bra Duro Vecchio,Various,Italy,"Cuneo, Piedmont","15 ins diameter, 4 ins high",17 lbs approx,,GoatSheepCow,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced in the lowland dairies surrounding the town of Bra, in Northern Italy, Bra Duro is made with milk sourced from the local breed of Razza Piedmontese cow. The word ""duro"" means rough, or rugged in Italian, and refers to the rustic appearance of the rind. According to AOC (name protected) rules, milk for production must be drawn from two milkings on the same day and can occasionally include the addition of either goat`s or sheep`s milk. For cheesemaking, milk is coagulated with the addition of liquid calf rennet at a temperature of 80.6°-89.6°F. Although a small number of cheeses are produced from raw milk, the majority are pasteurized. For pasteurized cheeses, a commercial starter, usually made with a mix of thermophilic and mesophilic lactic bacteria, is used, although generally each producer uses a slightly different starter to characterize their production. The curd is cut twice in a circular movement that ultimately produces granules about the size of rice grains. After draining, curds are put in molds and pressed for at least five or six hours before being dry-salted (salt applied to the rind) for three days per side. There are several variations of Bra that have been developed over the years: Bra Tenero (a soft, young version), Bra Stravecchio (super-aged), and Bra Ciucco (rubbed in wine). Bra Duro Vecchio is aged for about six months, which produces a firm cheese with mellow, toasty aromas and a hard, golden-brown colored rind. The texture is dense and compact with occasional small ""eyes,"" or holes, and is straw-colored. Flavors are mild and lactic with notes of fruit and hazelnuts, and a pleasantly long, grassy finish. Bra Duro pairs best with one of the region`s wines such as Gamay, Barbera, and Nebbiolo."

In the Kosters’ warehouse, wheels are tended and matured for six to nine months as they age in a white wax exterior before being released and sold. Betty matures her goudas at higher humidity levels and temperatures than other gouda producers—up to 60 degrees Fahrenheit—which allows crystals to form while preserving moistness in the fudgy white paste.Ivory-colored, creamy Brabander is a definite crowd-pleaser. It’s got barely a trace of the goaty aromas that turn some people away from chèvres, instead yielding a caramel-butterscotch flavor that’s perfectly balanced with salt, creaminess, and a hint of acidity.Brabander is fun and easy to pair. It’s delicious alongside a cherry lambic beer. We also love Brabander with Potlicker Kitchen’s Burgundy Anise Wine Jelly—it marries well with the cheese’s brighter notes, while its bittersweet licorice kick highlights toasty caramel flavors. For a pairing emphasizing like-flavors, drizzle it in goat’s milk Salted Bourbon caramel from Fat Toad Farm. "
Braided Caciocavera,Lovera's Market,United States,Oklahoma,,8 oz and 16 oz packages,www.loverasmarket.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Smoked,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Caciocavallo is a traditional Italian stretched-curd cheese that originated in the southern Italian provinces of Abruzzo, Calabria and Campania. The name translates literally as ‘horse cheese,’ and while its meaning has been debated for centuries, it’s probably derived from the traditional method of transport; cheeses would be suspended like saddlebags across a horse’s flank for the journey down the mountain. Caciocavallo, which belongs to the same family as Mozzarella and Provolone, was traditionally stretched and shaped by hand—a tradition that Lovera’s Market continues in their production of the cheese today. When Sam Lovera was a young boy in Krebs, Oklahoma, he was taught the traditional method of Caciocavalloa production by local Southern Italian immigrants. Today Lovera’s Market produces a range of ‘Caciocaveras,’ their signature Caciocavallo-inspired cheeses formed into gourd shapes as well as a braided shape. Braiding the cheese is a great trick for giving it more surface area, thus speeding up and enhancing the conditioning process. Sam Lovera’s son-in-law Sean Duffy is now the head cheesemaker at Lovera’s Market. His smooth, stringy cheese has won accolades for its nutty caramel notes.With a dense, chewy mouthfeel and a great smoked flavor, the hickory-smoked Caciocavera is the beef jerky of cheese. It has a smoky finish plus nutty, caramel, slightly buttery flavors that hold throughout. According to Duffy, a fun way to eat the cheese is to undo the braid and peel apart the ropes like gourmet string cheese. Sam Lovera suggests pairing the cheese with a dry red wine. We think itmelts beautifully and adds a smoky kick to your favorite sandwich, burger, pizza or even macaroni and cheese."

Living in Waco, Texas in the traditional agricultural and crafts community Homestead Heritage, Rebeccah was looking for a way to use some extra spring milk that the community’s Brown Swiss cows had been producing. Using books and experimentation, she gradually began producing dairy products, hard and soft cheeses, eventually teaching her craft to others. In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheeses are raw milk cheeses. Brazos Select is a mold-ripened cheese produced in brie style. One day after the cheese is made, wheels are painted with sorghum and wrapped in mesquite wood. After sufficient white mold has grown, grape leaves are placed on top and the wheels are aged until they are a total of 60 days old.Smelling sweet and boozy, a bit like beer and honey, this caramel-colored cheese has a firm, creamy, melt-in-the-mouth texture. Flavor is very complex, tasting a bit like mead and grapes, with woody and smoky background notes. Aftertaste is a bit bitter on the back of the tongue, and hints of soil and minerals are present.Marc Kuehl suggests pairing Brazos Select with crispy water crackers, but also says that the cheese is complex enough to enjoy alone."
Bread Cheese (Carr Valley),Carr Valley Cheese Co,United States,Wisconsin,"6 ins long, 4 ins wide, 1 in high",10 oz,www.carrvalleycheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,None,,,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese Co. remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties, as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1908. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Carr Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, eventually purchasing another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Bread cheese is Carr Valley’s twist on the traditional Finnish cheese Leipäjuusto. Once the curds have been separated from the whey, they are put into molds to drain. It is then baked in the oven, like bread, where the outside of the cheese caramelizes to a dark brown crust. This version of the cheese came in 3rd at the 2012 World Champion Cheese Competition.Bread Cheese is designed to be eaten warm. Place the cheese in a heated in a non-stick skillet or frying pan and heat until each side is browned nicely and the texture of the cheese has softened. Bread Cheese has a milky flavor with a bit of salt, and a springy texture that squeaks against the teeth. The browned crust lends a slight nuttiness to its otherwise mild flavor.In Finland, bread cheese is enjoyed warm with coffee, and served with jam. Why break from tradition? It can also be served with honey or maple syrup, or as an addition to salads such as Panzanella."
Breakfast Cheese,Marin French Cheeese Co.,United States,California,"2 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",4 oz,www.marinfrenchcheese.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Fresh,,,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the Marin French Cheese Company was founded in1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Marin French, also known as Rouge et Noir, is the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. Marin French specializes in the production of young and soft ripened cheeses. For production of Breakfast Cheese, fresh milk is pasteurized and poured into several hundred individual 20 gallon `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then about 45 minutes later, the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.) With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. By the time the curd from each bucket has been put into the molds, the first cheeses are ready to be flipped for the first time. This manoever allows for the even distribution of moisture and drainage. The cheeses are turned again 2 hours later and then left to drain overnight. After 14 hours the cheeses are unmolded and transferred to the brining room where they are brined for between 30-120 minutes. They are then placed on racks to dry for between 12-24 hours. Breakfast Cheese is released at a very young age - 72 hours. As such, it is classified as a fresh cheese. The texture of the Brakfast Cheese is firm with a slightly dense and slightly clay-like mouthfeel. The color of the paste is ivory white. Flavors are of salt and cream, with a slight citrus tang."
Brebis (Blackberry Farms),Blackberry Farms,United States,Tennessee,,8 oz or 16 oz,http://www.blackberryfarm.com/,Sheep,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,Rindless,Fresh,," Brebis is the French word for “ewe,” aschèvre is the word for “goat.” And this cheese is similar to what we Americans tend to call fresh chèvre—soft, un-ripened, spreadable—except that it’s made with sheep’s milk. Despite some similarities, the creamier sheepy origins of Brebis make it unique: imagine the texture of a ricotta combined with the tanginess of a yogurt. It’s one of several cheeses produced on “The Farmstead” at Blackberry Farm, part of a luxury hotel in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee. Situated on a parcel in the 4,200-acre estate, the farm generates heirloom produce, wild flower honey, eggs, and artisan cheeses, using the sustainably harvested ingredients in the hotel’s restaurants. Guests at the property are encouraged to participate in the farm’s activities.Fluffy white Brebis smells like yogurt and is fittingly super tangy on the palate, with strong lemon oil notes and a sweet aftertaste.We’d slather this all over a poppyseed bagel or simply serve it alongside strawberries drizzled with honey. Blackberry Farm’s cheesemakers also suggest experimenting with Brebis in the kitchen: spooning it into a sautéed mushroom cap and topping it with smoked trout, forming it into a ball and rolling it in ground pistachios, or using it in your griddlecake batter."
Brebis Blanche,3 Corner Field Farm,United States,New York,"1.5 ins diameter, 2 ins high",4oz,www.dairysheepfarm.com,Sheep,,Soft,Animal,None,,,"Owned by Karen Weinberg and her husband Paul Borghard, 3 Corner Field Farm is a sheep dairy and cheesemaking operation located in the Battenkill Valley, near Shushan, New York. Both formerly from Manhattan, Karen and Paul bought the farm in 1990, and now run a flock of 120 East Friesian milking sheep on the property. The sheep are rotationally grazed and moved to fresh pasture every 24 hours. Karen and Paul have worked hard to develop and manage the grazing, providing a wide variety of forage such as clovers, fescue, trefoil, wild oregano, timothy and cattails to enhance the animals` diet and improve milk quality. In addition to cheesemaking, Karen and Paul also sell their lambs, wool and soaps at a number of Farmers Markets that they regularly attend. During the season which runs from April to September, the sheep are milked twice each day. Every morning, Karen combines cooled milk from the previous evening`s milking with the warm, fresh milk from the morning`s milking to make cheese. Karen makes a variety of cheeses, as well as a sheep`s milk yogurt. The cheeses include the camembert-style Shushan Snow, Feta, and two versions of an aged, Basque-style sheep`s milk cheese called Battenkill Brebis, one of which is smoked and called Frere Fumant. Brebis Blanche is a fresh lactic style cheese. This means that the evening before production, cultured milk is allowed to sit out overnight in order to develop the lactic acid necessary for cheesemaking. The following morning a curd has formed, which is then gently ladled into small 4 ounce molds or plastic containers and allowed to drain naturally. The resulting cheese is fresh, sweet and tangy with full, milky flavors. The texture is fine and smooth, yet dense and rich. Brebis Blanche is available in plain, lavender, and French herb flavors."
Brescianella Stagionata,Affineur - Guffanti,Italy,Lombardy,"6 ins square, 1-2 ins high",1.8 lbs,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced in Lombardy, southeast of Milan, Brescianella Stagionata is an un-cooked, lightly pressed, cow`s milk cheese made from pasteurized milk. Named for the town of Brescia that lies at the center of the cheese`s production, Brescianella Stagionata is very similar in look and taste to Taleggio. Like Taleggio, Brescianella is washed in a brine solution, which gives the cheese its bright orange, slightly sticky rind. Because the cheese is aged for around 90 days on straw, it has deep linear indentations in the rind that can take on a brown hue. Maturation of the cheese requires skill and judgement since, due to the style of the cheese, there is a relatively short time span between when the cheese is ready to eat and when it becomes overly mature.However, careful aging results in an ivory-white interior paste that is smooth and yielding with occasional small eyes dotted throughout. Aromas can be intense and slightly sweet. Brescianella’s flavors are rich and milky, with notes of vanilla and hazelnuts, and sweet with a lingering grassy aftertaste.Beverage pairing suggestions include sweet white wines and lagers. Food pairings include fresh fruit and warm bread. It can be used in cooking as a melting cheese in polenta or risotto."
Bresse Bleu,Fromagerie Bresse Bleu/ Bongrain,France,Rhône-Alpes,,"5 oz, 8 oz, 12 oz",,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,BlueSoft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Bresse Bleu is a creamy blue cheese with a bloomy rind. It’s produced in the Rhône-Alpes area of France under the direction of the Bongrain dairy company. The history of Bongrain dates back to 1920 in Illoud, France, when Jean- Noel Bongrain, then only 19 years of age, inherited the small family business of Fromagerie d’Illoud (as it was then called). By the early 1950’s, Bongrain began to develop the family business in a new direction, seeking to break away from the traditional French cheeses. Jean- Noel‘s vision was to produce a nationally-branded cheese, an idea that was unheard of at the time in France. He wanted to create recipes that would not only be unique in taste but could be reproduced throughout the various regions of France. The first cheese to be made along these lines was ‘Caprice des Dieux’, first produced in 1950. Having penetrated the French market, Bongrain then launched further afield, and by 1960 was selling cheese in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Today, Bongrain is France’s second largest cheese and dairy producer and 5th largest in the world. The group currently operates production facilities in 24 counties. Many cheeses are distributed in the United States under the Ile de France brand name. Bresse Bleu, one of Bongrain’s nationally-branded cheeses, is a cross between a blue cheese and a Camembert. In production, Penicillium roqueforti (the mold used in production of Roquefort and other blue cheeses) is introduced to the curds before molding. After molding, the small rounds are rubbed with Penicillium camemberti, the mold responsible for Camembert’s fuzzy white coating.Aged for 2-4 weeks, Bresse Bleu has a soft, spreadable cream-colored paste with patches of blue-green veining. It’s less salty and less pungent than other blue cheeses, making it a good choice for those usually wary of blues. Taste is lactic with aromas of mushrooms and a slight kick of spiciness from the blue veins.Pair it with a Sauternes, a Chablis or a Burgundy red."
Briana,Jacobs & Brichford,United States,Indiana,,20-23 lbs,jandbcheese.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Washed,Alpine-style,," This fontina-style beauty is aged for a minimum of 90 days, or as long as 10 months—if it doesn’t sell out first. With a semi-firm texture and easy meltability, Briana is a versatile cheese that can accompany appetizers, main courses, and even desserts.  In the heart of Southeastern Indiana’s Whitewater Valley, on a farm that has been in the Brichford family since 1819, Jacobs & Brichford Farmstead Cheese produces raw milk cheeses from their own grass-fed cows. Their herd of Jersey, Normande, and Tarantaise cross cows are grazed through fresh pastures every day, and the dairy follows nature’s milking rhythm, operating on a seasonal basis.  In the mid-1990s the farm—run by Leslie Jacobs and Matthew Brichford—transitioned from raising beef cattle to dairying. In 2010, after years of studying cheesemaking, they built their cheese plant and sold their first products two years later. A family venture, Matthew Brichford manages the farm and makes the cheese, while Leslie Jacobs takes care of marketing with their daughter Maize while daughter Miah handles milking and grazing management.  Briana was released in 2012 as a complement to Jacob and Brichford’s Alpine style cheese, Everton. This fontina style is a washed curd cheese, which involves washing the cheese curds before salting them in the earlier stages of the cheesemaking process. Briana is also a smear-ripened cheese, meaning thebacteria and fungi growing on more mature wheels are intentionally spread to the younger wheels, spreading their rich, nutty, complex flavors.Similar to fontina, Briana is rich and creamy with a smooth herbaceous body, slight nutty notes, and mild funk. Hints of fresh fruit add a kick of acidity and a subtle sweetness without overwhelming the palate. Briana’s subtle nutty and fruity notes pair well with grapes and a variety of nuts. Briana can also stand up well to roasted meats;try it with a simple garlic and herb roasted pork tenderloin and a fruity Willamette Valley pinot noir."
Briar Summit,Nettle Meadow Farm and Artisan Cheese,United States,New York,,,www.nettlemeadow.com,SheepCowGoat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to paste,"This mountain-shaped cheese appropriately hails from near the Adirondack Mountains of New York, on a dairy run by Sheila Flanagan and Lorraine Lambiase. Nettle Meadow’s origins date back to 1993, when Raynald Hebert and his wife Laurie Goodheart transformed an old farmstead into a small cheesemaking facility and enough acreage to support approximately thirty goats. Its name was a reflection of the wild nettles and herbs that made up the goats’ diet.  Twelve years after its founding, the farm was sold to Flanagan and Lambaise, both of whom had been living in California and were seeking a complete change of direction. Since 2005 they have worked extensively to expand the operation. Now spanning 75 acres, it is home to over 360 Alpine, Nubian, Saanen and mixed breed goats, several dozen East Freisian sheep and a variety of other farm animals currently cared for by the farm’s sanctuary. In 2017, estimated cheese production will be about 150,000 pounds of cheese. Sheila and Lorraine are passionate supporters of the farming lifestyle, the human care of animals and artisan cheese and run the farm with the assistance of Shiela’s mother Joan together with eighteen employees.  During an uneventful food show several years ago, Sheila Flanagan’s mind began wandering. “To keep myself entertained,” she remembers, “I was thinking about how I might add a creamy twist to our three-milk cheese.” The resulting pyramid—Briar Summit—combines milk from the farm’s own goats and sheep along with cow’s milk and cream from nearby Willow Marsh Farm. In tune with their reputation for unique flavorings, Flanagan and partner Lorraine Lambiase add raspberry leaf tea to the milk when pasteurizing. The bloomy rind isn’t fruity, but its lush creaminess carries whispers of the woods and herbal notes from the briar patch. New York’s Bedford Cheese Shop owner Charlotte Kamin appreciates the pyramid’s delicateness. “The infusion of tea is like a waft of flowers as opposed to an aggressive perfume.” Briar Summit is best savored without embellishment alongside an effervescent, traditional dry Champagne."
Brick,Widmer's Cheese Cellars,United States,Wisconsin,11 in x 3 in x 2¾ in,5 lbs,www.widmerscheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Crafted in a small factory in the town of Teresa, Wisconsin, Widmer`s Brick is a true American original. Joe Widmer`s family has been making cheese here since his grandfather, John Widmer, arrived from Switzerland more than 80 years ago. Joe started helping out in the cheese plant at the age of six, and despite leaving school to pursue a career in rock and roll, he ultimately returned to the business and gained his cheesemaker`s license. Today, he`s a certified Wisconsin Master Cheesemaker. Milk for production comes from several local dairies, most of which have a very long-standing relationship with Widmer`s. In fact, one farm has sold milk to the cheese plant for three generations. Widmer`s adheres closely to the traditional Wisconsin cheesemaking methods, particularly when it comes to brick cheese. Crafted first in 1877 by John Jossi, a Swiss-born immigrant cheesemaker, brickwas conceived as similar to Limburger but made with a with drier curd and with lower levels of Brevibacteriumlinens, a microbe that encourages a orange-hued rind. The cheese was also pressed using bricks. While many industrially-produced cheeses today call themselves ‘brick,’ Widmer’s claims to be the only producer making authentic brick according to its traditional recipe. For pressing the cheese, Joe even uses the same bricks that his grandfather used. His Aged Brick versionis washed regularly with a mixture of brine, cultures, and whey during its aging period, which takes place in a warm (70 degree) room for up to four months.During aging, Widmer’s starts out mild and sweet, later developing a pungent, full aroma due to its repeated washings. The flavor that develops with age is modest yet increasingly full, buttery and savory.Pair it with a cabernet or with a dark beer, such as a stout."

The original business, Zingerman`s Delicatessen, founded in March of 1982 by Paul Saginaw and Ari Weinzweig, still resides in an historic building near the Ann Arbor Farmers` Market, and over the years has gained a national reputation for its great food and great business model. Despite pressure to expand via franchise, Zingerman`s has resisted opening up more branches. Instead they have chosen to create other stand-alone food production enterprises, in the process creating Zingerman`s Creamery. Zingerman`s Creamery is headed by John Loomis, and the cheeses John makes are either from cow`s or goat`s milk, sourced from local dairies. The range largely consists of mold ripened and fresh cheeses, each with their own variation. Made from pasteurized cow`s milk and added cream, Bridgewater is studded with freshly ground Telicherry black peppercorns to give it an extra kick. The combination of the pepper and the natural citrus flavors of the cheese produce clean, bright flavors that wake up the taste buds without being overly assertive. The exterior of this sphere-shaped cheese is covered with a white, bloomy rind, through which the black pepper specks peak through."

He specializes, among other cheeses, in AOC-certified Bries, including Brie de Meaux, Brie de Melun and several variations such as Coulommiersand Brie Noir. The practice of sending fresh cheeses to an affineur is historically common in this region, where the tough clay-filled soil made it difficult for every small farmer to dig out his own cheese cave. Above Stéphane`s temperature and humidity-controlled caves, he runs a small Brie museum filled with old farmingimplements, where guests can learn about the history of cheesemaking in the region. Right after salting, Stéphane slices the fresh version of what would otherwise become a Brie de Meaux in half and sandwiches in some local mustard. The cheese is then aged like a regular Brie de Meaux, a bloomy white rind developing as the paste becomes increasingly soft and creamy, sealing the mustard inside.After 5-8 weeks of aging, the cheese has a thick white rind surrounding an oozing straw-colored layer. That in turn surrounds a fluffy, buttery layer containing the mustard, whose tanginess stands up well to the creaminess of the cheese.Pair it with a red Burgundy wine."

In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheesesare raw milk cheeses.Grassy and barnyardy on the nose, but mild and slightly salty on the palate, this cheese exhibits a hint of milky sweetness and some bitter notes with a mineraly aftertaste. While buttery, its texture is different than what one might expect from a brie; it’s much firmer and doesn’t ooze at room temperature. Rind is thick and inflexible, so you can pick up a piece from one end without worrying that it will break.Co-owner Marc Kuehl likes to pair this Brie with honey and pecans or blueberry-lavender jam. For a more adventurous concoction, he suggests that it also makes a great grilled cheese sandwich wedged in with strawberries, basil, turkey bacon and blueberry-infused balsamic."
Brie de Meaux,Various,France,Ile de France,"14-15 ins diameter,  2 ins high",5.5 - 6.5 lbs,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Produced in the region of Brie, located just to the east of Paris, Brie de Meaux dates back to Roman times. This classic Frenchcheese has been consistently loved for at least 400 years, but it rose to popularity during the 19th century, largely thanks to the French statesman Talleyrand, who introduced it at a diplomats` dinner. As a result, it was considered by many to be the finest cheese in Europe. Granted AOC (name protected) status in 1980, Brie de Meaux`s affinage, or maturation, must take place within specified regions of Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, Aube, Marne, Haut-Marne, Meuse, and Yonne, though it is made by many producers. The region`s proximity to Paris has undoubtedly helped Brie de Meaux`s widespread appeal and reputation. Made with raw cow`s milk, Brie de Meaux can be produced either industrially or artisanally. Theprocess requires very gentle handling of the curd to allow for maximum moisture retention within the curd. Cheeses are allowed to drain under their own weight, and surface moisture rapidly evaporates due to the large flat shape of the cheese. When ripe, Brie de Meaux should be covered with a white bloomy rind that results from thePenicillium Candidum mold. With age, the white mold frequently becomes dotted with patches of red or brown. The best time to eat Brie de Meaux is when at least half the thickness of the cheese is ripe, soft, and yielding, with an interior color of straw. Brought to room temperature, its paste is smooth and velvety.Brie de Meaux is sweet and buttery, reflecting the high-quality of the milk used in production. Expect notes of mushrooms and almonds and milky, rich aromas.Pair with mellow white wines like chardonnay, fruity red like Chinon, or blonde ales."
Brie de Melun,Various,France,Ile de France,"10-11 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",3.5 - 4 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Brie de Melun and the more famous Brie de Meaux, are both produced in the region of northern France known as Ile de France. However, whereas Brie de Meaux posseses refined flavors and a soft texture, Brie de Melun is smaller in size and tends to be a more robust cheese, often quite salty and with a firmer texture. The reason for these differences lies in the way each is made. Production of Brie de Meaux is relatively fast (about 30 minutes) because the milk is coagulated with the addition of rennet. On the other hand, Brie de Melun is made using lactic fermentation, a process whereby milk is allowed to ripen for a period of approximately 18 hours, at which point is has formed a gel-like curd. Wheels of Brie de Melun are also matured for a minimum of four weeks and often up to seven or eight - considerably longer than Brie de Meaux which is often released after about three weeks.Aromas of Brie de Melun are slightly musty and straw-like. The texture is semi-firm and while still classified as a mold-ripened cheese, the exterior rind has a tendency to be slightly dry - especially in older wheels. As mentioned above, flavors are robustly lactic and slightly salty, with a gentle barnyard finish and subtle sour notes. The best cheeses are often made between June and October.Brie de Melun pairs well with red Burgundy, Chilean Merlot or a southern French Syrah."
Brie (Marin French Cheese),Marin French Cheese,United States,California,4 in diameter x 1½ in height,8 oz,www.marinfrenchcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the Marin French Cheese Company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. To make the cheese, cow`s milk is pasteurized and poured into `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.) With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. The cheeses are unmolded and brined, then placed on racks to dry before they’re transferred to the aging rooms where they will spend 10-14 days before release. The cheeses are turned once during this time to promote mold growth.Marin French Cheese’s Brie is very mild with only gentle notes of grass and butter. Its rind is thin and white, while its paste is buttery and rich with a pale golden color.Pair it with a California sauvignon blanc, a wheat beer or a hard cider."
Brie Noir,Fromagerie Ganot,France,Ile de France,"9 ins diameter, 1 in height",3.5 lbs,www.fermes-brie.fr,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Brie Noir is a super-aged version of Brie. The cheese, which is rarely found outside its native Seine et Mare region of France, usually starts out as Brie de Meaux or Brie de Melun. These two mold-ripened AOC cheeses are normally aged for up to 5 and 10 weeks respectively, while a Brie Noir can be aged for up to two years. One version of Brie Noir can be found at Fromagerie Ganot in Jouarre, where fifth-generation affineur Stéphane Gay refines cheeses from throughout the region. Gay points out that he has some help in aging his Brie Noir from “artisans,” or cheese mites, who live in the cave and chew up some of the cheese’s crust. During aging, he turns and brushes the surface occasionally so that the mites don’t degrade the surface too quickly. Ater purchasing, Brie Noir can be conserved at home in the refrigerator for two or three months. Because it travels better than traditional Brie, Stéphane says that the cheese is especially popular among his Japanese visitors.The odor and appearance of his one-year-aged Brie de Melun is so aggressive that the taste comes as a pleasant surprise; it’s pungent yet still creamy, with aromas of porcini mushrooms, undergrowth and roasted nuts.Scrape some of the rind off before eating, and try dunking it in coffee."

Brillat Savarin is one of France`s classic triple créme cheeses. Production is industrial, and the cheeses are made by three dairies located in the Ile de France region; Fromagerie Fermiere de Juchy, Societe Fromagere de la Brie or Rouzaire`s Fromagerie de Pre-Foret. Cheeses like Brillat Savarin that are classified as triple créme must have a fat content of at least 75%. This is achieved by adding cream to whole milk during production. Young cheeses, before they have developed their typical white, bloomy rind, taste similar to eating fresh cream. However, cheeses are usually matured for about four or five weeks, at which stage they have slightly more complexity. The predominant flavors are of butter, salt and cream, accompanied by hints of mushrooms, hazelnuts and occasionally truffles. The interior paste is buttery-white in color with a dense, moist and slightly chalky texture. Brillat Savarin pairs very well with light fruity white wines or Champagne."
Brin d'Amour,Various,Corsica,,"4 ins diameter, 2 ins high",1 lb,,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Animal,HerbedFlavoredNatural,,,"Made in Corsica from the milk of Lacaune ewes, Brin D`Amour is made by small-scale producers and shepherds on the island. The version of Brin d`Amour known as Fleur de Maquis, is very similar but prouced on a slightly larger scale. The name Brin d`Amour means ""a breath of love,"" and refers to the aromatic coating of rosemary, fennel seeds, juniper berries, and the occasional bird`s eye chile applied during production to enhance the natural flavors present in the milk. The sheep freely browse Corsica`s scrubby Mediterranean landscape. When young, Brin d`Amour is firm and moist with citrus flavors and a slightly sour tang. With age, the rind becomes dotted with a blue-grey mold. The texture of the cheese also becomes softer, absorbing the savory and herbaceous flavors of the rind. Flavors strike a delicate balance, with the herbs enhancing the warm, bright, sheepy quality of the interior paste. If allowed to mature fully, the pate breaks down and becomes runny and stronger tasting. This cheese pairs well with many types of wines and especially with Tempranillo and Albarino."

The history of the company dates back to the early 1900s, when Ernesto Carpenedo began working as a “casoin” (a word in local dialect for a cheesemonger) in a shop in the village of Preganziol. Ernesto eventually founded his own company, which is today run by his son Antonio and his grandsons Ernesto and Alessandro, who have over thirty years of experience in the dairy-cheese sector. Antonio has been devoting his attention to affinage since 1976, the year that he began steeping his first rounds of cheese in wine, giving birth to La Casearia’s signature Ubriaco (which translates into “drunken”).  Briscola is aged for four months and dunked in Barbera wine and marc, giving the rind a purple color that surrounds a paste containing sporadic eyelets.Savory, medium in intensity and with a slightly spicy, fruity aftertaste, aromas of Briscola are reminiscent of cherries and pepper. Notes of buttermilk and hay can also be detected.Pair it with a Barbera or with a Sauvignon Blanc."

Since 2014 the creamery has been owned by chefs Greg Tatis and Monica Jaramillo, who specialize in recipe development and cheesemaking, as well as by Pete and Heather Holmes, who specialize in sales and marketing. The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw and thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. Brittany’s Blue Brie is a flavored version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park. Described as a cross between a brie and a farm cheese, the production process for these these bloomy-rinded discs is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling. To make this version, discs are sliced in half and a delicate layer of Penicillium roqueforti culture is added. Discs are then aged from three to four weeks.The thin layer of blue mold contributes a very subtle blue cheese flavor to this well-balanced, mild cheese.

Broad River Blue,Nature’s Harmony Farmstead Cheese,United States,Georgia,"7 in diameter, 6 in height",6-7 lbs,www.naturesharmonyfarm.com,Cow,,Blue,Microbial,Natural,BlueCheddar-like,,"In 2007, Tim and Liz Young quit their corporate careers and left behind their home in suburban Atlanta. Hoping to reconnect with the land, animals and food, they moved to rural Georgia and became first-time farmers. Tim and Liz started milking cows and making cheese in 2010. They’d originally just wanted the whey to feed their rare breed Ossabaw Island pigs, but soon fell in love with the cheesemaking process. Today they make a variety of cheeses using only raw milk from their small herd of Jersey cows. The cows graze on organic grasses and hay, and have access to outdoor pastures each day of the year. The Youngs focus on small batches of handmade cheese; milk is stirred by hand, curds are cut and hooped by hand, and aging wheels are brushed, washed, and turned by hand. Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons. Broad River Blue is the summertime version of Elberton Blue; while Elberton Blue is made from rich, fatty winter milk, Broad River Blue is made during warm months, when the cows are grazing on lush pasture. Tim and Liz heat the milk to 90 degrees Farenheit, add starter cultures and a sprinkling of blue mold, and then add rennet. After cutting the curds, the Youngs bend over the vat to stir and fluff them, allowing for openness inside the cheese once it’s hooped. After hooping they flip the cheese hourly, and begin salting the following day. A few days later the wheels are pierced to allow air to interact with the blue mold. Wheels are then flipped and brushed daily until they’re ready for sale at 75-90 days.Broad River Blue is an approachable, uncomplicated blue cheese. It has a high butterfat content, minerality and deep vegetal flavors.Try pairing Broad River Blue with a Sancerre, or another minerally Sauvignon Blanc."
Brocciu,Various,France,Corsica,,0.5-0.6 lbs,www.aoc-brocciu.com,SheepGoat,,Soft,Animal,,,,"According to Corsican legend, there was once an ogre, the “Orcu”, who lived in the mountains and terrorized villagers. One day, a young shepherd fashioned a trap—a giant leather boot filled with a sticky substance—which he left outside the Orcu’s cave. Sure enough, the ogre got stuck in the boot, and in his struggle to escape, toppled over. As the shepherds rushed at him to attack, he offered them a secret in exchange for his life: a recipe for a cheese he invented, which he called Brocciu. Since then, Brocciu has played an integral role in Corsican life and cuisine. “Who has not tasted it, does not know the island,” wrote Bergerat in the late 19th century. Today it is the only Corsican cheese with French AOC status. Brocciu is a soft, fresh cheese made from sheep`s or goat`s milk whey. As the whey heats up, some fresh milk is added (up to 25% volume can be fresh milk, according to AOC regulations). When the whey and milk reach about 170 degrees farenheit, the curds (known locally as ‘Fattoghje casgiaghe’), begin floating to the top. The cheesemaker scoops curds out and allows them to drain in a small basket mold. The soft cheese can be consumed a few hours after cooling and draining, or it can be refined over several weeks. Once the cheese has aged for 21 days, it becomes classified as “Brocciu Passu.” The ideal consumption period is from November to June. About 500 tons of Brocciu are produced in Corsica each year. Brocciu is similar to ricotta, although with a slightly stronger tang. It is creamy, smooth, fragile and a bit sweet. Pairings:Brocciu is usually eaten after a meal, perhaps alongside chestnut liquer and sugar, or with fig jam or coffee. It is also great for cooking and is often added to omelets alongside mint, in stuffed zucchini or tomatoes, in beignets, or in a custard baked with lemon zest (fiadone). Photo by Pierre Bona"
Buche,Juniper Grove Farm,United States,Oregon,"4-5 ins long, 2 ins diameter",7 oz,www.junipergrovefarm.com,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Owned and run by Pierre Kolisch, Juniper Grove Farm is located on the eastern side of the Cascade Mountain Range, a stunningly beautiful area in Oregon. The farm was established in 1985 and is home to a herd of 110 goats and a small, vibrant farmstead cheesemaking operation. The goats browse the pastures surrounding the dairy year round, eating shrubs, grass, and alfalfa. Since the geology in this region reflects its volcanic past, the soil is particularly rich in minerals, which is reflected in the flavor of the milk and Juniper Grove`s cheeses. An attorney by training, later in life Pierre decided to pursue his passion for cheese. Having acquired the farm, he worked in Normandy by apprenticing with Camembert cheesemaker, François Durand, and also earned a degree at the National Dairy School in Poligny before returning to the United States in 1987. Pierre makes a range of farmstead goat cheeses largely inspired by French recipes, and uses European methods. Buche is an 8oz cheese formed in the shape of a log with a straw of wheat running horizontally through the middle. The straw is not only decorative, as it helps to prevent the fragile log from breaking. The Buche`s characteristic soft, wrinkly rind is a result of the geotricum candidim mold that helps to ripen the cheese. It is a mold frequently used in France for the production of young goat`s milk cheeses. The texture of Juniper Grove`s Buche is soft, moist and delicately fluffy. As the cheeses age, they become softer and runnier under the rind, while the center remains slightly firmer. Flavors are rich and citrus-like, with notes of grass and hazelnuts. With age, Buche can develop a pronounced tang and become quite assertive."

The farm and creamery are fully powered with renewable solar energy via a large array of solar panels – one of many sustainability programs Redwood Hill Farm & Creamery has in place.Bucheret illustrates how goat milk cheese changes as it matures. As a young cheese, it has tangy and bright flavors with a white, chalky paste. As it begins to mature, it develops a buttery flavor and a viscous texture just under the rind while maintaining a dense inner paste. When fully mature, Bucheret tastes like roasted nuts and mushrooms and the paste has a smooth texture.Pairing suggestions include Dry Rose, Sparkling Wine, Sauvignon Blanc, or Pinot Noir."

Solandt grew up in France in the town of Montauban, where his grandmother owned a creamery. His father worked for Tempé-Lait before starting his own business representing French cheese manufacturers to various export markets including the USA. It was the dominance of the cheese market in the US that persuaded Solandt’s father to move his family out to the United States in 1983. Having effectively grown up surrounded by the cheese business, it was no surprise when three years later Arnaud was approached by Michel Betin, one of the principle French Manufacturers to asked him to help with his company that was undergoing a difficult transition. Arnaud accepted and moreover, was the driving force behind shifting the company’s focus from importing French cheeses to developing a cheesemaking business that specialized in French style cheeses. Montchevré’s Head Cheesemaker is Jean Rossard also grew up in France surrounded by a world of cheese. Jean’s father was a cheese maker and his babysitter was the truck driver who collected the milk for his father – often with Jean in the seat beside him. Today, cheesemaking at Montchevré takes place within a large 110,000 sq. ft building and the company produces over 250,000 pounds of goat cheese each week. The first cheeses they made were the Cabrie, the Chevriotte and the Chevre in Blue. Milk is sourced from mixed breed goats located at over 300 farms across Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri. Inspired by the French Bucheron which was one of the first French goat cheeses to be exported into the United States, the expertese of the original French manufacturer was passed on to Montchevre so they could make their own version in the US.With its ivory colored rind and interior, Montchevre’s Bucheron are aged for between 5-10 weeks before release. The resulting cheese has a variety of flavors. When young, cheeses have a dense and slightly crumbly center with tangy, sharp notes and flavors of mushrooms. With age, the paste of the cheese begins to break down under the rind, producing a gooey layer in contrast to the cheese’s firmer center.Bucheron pairs well with a red Bordeaux or a wide variety of white wines including dessert wines such as Sauternes. Bucheron makes a good addition to cheese platters or salads or simply enjoyed with a warm slice of fresh, wholegrain bread."

Rhonda and Roy Gothberg bought the property in 2001. At the time, it was a former cow dairy that had become run-down, so they initiated a program of extensive repairs and renovations with a view to making it suitable for a dairy goat farm and creamery. The first goats arrived at Gothberg in April 2002. Having originally started with two does, Rhonda quickly found that she had more milk than the family could consume and decided to try her hand at making cheese. Encouraged by the results, she was inspired to continue. After completing the Cheesemakers’ Short Course at Washington State University, she set about the construction of a new barn and cheesemaking facility. Milk is sourced from Gothberg Farm’s own herd of 20 milking purebred LaMancha goats; a breed known for its quality milk that contains high levels of fat and protein. At any given time there are about 50 LaMancha goats on the farm. This includes the milking does, non-milking does, kids, and bucks. Rhonda produces a wide variety of hand crafted cheeses at Gothberg Farms using her 52 gallon vat pasteurizer. For production of Buck’s Brew, Rhonda uses the base recipe for Gothberg Farms’ gouda and then adds whole brown mustard seeds to the curd.

But when it lands in Brooklyn, it’s washed and cave aged for six to eight weeks, undergoing a total transformation.As it matures, Bufarolo develops a thin natural rind that adds savoriness and umami to the paste’s bright and lemony flavor. The younger the cheese, the bolder the flavor from its rind. Overall, it’s flavor is milky and nutty with a touch of earth, mushrooms, and funk and a little pop of sweetness. Some batches receive special treatment, washed in farmhouse ale from local Transmitter Brewing, for a version that tastes less like earth and more like yeast.Bold Bufarolo needs a drink pairing that tastes just as full—try a smoky stout or a full-bodied red like Syrah. An easy melter, it’s great atop roasted potatoes. Grated onto a radicchio salad, it’ll stand up well against the bitter leaves."
Buffalo Mozzarella (Deca & Otto),Deca & Otto,Colombia,,,,www.decaotto.com,Buffalo,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Fresh,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),," We often daydream about diving into a pillowy ball of buffalo’s milk mozzarella, famed for the way the milk’s high protein and fat content unite to create a luscious, decadent version of the southern Italian classic. Unfortunately, though, the trip across the Atlantic can be taxing for those ultra-fresh beauties. Enter Deca & Otto, a Colombian producer churning out fresh bufala from the milk of that South American country’s many grassfed buffalos—and exporting it north on refrigerated flights to the U.S. Deca & Otto began as a small project for foodie and entrepreneur Juan Manuel Quintero, who started buying milk from farmers in the Northen Colombian plains—a fertile and swampy landscape perfect for water buffalo—and eventually traveled to Italy to purchase cheesemaking equipment. After meeting Alberto Sasson, a business owner already exporting roses to the U.S. in daily refrigerated flights, the two decided to team up to export cheeses, too (along with a fabulous version of buffalo milk Dulce de Leche, a Burrata, and a line of plain and flavored yogurts.) The duo named their company for Deca, their first buffalo, and Otto, a little bird that sits on her and grooms her while she grazes.  At Deca & Otto Farms, buffalos are milked by hand before the milk is immediately sent to a refrigerator. Production of the cheese begins every morning, as milk is slowly agitated to reach the correct temperature and pH, until curds separate from whey. As in traditional mozzarella-making, cheesemakers form curds together, chop them up and re-heat them inwater to render themflexible. Stretched curds areformed into a ball and placed in cool water to solidify. They`ll remain submerged in a brine when packaged,to stay moist and fresh.Exuding aromas of milk, lemon juice and pebbles, this bone-white mozzarella ball looks smooth on the surface and opens to reveal a textured inside. Flavor is buttery and milky, with a slight minerality.The cheese is available in three distinct sizes (small Ciliegine, medium Bocconcini and large Ovoline), offering flexibility for a range of uses in salads or in typical Italian recipes."
Burrata (Belgioioso),BelGioioso Cheese Co.,United States,Wisconsin,Varies according to weight,Varies,www.belgioioso.com,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Fresh,FreshPasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Founded by Errico Auricchio, BelGioioso Cheese is a cheesemaking operation based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Errico comes from a family of cheese makers who have been producing Provolone in Italy for over a century. In 1979, he moved his family to the United States and opened his own Italian cheese company. Over the last thirty years, BelGioioso has grown to include seven manufacturing facilities in Northeastern Wisconsin. Using the milk of Wisconsin dairy farmers, the company produces over 25 types of cheese. However, each facility produces only a select few of these cheeses, thereby ensuring high quality and consistency. This has resulted in multiple awards, including several United States, World and American Cheese Society Awards. BelGoioso’s Burrata is a small round of stretched cheese, which is hand-pulled around fresh curds and heavy cream. It appears very similar to Mozzarella, but don’t be fooled. The clean, lactic smelling cheese can be split open to spill out its curd and cream center. The flavor is similar to its aroma, clean, fresh and lactic. The texture of Burrata is a toothsome outer layer and a rich, delicate interior.A classic serving suggestion is to place it on a salad of tomatoes and basil with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Burrata is best paired with a light white wine such as an Italian Vermentino."

Burrata (Maplebrook Farm),Maplebrook Farm,United States,Vermont,,"2, 4 or 8 oz",www.maplebrookvt.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,None,FreshPasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Maplebrook Farm was founded in 2003 after a chance encounter. Founder, Johann Englert, came across Al Ducci`s Groceria in Manchester, Vermont during a visit and when she tasted their mozzarella, it transported her back to her time in Italy during college. Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lives. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today, Maplebrook Farm is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. It employs around 20 cheesemakers, who are each trained in old world cheesemaking techniques. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Mike still is the head cheesemaker for the majority of their cheeses, but as of 2010 now has help from Domenico Marchitelli, who makes the Burrata and Scamorza. Domenico hails from Puglia, Italy, the birthplace of Burrata. Maplebrook Farm’s Burrata is made using the traditional techniques of a stretched curd cheese, very similar to Mozzarella, pulled into a sheet. The sheet of cheese then has fresh cream and stracciatelli (shreds of Mozzarella curds) placed in the center. The sheet of stretched curd is then wrapped around the filling and pinched off at the top. The result is a ball of cheese that when cut, spills its creamy contents onto the plate.Burrata’s flavor is of fresh milk, with textural layers varying from the snap of the outside skin of stretched cheese to the soft cream interior. This cheese is perfectly paired with fresh tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper. Or it can also be paired nicely with fresh figs sprinkled with a touch of salt.Prosecco is the suggested wine pairing for Maplebrook’s Burrata."
Burrata (Mozzarella Co),Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,3 inch ball,0.5 lbs,www.mozzarellaco.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Paula’s inspirationto makepasta filata cheeses stems from her love of Italian cheese as well as her frustration at not being able to find fresh Mozzarella in Dallas during the 1980’s. Determined to put this right, she spent time at a small cheese factory near Perugia where she learned to make fresh mozzarella. Paula continues to use the pasta filata cheesemaking skills that she learned in Italy in the production of her range of fresh young Italian-style cheeses. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk, which is sourced from Dairy Farmers of America, is pasteurized. Starter cultures are added along with rennet. Once coagulated, the curd is cut both horizontally and vertically by hand with cheese knives, forming small soft cubes and releasing a quantity of excess whey. The curds are allowed to “rest” in the whey until they reach the correct texture. At this point, hot water is poured over them and the curds are stretched and worked with a small paddle until they become malleable, smooth and satin-like in texture. This is the most crucial and skilled part of the cheesemaking process, because there’s only a small window of opportunity to stretch the curd. If the curd is worked before the pH level reaches 5.2, it becomes tough and inferior. However, if the pH falls too low, the curd won’t form into cheese. Assuming all goes well, desired shapes are pinched off from the stretched curd and immediately tossed into cool water to chill down. One chilled, they are briefly placed into a brine solution. In the production of this particular Burrata, the mozzarella is formed around a lump of sweat cream butter.With a subtle, sour-milk smell, this Burrata has a firm yet slightly creamy outer layer, a sticky surface and a tender, buttery paste. On the palate it is incredibly soft and luscious with a light tang and a sweet sourness. The dissolving interior is reminiscent of homemade buttercream frosting, melting in the mouth and coating the tongue.Pair it with a Prosecco or with a Pinot Grigio."

Recently, they have started to export to the United States and Canada. Burwash Rose is a semi-soft cheese that was developed by Cliff and Julie over several years, is inspired by the types of cheeses that were made by monks in British monasteries many centuries ago. It’s made from the raw milk of grass-fed Frisian cows from nearby Lullings Farm. As the cheese ages over eight weeks, the Dyhalls wash its rind in English rosewater. The result is a bright orange and sticky surface with a distinctive floral-scented aroma.Texture is delicate, creamy and silky. Flavor is rich and full with buttery flavors and a build-up of rose floral notes.The Dyhalls suggest serving Burwash Rose with Ouse Valley Chilli Jam and sourdough, also pointing out that it’s fabulous baked in the oven.

Buttermilk Blue,Roth Käse,United States,Wisconsin,"7.5 ins diameter, 4 ins high",6 lbs,www.rothkase.com,Cow,,BlueFirm,Microbial,Natural,Blue,,"The Roth family cheesemaking venture began in 1863 in Uster, Switzerland, then a small town just outside Zurich. By the end of the century a decision was made to bring the family`s knowledge and appreciation of European cheeses to America. By the early 1900`s, Otto Roth, son of the founder, had established a successful business that soon became one of the largest importers of European specialty cheeses in North America and that laid the foundation for what today forms Roth Käse USA. In 1991, convinced there was a future for making great cheeses in America, Fermo Jaeckle, a former executive with Otto Roth & Co., joined with his cousins, Felix and Ulrich Roth, to further extend their European/Swiss roots and cheesemaking expertise into Green County, Wisconsin. Known locally as Little Switzerland for its source of high quality milk, this area in the heart of Wisconsin is particularly well-suited for cheesemaking. It is here that Roth Käse USA was established, initially with a view towards making authentic Gruyère and other Alpine-style cheeses. Agaist this backdrop, Buttermilk Blue is the result of a collaboration between Roth Käse, and a farmers` dairy cooperative in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Prior to 1993, when Roth Käse entered the picture, the farmers were selling their predominantly Jersey cow`s milk to two Danish cheesemakers that ran a business from the co-op`s cheese plant where they made blue cheese. However, the cheesemaking business ran aground and, in search of a new outlet for their milk, the co-op successfully approached Roth Käse to take over the cheese business, continuing the produciton of Blue cheese with the new name of Buttermilk Blue. The interior paste of Buttermilk Blue is ivory-colored with blue-gray veins and pockets that stops short of the edge of the cheese. Aromas are pronounced, with notes of buttermilk and blue mold. Flavors near the rind are fairly salty. The cheese has rich, creamlike flavors towards the center, cut through with a robust milk tang. The tangyness of Buttermilk Blue presents a challenge for most red wines. However, a Sauternes-type dessert wine or a high-alcohol beer such as Chimay Blue could work well."
Buttons,Harley Farms,United States,California,1.5 in diameter x 1 in height,1.5 oz,www.harleyfarms.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,Flavor Added,Fresh,Flavor added to pasteFlavor added to rind,"Located in Pescadero, California, Harley Farms is a restored dairy farm that dates back to 1910. Owned and run by Dee Harley, a native of Britain, this is the only remaining dairy in San Mateo County, a once thriving dairy region. Having originally started with six pet goats, Harley Farms is now home to over 200 American Alpine goats. The milk is transformed into farmstead cheeses daily. In production of this fresh chèvre, milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature in order to retain as much of its character as possible. The curd is also handled very gently to preserve the high moisture and delicate texture of the cheese. The fresh cheese is allowed to drain for two days before being formed into buttons with added flavors. These chèvre buttons come in four flavor combinations: Herbes de Provence, Cranberry Walnut, Apricot Pistachio and Tomato Basil.In each version of this cheese the fluffy, creamy fresh chèvre is well balanced with added flavors. Herbes de Provence adds slightly bitter, savory and earthy flavors and a lemony scent to the fresh cheese. The Cranberry Walnut version, which has walnuts sandwiched in the center of the cheese and a striking red cranberry topping, is sweet and desserty with just the right amount of sour tang. The Apricot Pistachio variety has ground pistachios in the center and a topping of dried apricots; yielding sour and buttery flavors that match perfectly with the cheese’s creaminess. And the Tomato-Basil version, with its sundried tomato topping and line of basil sandwiched inside, is notably earthy and bitter."
Buure Weichchaesli Moser,BonCas Dairy,Switzerland,Dotzigen,"1 inch diameter, 0.5 ins high",2 oz,www.moser-kaese.ch,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Buure Weichchaesli (which translates as “The Farmer`s Soft Cheese”) is made by Ueli Moser at his BonCas dairy in Dotzigen, a small village in the western part of Switzerland known as Lake Land. Moser comes from a cheese maker family. His father produced a variety of Swiss classic hard and semi hard cheeses such as Tilsiter and Emmentaler in the Thurgau region. Upon completion of his cheesemaking apprenticeship, Moser moved to France where he worked - and fell in love - with the French soft ripened cheeses there. After his return to Switzerland, he bought the dairy in Dotzigen and for several years divided his time and labor between his father’s business, where he made classic Swiss cheeses and his new venture where he produced only soft cheeses. Quintessentially, Moser is an excellent cheesemaker who is also a good businessman. His facility is modern, efficient and streamlined and the cheeses he makes are reliably consistent. As such, he has positioned his business to supply larger customers such as grocery store chains as well as smaller independent stores. Moser works exclusively with cow’s milk sourced from larger milk co-operatives. With the exception of his Crublanc which is made from raw milk, all Moser’s products pasteurized.  For production of the Buure Weichchaesli, Moser adds a blend of 2/3 of thermophilic and 1/3 of mesophilic starter cultures, which contribute greatly to the cheese’s character. The surface of the cheese is innoculated with aerobic yeast cultures as well as a geotricum mold. The latter controls the growth of the yeast and keeps the surface from becoming too wet. Once the curd is in the forms, the young cheeses are allowed to drain under their own weight. This expels some of the whey and allows the curd to knit together. During the first 24 hours, the cheeses are turned or flipped three or four times which promotes the even distribution and drainage of moisture and then placed in a brine bath for 20 minutes. The next stage is the aging room. There, the cheeses are kept for between eight and ten days at a humidity of between 85-95% and a temperature of between 58-60°F - lower humidity and higher temperature in the beginning, higher humidity and lower temperature towards the end. Flavors and the texture of the Buure Weichchaesli are directly influenced by the cultures used in combination with the small size of the cheese. Due to the small volume to surface area ratio, the cheese cools down quickly when placed in refrigeration. This means the mesophilic cultures (ones that work best at low temperatures) are more active than the thermophilic (high temperature) cultures while the cheese matures.  The net result of this is that the Buure Weichchaesli is a relatively firm cheese and yet it has an extremely creamy texture with big, aromatic notes. Flavors are very clean, bright and lactic and yet balanced by deep rich hints of mushrooms and earth.Ideal pairings for this cheese include Champagne or a dry, sparkling white wine or a Sauvignon Blanc."

The creamery is located at the Volpi Ranch near Petaluma, just north of San Francisco, California, which is also the source for Scanlan`s goat`s milk. Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three. Andante`s Cabécou is similar to the famous French Cabécou. Made from pasteurized goat`s milk and about the size of a silver dollar, these tiny cheeses are absolutely decadent.Being so small, Cabécou reaches its maturation peak very quickly. The interior paste is straw-white in color, soft and oozy in texture. The rind is fragile, delicate and completely edible. Cabécou’s flavor is rich with notes of toasted nuts, hay and flowers."
Cabécou de Rocamadour,Various,France,Perigord,"2 ins diameter,  0.5in high",1-2 oz,,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Derived from the old southern French word for `small goat`, the name `Cabécou` has become synonymous (at least in cheese terms) with Cabécou de Rocamadour - a very small disc of cheese traditionally made from raw goat`s milk but now also available in a pasteurized version. Each year some 500 tons are produced in the triangle between Rocamadour, Gramat, and Carlucet. Cabécou must always be made with raw milk, using small amounts of rennet. Cheeses must also be allowed to coagulate slowly for at least 20 hours (compared with the usual 30-60 minutes for many natural rind cheeses). Rocamadour`s delicate flavor comes from the richness of the goat`s milk, a result of the goats having access to the pastures in the Rocamadour area where hawthorn, juniper and mulberry trees proliferate. These cheeses are at their best in the spring made with the new season`s milk. Due to their small size, Cabécou de Rocamadour mature rapidly. They can be happily eaten at about 2 weeks of age, when the rind is thin and the interior paste is tender, supple and yielding with flavors of milk and hazelnuts. At four weeks or more, the cheeses become firm and the pale rind develops spots of blue mold. Flavors become stronger and more assertively goaty with notes of caramel. The cheeses develop a stronger, nuttier flavour whilst becoming drier."
Cabrales,Various,Spain,Asturias,"7-8 in. diameter, 4-5 in. high",6 lbs,,Cow,Raw,FirmBlue,Animal,Leaf WrappedNatural,Blue,,"Cabrales has a well-deserved reputation for being among the most distinctive and powerful blue cheeses. Traditionally, wheels are wrapped in leaves, though most that find their way to the United States have natural rinds and are foil-wrapped. Either way, when fully ripe, Cabrales has an incredibly strong blue flavor.Cabrales is produced by small-scale, traditional dairies in the twenty or so villages in the Cabrales and Penamellera Alta districts of eastern Asturias in northern Spain.The milk used for production is sourced from livestock that live in mountainous areas where, during the summer months, they can take advantage of the abundant summer pastures at high altitude. Although Cabrales was traditionally made with a mix of raw cow`s, sheep’s, and goat`s milk, today`s versions are more commonly made from just raw cow`s milk.The cheeses are aged from two to six months in maturing rooms located in the region’s limestone mountains. The relative humidity is typically around 90%, while the temperature is a cool 45°-55°F. These conditions favor the growth of thePenicillium Roqueforti molds that are instrumental in developing dense, blue-green veins throughout the paste.When ripe, Cabrales has a smooth texture, punctuated with holes and pockets of blue. The creamy paste is studded with crunchy granules of crystallized amino acids.Not for the faint of heart, Cabrales is often wild and spicy in flavor and aroma, with distinct notes of salt that become more intense as the cheese ages. In mixed milk versions, these flavors can also be quite acidic and more complex.Cabrales is best paired with something sweet, like honey or fig jam, to mellow its intensity."

Inititally, they only produced milk, but in 1990, the dairy began making cheeses using milk provided by the members. The cooperative’s aims are two-fold. The first is to raise their animals in a humane manner and to operate their farms in an environmentally sound way. Second, La Fermière de Méan aims to provide consumers with healthy and environmentally conscious dairy products that are high in quality. Modeled on a cow’s milk cheese made by the same producer, Cabricharme is a Trappist style raw goat’s milk cheese. The milk used in this cheese is from a single farm-member of the cooperative. Over the course of 6 weeks, the cheese is washed in a brine solution that gives Cabricharme’s salmon-pink rind its color and helps the ivory white interior develop its flavor and supple texture. The flavor of the semi-soft paste is tangy and savory to the point of meatiness. Its rind is edible and has a crunchy texture and salty flavor. Cabricharme is a very aromatic cheese, with yeast and mushrooms present and dry-aged beef as well.With its meaty flavors and rich texture, beer is the beverage to pair with this cheese. Especially, Belgian Blonde Ales such as Chimay Cinq Cent. A good hard cider can also work well with this cheese. For wine, choose a dry unoaked white wine. Cabricharme can melt beautifully in pasta dishes or sandwiches. It is wonderful to eat on its own with apple slices or with roasted squash."
Cabrie,Montchevré,United States,Wisconsin,Varies according to weight,2.2 lbs or 4.4 oz,www.montchevre.com,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,,,"Located in Belmont, Wisconsin, Montchevré produces a wide range of goat’s milk cheeses. The running of the company is overseen by Arnaud Solandt and Jean Rossard, both of whom have a strong background in the dairying and cheesemaking business. Solandt grew up in France in the town of Montauban, where his grandmother owned a creamery. His father worked for Tempé-Lait before starting his own business representing French cheese manufacturers to various export markets including the USA. It was the dominance of the cheese market in the US that persuaded Solandt’s father to move his family out to the United States in 1983. Having effectively grown up surrounded by the cheese business, it was no surprise when three years later Arnaud was approached by Michel Betin, one of the principle French Manufacturers to asked him to help with his company that was undergoing a difficult transition. Arnaud accepted and moreover, was the driving force behind shifting the company’s focus from importing French cheeses to developing a cheesemaking business that specialized in French style cheeses. Montchevré’s Head Cheesemaker is Jean Rossard also grew up in France surrounded by a world of cheese. Jean’s father was a cheese maker and his babysitter was the truck driver who collected the milk for his father – often with Jean in the seat beside him. Today, cheesemaking at Montchevré takes place within a large 110,000 sq. ft building and the company produces over 250,000 pounds of goat cheese each week. The first cheeses they made were the Cabrie, the Chevriotte and the Chevre in Blue. Milk is sourced from mixed breed goats located at over 300 farms across Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri. Styled after brie but made with goat’s milk, Cabrie is a white, bloomy-rinded cheese, resulting from the addition of penicilium candidum cultures during the cheesemaking process.Flavors and aromas are mildly tangy when young, becoming increasingly assertive with age as the cheese matures from the outside towards the center. Likewise, young cheeses have a firm texture throughout that begins to break down near the rind, becoming softer and creamier with age.Cabrie works well on a cheese board, alongside some fresh fruit, melted on your favorite burger or simply paired with some fresh bread and crackers. It pairs well with Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio or Champagne."
Cacio Pecora,Fruition Farms Dairy,United States,Colorado,8-10 in diameter x 5 in height,6 lbs,http://www.fruitionfarmsdairy.com,Sheep,Raw,Firm,AnimalMicrobial,Natural,,,"Alex Seidel purchased a ten-acre farm just south of Denver in Larkspur, Colorado in May of 2009. Partnering with Josh Halder from Verde Farms and former Fruition Restaurant sous chef Jimmy Warren, Siedel’s idea was to create a learning center and a sustainable relationship between farm and restaurant, spreading awareness among community members and local restaurants of the fundamentals of farming produce, animal husbandry and the creation of artisanal products. After attending the Dairy Sheep Association of North America’s annual symposium in the Hudson Valley, the trio was inspired to create Colorado’s first artisanal sheep dairy and creamery. Less than a year later, in September of 2010, they welcomed a flock of 40 milking ewes and one ram. Cheesemaking began three days later. Today Fruition Farms sells lamb and sheep’s wool in addition to three farmstead cheeses, which are produced using whole sheep’s milk from twice-daily milkings. Inspired by a combination of cheesemaking traditions from both Italy and Spain, in its early days, Cacio Pecora was produced in a ten-quart stockpot and aged in a wine cooler cave. Today it has upgraded to a 100-gallon make tank and 600 sq. feet of temperature and humidity-controlled caves. A recipe that took 18 months of trial and error to perfect, this semi-firm cheese develops its unique flavor and texture due to the use of raw sheep’s milk and the addition of mesophilic and thermophilic cultures. Pressed into six-pound molds and brined for two days, wheels are then aged for a minimum of six months.Texture of Cacio Pecora is firm, while flavor is nutty, floral and grassy.Fruition Farms’ cheesemakers suggest incorporating this cheese into risotto or potatoes, or shaving it onto a salad."
Caciocavallo Pezzata Rossa,Claudio Di Domenico,Italy,Abruzzo,"5.5 ins diameter, 6 ins long",2.5 lbs,www.marcelliformaggi.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Caciocavallo Pezzata Rossa is made by Claudio Di Domenico from the raw milk of the rare breed “Red Cow”. Claudio is the nephew of famed Abruzzo cheesemaker Gregorio Rotolo, and the family has been making cheese since the 1970’s. The Red Cow is a heritage breed, perhaps best known for its high protein and butterfat milk, albeit given in very small quantities. Although it was originally used in the production of Parmigiano Reggiano, by the 1980’s this breed was virtually extinct. Claudio, togther with a handful of other local cheesemakers, have consciously committed to using - and thus preserving - these ancient breeds of dairy cattle. Cheesemaking takes place at the family farm called La Grancia di Sant Angelo, which is located in the mountains of Abruzzo. A few producers still practice the ancient tradition of transhumance, whereby their animals are transported on a summer migration to higher mountain slopes to access fresh pasture. However, La Grancia di Sant Angelo comprises a vast amount of acreage that allows the animals - and therefore the cheesemaking - to remain in one place. For production, the milk is first filtered and poured into a wooden tub which, due to its porous nature, acts as a natural starter culture. In addition, the cultures are given a boost by adding a small quantity of the previous day’s whey or curd to encourage acidification. The milk is heated to between 96.8-100.4º F (36-38ºC) and rennet added to coagulate the milk. After approximately thirty minutes, the curds are cut by hand and some of the whey is drained off. The curds are then allowed to “rest” in the remaining whey for two hours before being transferred to another vat containing water at 176ºF (80ºC).

Caciocavallo Pezzata Rossa is a ""pasta filata"" style of cheese, meaning that the curd is stretched.

Caciocavallo Podolico,Various,Italy,Campania,"10 ins length, 6 ins diameter",4-5 lbs,,Cow,,Hard,Animal,Natural,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Produced in Irpinia in the Campania Region of southern Italy, Caciocavallo Podolico is made from the raw milk of a rare breed of Italian cow: the Podolica. The Podolica`s ability to adapt to the harsh conditions of this inland area has aided its survival through the centuries. Between November and June, the herds are based on the lower pastures of Puglia. In June, accompanied by shepherds, they move up the mountains to an altitude of about 3,600 feet. There they feed on upland grasses and mountain plants such as nettles, blueberries, rosehips, hawthorn, cornelian cherries, juniper, and wild strawberries. These flavors can be tasted in the cheese. During these months the shepherds transform themselves into cheesemakers, producing Caciocavallo Podolico (a pasta filata style of cheese, meaning that the curd is stretched, in this case into a ball shape). The unusual elongated shape of Caciocavallo Podolico is a result of the young cheeses being tied with rope to make a ""neck"" and then suspended over a wooden rod to mature. Cheeses are aged for about three months in the herders` mountain huts. The summer season ends in November, at which time the shepherds bring their cows and cheeses down to lower slopes for the winter. Caciocavallo literally means ""horse cheese,"" and although the meaning of the name has been debated for centuries, it`s probably derived from the traditional method of transport; the cheeses would be suspended like saddlebags across a horse`s flank for the journey down the mountain.Caciocavallo Podolico has a smooth rind that thickens as the cheese matures for up to one year, at which point flavors are complex and intense, with savory vegetal notes of smoke, herbs, toast and barnyard that are balanced by an intense fruitiness and lactic tang. The texture is hard and quite dry with occasional holes.A good wine pairing would be a well structured red from southern Italy with a mineraly quality."
Caciocavallo Podolico Colantuano,Carmelina Colantuono,Italy,Abruzzo,"5.5-6 ins diameter, 8.5 ins long",3.5 lbs,www.marcelliformaggi.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Carmelina Colantuono is something of an Italian legend. Not only is she one of only a tiny handful of women cheesemakers in the country, but she is also the fourth generation cheesemaker in her family. Based in Frosolone during the winter months, Carmelia is also affectionately referred to as “the Last Cow Girl” - a nod to the fact she continues to practice the ancient tradition of transhumance. This involves shepherding her herd of 240 Podolico cows on a 250 km journey at the beginning of summer and back again in the autumn between Frosolone and Abruzzo in order to access fresh summer pasture. The journey takes three days traversing difficult terrain and a considerable difference of altitude ranging from 180 meters (590 ft) to 1300 meters (4265 ft). However, according to Carmelina, some of the greatest challenges lie in the interface of traditional transhumace with modern day life. Coordinating the cows’ route with the various local police and other authorities to ensure traffic management and safety is time consuming and at times, nerve-wracking. The Podolico are a particularly hardy breed of cow with a strong ability to adapt to harsh, mountainous conditions where other breeds would not survive. This trait, together with their capacity to produce high quality milk, has been the main reason for their survival down the centuries. For production of Caciocavallo Podolico Colantuano, the milk is first filtered and poured into a wooden tub which, due to its porous nature, acts as a natural starter culture. In addition, the cultures are given a boost by adding a small quantity of the previous day’s whey or curd to encourage acidification. The milk is heated to between 96.8-100.4º F (36-38ºC) and rennet added to coagulate the milk. After approximately thirty minutes, the curds are cut by hand and some of the whey is drained off. The curds are then allowed to “rest” in the remaining whey for two hours before being transferred to another vat containing water at 176ºF (80ºC). There, the curds soften, allowing them to be pulled and stretched by hand into the desired shape before being dunked into cold water to harden. Caciocavallo Podolico Colantuano is a ""pasta filata"" style of cheese, meaning that the curd is stretched. The unusual gourd type shape of the Caciocavallo is a result of the young cheeses being tied with rope to make a ""neck"" and then suspended over a wooden rod to mature. The texture is firm and dense and similar to chocolate in that it flakes slightly when cut. It is also possible to see the striations where curd has been pulled.Flavors are rich and smooth and deeply complex with notes of caramel, milk and herbs and very long finish."
Caciocavallo Silano,Casa Madaio,Italy,Calabria,Various,2.2 - 4.4 lbs,www.casamadaio.it/en.html,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Owned by the Madaio family, Casa Madaio is an acclaimed cheese affineur (maturer) and producer located in Salerno, Italy. The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Caciocavallo is an ancient cheese that is produced throughout southern Italy and the Balkans and is typically made with cow or sheep’s milk. We know of its existence in the ancient world through the works of Hippocrates, who mentioned the cheese in the 5th Century, BCE. The name, Caciocavallo literally means, “cheese on horseback,” referring to the way two cheeses are tied at the ends of a long rope and then hung over a rod to age. This makes the cheese look like a saddlebag thrown over the back of a horse. Cacicavallo Silano is only made in the Calabria region of Italy and is made strictly with cow’s milk. Since 1993, Cacicavallo Silano has held DOP status in Italy and recently obtained the European Union’s DOP status. To produce one 2.2 lb balloon-shaped cheese, 22 lbs of cow’s milk is used. It is a pasta filata cheese, which means that the curd is kneaded and stretched when it is still warm. This produces a dense, elastic texture that allows the cheese to be made into spherical shapes. Caciocavallo Silano is aged for 2 to 6 months before being released. The flavor of this cheese changes as it matures. As the Italians say, it is like a man, when young it is sweet, when mature it is spicy. When pairing wine with Caciocavallo Silano, it depends on whether the cheese is young or more mature. For the younger version, light white wines such as Chardonnay or Falanghina (a southern Italian white wine) or full-bodied red wines such as Aglianico del Vulture are recommended. When more mature, pair it with a bold red such as Chianti or Nebbiolo. Caciocavallo Silano can be used in a wide range of recipes, from grilling the cheese to top salads or potatoes, to using it in Risotto.

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as some aged cheeses—including these semi-firm wheels of Caciotta. Produced with pasteurized cow’s milk sourced from Dairy Farmers of America, Caciotta is a Texas version of Monterey jack. Wheels are waxed and aged for two months. In addition to this plain version, flavor variations include Ancho Chile, La Cocina, Texas Basil, Mexican Marigold Mint, and Black Pepper and Garlic. A goat’s milk version is also produced.Caciotta is Downy-soft and pliable, like a cloud, with an almost sticky surface. Scent is lactic and a bit sour while taste is much more mild, with an initial tanginess that quickly dissipates, only a whisper of flavor remaining.Mozzarella Company’s cheesemakers recommend pairing Caciotta with a Sauvignon Blanc or with a medium-bodied Merlot."
Caerphilly (Gorwydd Farm),Gorwydd Farm,United Kingdom,Ceredigion,"9 ins diameter,   3-4 ins high",9 lb,www.gorwydd.com,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,Cheddar-like,,"Located in Wales, Gorwydd Caerphilly (pronounced ""gor-with"") was launched in 1996 by Todd Trethowan. Before setting up his business, Trethowan worked with several leading British cheesemakers over a 10-year period, in particular Chris Duckett who, for many years, was the only farmhouse Caerphilly producer in Britain. Cheesemaking at Gorwydd is overseen husband-and-wife team Maugan and Kim Trethowan. Maugan is Todd`s brother and business partner and Kim, a native of New Zealand, is responsible for maturing the cheese. Cheeses are produced by hand with barely any mechanisation. Named after the town in South Wales where it originated, Caerphilly is a traditional Welsh cheese that first appeared at the beginning of the 19th century. It was initially produced by local farmers for domestic consumption and to utilize surplus milk. However, by the 1830s it began to be sold for additional income as demand for Caerphilly grew. It became very popular with Welsh miners partly due to its size and thick rind, making it easy to eat with dirty hands in the coal pits. Miners considered it solid nourishment, and believed it could neutralize some of the toxic substances inhaled at the coal face. Caerphilly was so popular that it spread to the cheddar farms in Somerset, England. There, farmers would use the cheese to help their cash flow, as the nine-pound Caerphilly wheels matured much faster than their fifty-pound cheddars. However, by 1910 farmstead Caerphilly was in decline. Mechanization of cheese production meant that farmers could no longer compete against cheaper cheeses being imported from England and abroad, and most found it easier to sell their milk to other processors. It`s thanks to just a few persistent makers like Chris Duckett—and now, the Threthowans—that the Caerphilly tradition lives on.Three distinct textures and flavors run through Gorwydd Caerphilly. The rind of the cheese is covered in grey-brown molds, can be quite dense, and has distinctly earthy flavors. Just under the rind, there is a layer (that should never extend more than about one inch into the cheese), which is quite mushroomy. Finally, the center of the cheese is slightly chalky and open with hints of milk and citrus.Pair this Caerphilly with a chardonnay or a chenin blanc."
Caerphilly (Tonjes),Tonjes Farm Dairy,United States,New York,"9 ins diameter, 4 ins high",8lbs,None,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,Cheddar-like,,"In the early 2000s, like many dairy farmers over the last few decades, Tim Tonjes was having a hard time keeping his family dairy with production costs rising and market prices falling. Despite pressure to increase the size of the dairy in order to compete, Tim didn’t want to increase the size of his farm, or herd of Holstein-Friesian cows, which are all allowed to roam in pastures and feed on grass. It was thanks to a local cooperative program that teaches local dairy farmers how to add value to their dairy products, that Tim became interested in cheesemaking. He learned the craft using New York State’s CheeseMobile, a cheese plant on wheels, which was parked on his farm for two years while he honed his skills and saved up for his own facility. In 2003, Tonjes Farm Dairy began making cheese, starting with Mozzarella. Once Tim was able to make the investment, he dug out a hillside on the property to build a cheesemaking room and aging cave. Having the facility built into the hill ensures that energy costs are kept to a minimum, plus it’s a nod to the cheesemaking tradition of aging cheese in caves. Tim still considers himself a farmer first; after all you need to grow hay to feed the cows. However, he does much more now. With the help of his wife Mary and other family members Tim is the cheesemaker, packager, distributor and marketer for his own products. Aged for around 90 days, Tonjes’ Caerphilly is his version of the renowned Welsh cheese of the same name and it is one of a number of raw cow’s milk cheeses that are produced on the farm.Tonjes Caerphilly has a brown rind with white molds encasing a crumbly, light yellow paste. The flavor is sharp with a balanced amount of salt.When paired with beer, this cheese really sings. It was traditionally used as Welsh Glamorgan Sausage, essentially a fried stick of cheese. Caerphilly can also be enjoyed with brown bread and green apples in keeping with its humble beginnings as lunch for Welsh coal miners."

Rynn started down the path of a high powered corporate career with a side passion for food, but that all changed when she met David, an Italian-American from New Jersey with a natural talent for cooking. After an eventful trip to Italy, the couple decided to quit their jobs and travel and study food in Italy. Upon their return, David began working as a chef and the couple decided to open their own dairy with Rynn at the helm. The Caputo Brother’s Creamery opened its doors in 2011 after a final trip to Italy to ensure that their cheese-making technique was fine-tuned. Rynn and David source the milk from a local creamery and focus on fresh and stretched cheeses.  Cagliata is simply a fresh curd cheese that was designed by Rynn and David for home cooks to make their own pasta filata (stretched curd) cheeses such as Mozzarella and Burrata. These cheeses are made soaking the Cagliata in hot water, followed by a melding and stretching process. The curds that make up Cagliata are formed using rennet and enzymes and are cut by hand. No salt is added during production. This leaves a very straightforward curd that the consumer can use in a variety of ways and can also experiment with. It may be the only cultured curd on the market. Since Cagliata is not a ready to eat cheese, no pairing suggestions are provided here."
Cahills Irish Whiskey Cheese,Cahill's Farm Cheese,Ireland,Co Limerick,"8 ins diameter, 3 ins high",4oz,www.cahillscheese.ie,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Waxed,,Flavor added to paste,"Cahill’s farmhouse cheese is a third generation, family-owned, small scale cheesemaking business located near Newcastlewest in County Limerick in southern Ireland. Ths history of the business begins with David Cahill in 1902 when he bought a working dairy farm on the banks of the river Deel. Initially, the dairy farm supplied fresh milk to the nearby Newcastlewest Creamery. However, after a series of setbacks, David changed direction, instead selling milk door to door which proved to be more lucrative. In order to better serve this business, in 1910 he constructed a small dairy. The dairy passed to David’s nephew, William Cahill in 1920 who, together with his family, continued to grow and develop the business, starting to produce soft cheeses during the 1950’s. Today, the business focuses more on small-scale, hand-crafted flavored cheeses, including Cahill’s Irish Whiskey Cheese which the company first started to make in 1991. Cow’s milk is sourced from local dairy farms and pasteurized for production. The whiskey used is Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey and comes from the Cooley distillery in Co. Louth. The whiskey is added to the curd after it has been formed and the whey drained off, which is what gives the paste of the cheese its gently mottled, golden hue against the curd. Wheels are matured for a minimum of nine months and are graded before release. They have a waxed rind which helps to seal in the moisture. The interior paste clearly shows the delineation between curd and whiskey and yet has a smooth, dense texture. Flavors are smooth and rich. The taste of whiskey is distinct without overwhelming the milky flavors of the cheese."

Calderwood,Jasper Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,,,jasperhillfarm.com,Cow,Raw,,Animal,NaturalFlavor Added,Alpine-style,Flavor added to rind,"Soon after its release, Calderwood made its name as the new kid on the block with a second place Best of Show at the American Cheese Society Judging & Competition in 2018. The most recent creation of Jasper Hill Farm, this Alpine-style cheese is coated with hay, which lends it a multifaceted flavor profile ranging from honey to pineapple.   Located in the beautiful rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont, Jasper Hill Farm was launched by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler in 1998. After five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. Thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they now have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall, and over successive years, the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses, and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. The brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill, which comprise 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves, were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of other Vermont producers.   More recently, the Kehlers teamed up with German company AgriCompact Technologies to produce a hay drying facility: The Randi Albert Calderwood Cropping Center is the first of its kind in the United States. The brothers were inspired by their observation of a hay dryer in action in Parma Italy, a region whose cheese calls for grass-fed milk, but whose climate is a bit too rainy for making consistent dry hay. Once they brought that technology stateside, they were able to apply the complexity of hay to their newest cheese: Calderwood.  The idea for this unique cheese came from attempting to press toasted and shredded hay (the same hay that the cattle eat) into the rind of Alpha Tolman, a cheese that Jasper Hill has been producing for years. Calderwood wheels are washed with brine for six months in the cellars before being coated in hay and sealed in cryovac. After an additional four months of aging, the cryovac is removed and the cheeses are left to dry and form a natural rind in the cellars.The interior of the cheese is firm, nutty and complex, with hints of earth, caramel, chestnut honey, and tropical fruit, especially pineapple.With such a multifaceted flavor profile, Calderwood should serve as a focal point on your cheese plate. Pair it with onion jam, mostarda, or salami. Since itmelts extremely well, you could also try it in an unconventional grilled cheese.  Photo by Kristine Jannuzzi"

Calvander,Chapel Hill Creamery,United States,North Carolina,"3.5” tall, 10” diameter",10 lbs,www.chapelhillcreamery.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Eponymously named Chapel Hill Creamery is located near Chapel Hill in North Carolina and is home to Portia McKnight and Flo Hawley together with their small herd of Jersey cows. Hawley and McKnight had each enjoyed long careers at Whole Foods Market and decided they wanted to get closer to the source of the food that they had sold. In the process of searching for a good milk source in order to begin making cheese, they found that they were unable to get the quality that they wanted. So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced. Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012. Calvander is a Jersey cow’s milk cheese inspired by Asiago that was named after a crossroads that is well known in the Chapel Hill area. It is the condensed name of a 19th century schoolteacher who built a school at the intersection. Calvander, the cheese, is aged for 7 months. During its sleep in the aging facility, it develops a natural rind with a leathery texture. This rind covers an assertive, flakey paste with balanced flavors of butter, herbs and walnuts with a piquant tang. As it ages, it becomes increasingly spicy and firm.This is a cheese that really pairs well with bolder red wines such as a Chianti Superiore or reds with a touch of earthiness such as Merlot. It is a great cheese to grate over pasta or flake off pieces to enjoy with fresh melon."

At about six to eight weeks of age, the texture softens, becoming yielding and unctuous.Camellia pairs well with Hard Cider, dry Rose, Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Noir wines."
Camembert (Le Chatelain),Le Chatelain,France,Normandy,"4.5 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",8oz,,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Marie Harel is credited with the original production of Camembert in Normandy, northern France, in 1791. However, today only a very small number of producers still make a raw milk Camembert according to the same methods that Harel would have used. Those that do, under AOC (name protected) rules can legally call their cheese Camembert Normandie. However, production of Camembert now extends well beyond AOC designation and there are very good Camembert made in Normandie from pasteurized milk, of which Le Châtelain is one. Le Châtelain is made to a recipe similar to the one designated uder AOC guidelines, except that the milk is pasteurized. Curds are ladled carefully into the molds in order to preserve as much moisture as possible and left to drain naturally under their own weight. After several hours they are firm enough to be unmolded and moved to a drying room. Here, they are turned every 48 hours to ensure the even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese and a slight drying of the surface. This encourages growth of the Penicillium Candidum mold and the formation of the white, bloomy rind. Cheeses are then transferred to a maturing room for futher aging. The texture of Camembert should be supple, yielding and consistent throughout - with no chalky stripe in the middle. The color of the interior paste is a deep, golden yellow. Flavors are buttery and rich with hints of mushrooms or truffles and cellar. Good pairings include Chenin Blanc, a light red wine such as Beaujolais or, classically, a glass of Normandy cider."
Camembert de Normandie,Various,France,Normandy,"4.5 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",8 oz,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Although much imitated everywhere, production of Camembert originated in Normandy, France, invented in 1791 by Marie Harel. The name ""Camembert de Normandie"" is protected under AOC rules that were grantd in 1983, meaning that cheeses bearing this name have to be made according to specific guidelines. Regions for production are Calvados, Eure, Manche, Orne and Seine-Maritime, all areas that are dominated by excellent grazing pasture and a mild maritime climate. Milk for production is sourced only from local herds of Normandie cows. Production of Camembert de Normandie, which is made from raw milk, involves the very careful handling of the curd in order to preserve as much moisture as possible. If the curd is overly agitated, it quickly drains of whey thereby ruining the texture of what should be a soft and yielding cheese. Four or five scoops of curd are ladled into the molds and then allowed to drain under their own weight. After several hours they are firm enough to be turned out of their molds and moved to a drying room. Here, they are turned every 48 hours to ensure the even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese and a slight drying of the surface. This encourages growth of the Penicillium candidum mold and the formation of the white bloomy rind. Cheeses are then transferred to a maturing room or, as is often the case, sold to an affineur for further maturation and finishing. When ripe, Camembert de Normandie are covered with a white, bloomy mold that frequently has slightly reddish stripes and patches. Aromas are of mushrooms and clean cellar. The texture of the cheese should be supple, yielding, and consistent throughout. The color of the interior paste is a deep, golden yellow. Flavors of genuine Camembert de Normandie are buttery and rich with hints of mushrooms or truffles and cellar. Good pairings include Chenin Blanc, a light red wine such as Beaujolais, or classically a glass of Normandy cider."

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt, who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” Silvery Moon Creamery’s Camembert is a bloomy rinded cheese inspired by its namesake French classic. To produce this cheese, the milk is first gently batch pasteurized – at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer – in an effort to preserve the integrity of Smiling Hill Farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. Milk is then cultured and renneted, and the curd is cut with a vertical harp before it’s hand-ladled into molds. After draining and salting, discs are aged in the farm’s cheese cave for six weeks, and flipped periodically to ensure the even distribution of moisture and the white fuzzy rind.With a thick snowy white wind and a bulging, slightly chalky paste, this Camembert yields scents of butter and clover on the nose. Flavor is lush and strong, with an initial acidic tang that quickly mellows into a lingering earthy funkiness.On a cheeseplate, serve this Camembert alongside apples, pears or honey. For wine pairings, try it with a Gruener Veltliner or a Reisling."

After many years working at Quesos Corcuera, Eusebio passed the business over to his two brothers, Ramon and Carlos who ran the business until a few years ago. Quesos Corcuera was then passed to their sister, Carmen, who is the current owner and operator. Campo de Montalban is a mixed-milk cheese, containing roughly sixty percent cow`s milk with the remainder comprised of goat`s and sheep`smilks. It was originally considered a Manchego, but in 1985 the AOC standards for Manchego were changed to mandate 100 percent sheep’s milk. As Campo de Montalban is mixed-milk, its name was changed to reflect its home region. Made in the town of La Puebla de Montalban, its name translates to ""the fields of Montalban.""While it still resembles a Manchego, with a striated rind that is painted dark brown, the flavor of Campo del Montalban is all its own. Milk for Campo de Montalban comes primarily from Toledo and cheeses have a mild buttery flavor with notes of nuts and balanced acidity. Aged for 3 months, the texture is firm, but moist and supple.Pair this cheese with a medium bodied red wine. It tastes best when served with foods with a bit of acidity such as roasted tomatoes or sweet accompaniments like membrillo or other fruit pastes."
Campos Góticos,SAT Hermanos Paramio,Spain,Palencia,8 in diameter x 6 in height,6 lbs,www.camposgoticos.com,Sheep,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Campos Góticos is a farmstead sheep’s milk cheese produced in the Villerias de Campos area in the province of Palencia, Spain. Owner Mariano Paramio Antolin has been producing cheese here since 1993, when he decided to create a value-added product using his milk from the local Churra breed of sheep. Only one year after production began, Campos Góticos had already won an award for the best sheep’s milk cheese in Europe. Mariano has played an instrumental role in preserving this native species of sheep, which produces 8-10 times less milk than a foreign diary breed. Despite the low yield, the milk is of extremely high organoleptic quality. With his 1400 sheep and some milk purchased from a neighbor, Mariano produces 90,000 kilos of this hard, pressed cheese each year. In producing Campos Góticos, milk is channelled from the milking room into the cheesemaking room within 10 minutes. After coagulating the raw milk at 96 degrees, the curd is broken down into rice-sized grains. Whey is drained off and used to supplement the feed of farm stock, while the curd is filled into cheesecloth-lined-molds and pressed. Wheels are moved into a cold room for 1-2 days and brined in a 1% salt solution before being placed in an aging room where they’re turned every 2-3 days. In this room, wheels develop a natural mold that’s rubbed to release spores into the air, which in turn spread to the fresher cheeses. After 60-70 days the wheels are washed and brushed with water and moved to another aging room where they’re washed occasionally to control mold growth until release.Campos Góticos is sold in three versions: semi-cured (aged three months), cured (aged 7-8 months), and añejo (aged one year). Flavor transforms over time from sheepy and pungent when young to nuttier and more buttery, with notes of caramel. Paste becomes less oily and more crumbly, exhibiting small holes. Rind is orange-brown, with a basket pattern like that found on a Manchego.Pair it with a glass of fino sherry or with a Rioja."

The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Canestrato is a sheep’s milk cheese that has traditionally been produced on small farms in the Basilicata region of southern Italy. However, today the production area for Casa Madeo’s Canestrato is being moved to the mountains near Catelcivita to ensure that the milk and final cheese is of the highest quality. Canestrato’s rind is brown and covered in striations caused by its aging in wicker baskets while the rind is developing. Once the rind is semi-hard, the cheeses are removed from the baskets and placed on wooden shelves to continue aging for another 7 months. Aged between 12 and 18 months in total, the aromatic character of the cheese changes depending on age. At 12 months, aromas are of milk and grass while at 18 months roasted hazelnuts and hay are prominent. The paste is light yellow with a dense, crumbly texture. Canestrato has a slightly sharp, savage flavor. This is due to its aging in the baskets, which prevents the liquid part of the cheese from dissipating too quickly. It ensures that the final cheese retains the original flavor of the milk.Canestrato has a slightly sharp, savage flavor. This is due to its aging in the baskets, which prevents the liquid part of the cheese from dissipating too quickly.

It is also suggested that it be paired with Passito, an Italian white wine made from dried grapes, which concentrates the flavor. The result is a very sweet wine that has a density reminiscent of a Sauternes. This cheese is very popular served with bean soup in Italy. In fact, some chefs will actually dig out the paste of the cheese and use the rind as a serving bowl for soups."
Cantal,Various,France,Auvergne,"14-17 ins diameter, 14-16 ins high",75-100 lbs,,Cow,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,Animal,Natural,,," This tall cylindrical beauty hails from the Aubrac plateau of south-central France, a high-elevation grazing area blooming with rough pasture that`s never cut. There, amidst the volcanic landscape of the Auvergne, Laguiole and Salers breed cows graze outside during hot, stormy summers before descending back to home farms during cold, snowy winters, as they have for millennia. Locals say that Cantal cheese is equally ancient, with references to the style dating back thousands of years. In 1980 that long history was acknowledged as hundreds of the cheese`s producers banded together to protect its name and traditional recipe with a Protected Designation of Origin. Today ""Fermier"" versions ofCantal are still made on small farms and at high altitudes during summer months, while village diaries and commercial plants also produce wheels year round. For traditional production of Cantal, rennet is added and to the milk, and it`s heated to 90ºF with coagulation taking place approximately one hour later. The curd is then cut and the whey removed before being wrapped in a cloth (it is still a large slab at this point, known as a tome) and pressed multiple times to expel more whey. After pressing, the tome is allowed to rest for eight hours at between 54-59ºF before being passed through a curd mill that breaks the curd into small pieces. Salt is added and mixed in and then it is left overnight before being transferred into cloth-lined molds for pressing. After unmolding, cheeses are moved to aging caves and matured for a minimum of 30 days, but more usually between two and six months, at a temperature of 50ºF and humidity of 90 percent. Finished cheeses have an aluminum plaque applied to the rind that denotes the department (regional) and laiterie (creamery) numbers, the day of its production, and a code that denotes the size of the wheel: CA for the 35-40kg cheese, CP for the 20-22 kg Petit Cantal and CT for the 8-10 kg Cantalet. Cantal is sold at three ages: young (up to 3 months), regular (3-6 months), and aged (over 6 months).The texture of Cantal is semi-firm, moist and slightly crumbly with a natural rind mottled with brown, grey and rust colored molds. In terms of flavor, Cantal is not particularly pronounced or assertive, but it develops wonderfully complex and blended subtle notes of butter and milk, citrus, caramel and nuts with a very long and pleasant finish.Good red wine pairings include beaujolais cru and cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir or merlot from California. For whites, try a white Bordeaux, although Cantal works with a wide range of white table wines."

Donna and her husband Jim, who is a third generation dairyman, sold their cows in 1997, replacing them with dairy goats. Their herd now numbers approximately 1600, all of which are pastured on 290 acres of grass supplemented by alfalfa hay and brewer’s grain from local breweries. The Pachecos began cheesemaking in 2004. While much of the goat’s milk is sold to a local yogurt producer, Donna holds back as much as she needs in order to make her Capricious, Broncha and Feta cheeses. Capricious is made in the style of a trafitional Californian Dry Jack in that wheels are formed by gathering the curd up tightly in a cloth and rolling it slightly before pressing. The resulting cheese has rounded edges with distinct, rugged indentations on the top side where the cloth has been drawn together and knotted. After pressing, cheeses are aged for between 7-12 months. This gives the cheeses a hard texture with a smooth, slightly waxy rind. Flavors are sweet and almost caramelly with a slightly assertive finish. Pacheco says she loves Capricious with pear, figs and apples or grated over asparagus and pasta salads. “I love to take a fig in season cut off the top and put a little piece of Capricious inside of the fig and bake it for 10 minutes.”"

Capriella,Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,3 in ball,0.5 lbs,www.mozzco.com,CowGoat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses. Capriella is a mozzarella produced using 50% cow’s milk and 50% goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is sourced from Dairy Farmers of America, and goat’s milk sourced from different grade “A” farms in Texas and Oklahoma. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized. Starter cultures are added along with rennet. Once coagulated, the curd is cut both horizontally and vertically by hand with cheese knives, forming small soft cubes and releasing a quantity of excess whey. The curds are allowed to “rest” in the whey until they reach the correct texture. At this point, hot water is poured over them and the curds are stretched and worked with a small paddle until they become malleable, smooth and satin-like in texture. This is the most crucial and skilled part of the cheesemaking process, because there’s only a small window of opportunity to stretch the curd. If the curd is worked before the pH level reaches 5.2, it becomes tough and inferior. However, if the pH falls too low, the curd won’t form into cheese. Assuming all goes well, desired shapes are pinched off from the stretched curd and immediately tossed into cool water to chill down. One chilled, they are briefly placed into a brine solution.Downey soft and cloudlike Capriella has a pliable, almost sticky texture. Taste is very mild with only a whisper of milky flavor and a slight tang.Pair it with a Sauvignon, a Semillon or a Zinfandel."

Although the dairy traditionally specialized in cow’s milk cheeses, in recent times they have expanded their range by buying in additional milk from selected local farmers in the region. For the production of Caprino Tartufo Cremoso, goat’s milk is sourced from a number of farms and brought back to Caseificio La Bottera where it is pasteurized and enriched with cream. The milk is allowed to acidify and traditional rennet added to coagulate the milk. Handling the curd very gently to preserve moisture, it is transferred into molds to drain under its own weight. No additional pressure is added. After draining, the young, fresh cheeses are removed from the molds and several wafer-thin shavings of black truffle, sourced from nearby Alba, are placed on the top rind. The cheeses mature for only a few days before release and Caprino Tartufo Cremoso is best consumed young. Each small cheese quickly absorbs the wonderfully fragrant earthy aroma and flavor from the truffles which combine with the rich, clean flavors of cream and a gentle goat-like tang. The texture is soft and very spreadable and the cheese is bone white in color topped with the delicate truffle shavings. Caprino Tartufo Cremoso pairs very well with sparkling or fruity white wines as well as gently flavored breads such as walnut."

Cardo,Sleight Farm,United Kingdom,Somerset,"1.5” tall, 6” diameter",3 lbs,,Goat,,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Washed,,,"For over 30 years, since the late 1970s, Mary Holbrook has been a pioneer cheese-maker in Somerset, England. Originally trained as an archeologist, Mary learned cheese making by visiting producers in France, Portugal, Italy and Greece; and by extensive reading. She began making feta style cheeses as a hobby using the milk of goats that had originally been family pets, but it soon turned into a passion and the family pets were the basis of her initial herd, a task that was full of trials since many of the goats had not been trained to cope with herd life. At Sleight Farm near Bath, she now raises a mixed herd of Saanen, Anglo-Nubian, Boer, Alpine and mixed-breed goats that produce the milk she uses in the production of her raw milk cheeses. Mary’s travels have heavily influenced her cheese making. The goat cheeses she had learned to make in France inspired the first cheeses she produced. Then in the 1990s Mary shifted focus to Portuguese cheese making techniques in the development of new cheeses. Cardo is an example of the cheeses developed by Dr. Holbrook that were inspired by Portuguese techniques. It is made using a solution of the stamens of a Cardoon thistle steeped in water as the coagulant. Cardoon produces a similar chemical to traditional, animal-based rennet, which coagulates the milk in the cheese making process. Once the stamens have been steeped in water, they are strained out and the solution is poured into the fresh, raw goat’s milk. After an hour, Mary and a fellow cheese maker cut the curds using their hands and arms, a very unusual technique, which creates curds of uneven sizes. This ensures that each wheel of Cardo has a unique texture. Once the curds are cut, some of the whey is removed by hand using small containers, then the rest of the whey is drained off at a slow pace. The curds are then scooped into molds where the curds continue to expel whey, with no additional pressure or weight, over 24 hours. The cheeses are removed from their molds and washed with a brine solution. Mary then takes the cheeses to Neal’s Yard Dairy for aging over a period of several weeks, during which time the cheeses are periodically washed with a brine solution. The resulting cheese has a tacky, grey-orange rind. The paste is deep ivory in color with an unctuous breakdown just under the rind. The rich, moist interior is dotted with rustic small eyes throughout.Cardo’s flavor is pungent and meaty with floral undertones and hints of artichokes from the Cardoon rennet. Cardo is made March through October.This is a cheese that works best with earthy, leathery red wines."

Goat`s Leap has built a deserved reputation for very high quality cheese from their small production and their herd of LaMancha goats. Over the years, they have developed excellent dairy and milking genetics in the herd, which have greatly helped other American LaMancha dairies improve their stock. Goat`s Leap is a seasonal dairy. Cheesemaking normally commences in April and lasts until late October or early November. The cheeses that Barbara makes also reflect the seasons. Every day, weather permitting, the goats are taken out onto the hillside above the house to browse the native California shrubs and bushes. Barbara makes a variety of predominently younger, mold ripened cheeses in the tiny cheese room, just up the hill from the house. What sets Barbara`s cheeses apart is not just the flavor but their texture. Starting with very high quality milk, Barbara handles the curd for her cheeses with great dexterity that results in some of the finest, silkiest textures of any American cheeses on the market.

Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, in the early 1990`s Cindy Callahan made the decision to change direction, starting a sheep farm. After initially focusing on lamb production, the Callahans were encouraged to develop their sheep into a milking herd. This, combined with a trip to Italy where they had the opportunity to taste many local sheep`s milk cheeses inspired them to start to experiment with cheesemaking. The sheep at Bellwether Farm consist mainly of East Friesian ewes. The ewes give birth to between one and three lambs each year and the lambs stay with their mother for 45 days before the ewe joins the milking line. Each ewe gives, on average, slightly less than one gallon a day and they are milked for eight months before the cycle begins again. The sheep graze freely year round in addition to being given grain and alfalfa as necessary. Cindy`s Callahan son Liam oversees cheese production while his wife Diana manages the office and Cindy focuses on taking care of the sheep. In addition to making a range of sheep`s milk cheeses, the Callahans also buy in local Jersey cow`s milk in order to make a range of cow`s milk cheeses. Renowned for its rich, buttery characteristics, Jersey milk has a higher fat and protein content than most milks, which gives the cheeses a wonderfully rich, balanced flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Made from pasteurized milk, Carmody is a semi-soft cheese that is aged for at least six weeks before release. The interior paste is a deep golden yellow in color - a result of the Jersey milk with a springy, slightly fudge-like texture. Flavors are buttery and rich with tastes of milk, grass and butterscotch and a bright citrus-like tang on the finish."

So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced. Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012. Inspired by Camembert, Carolina Moon is made of pasteurized Jersey cow’s milk, giving it a different character than the traditional cheese made from the milk of Normandie cows. The name of the cheese was inspired by its appearance. It looks like the full moons seen in the Carolinas, where the cheese is produced. With a 4-week aging, the cheese has a balance of clean flavors combined with butter and hints of hay and mushrooms. The texture is yielding and unctuous. This cheese pairs nicely with brut sparkling wines and can be served easily with fresh fruits such as apples and grapes."
Carrigalene - Smoked,Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese,Ireland,Co. Cork,"7 ins diameter, 4-5 ins high",4 lbs,www.Carrigalinecheese.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Waxed,,,"Ann and Pat O’Farrell have been making cheese Carrigaline Farmhouse cheese at their dairy near the village of Carrigaline in East Cork, Ireland since 1982. This was the same year the reduction in milk quotas acted as such a spur to the commencement of farmhouse cheesemaking all over Ireland. After attending a cheesemaking course in 1983-84 and some three years of experimentation and market research, Pat and Ann were finally ready to launch their first cheese, Carrigaline Plain in 1986. Milk for production was originally sourced from Pat’s father’s forty acre dairy farm, which has been in the family for several generations. Although Pat and Ann took it over in 1987, in 2000 Pat made the decision to focus entirely on the cheesemaking and give up milk production. They now lease the property to a tenant farmer and the O’Farrells buy their milk from a neighbor to whom Pat transferred his milk quota in 2000. The herd consists of pedigree Friesians grazing on rich, limestone pasture. The name Carrigaline is derived from the Gaelic words Carraig-Ui-Leighin meanign “Rock of the Lynes”. The Lynes were an old Irish family who built a stone castle on a high hill consisting of limestone rock in 1170 AD. Anne & Pat’s farm lies in the shadow of the now crumbling castle. The O’Farrells make three types of cheese at Carrigaline; a natural, plain cheese, a version made with garlic and herbs and a smoked version. Smoked Carrigaline is smoked over beechwood that is sourced from the nearby Coolmore estate. Made year round, cheeses are cooked and pressed before being coated in brown wax which helps to preserve moisture.With a texture similar to Danish Havarti, Smoked Carrigaline has a firm yet supple texture with occasional holes of “eyes”. Flavors are delicate, buttery and mild with a gentle tang on the finish and become more assertive with age.Carrigaline Smoked has multiple uses ranging from cheese boards to cooking and just eaten in a sandwich."
Cascaval,Various,Romania,Various,,,,SheepCow,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,,SmokedWaxed,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),Smoked,"Cascaval is a Romanian cheese that was traditionally made only from raw sheep’s milk. However the name today has expanded, referring to a number of yellow firm pasta filata cheeses produced using cow and/or sheep’s milks. Since 2005, many regional variations of the cheese have been protected as PDO (Protected Denomination of Origin) products at the E.U. level, including Cascaval de Moeciu, Cascaval de Sibiu and Cascaval de Tarnita. Resembling caciocavallo in name, taste and production process, it’s easy to recognize that cascaval is a distant relative of the famous Italian cheese. While it’s commonly believed that the name caciocavallo results from the cheese having been attached to ropes on either side of a horse’s (cavallo’s) back, some Slovenian historians have argued that Romanian cascaval originated not in Italy, but was instead created by a group of native Balkans known as the Aromanians. They argue that the word cas(cheese) was combined with cavalloto refer to the movement of the Aromanians to the mountain pastures during summer. In any case, similar versions of this cheese can be found not only in Italy and Romania, but also throughout the modern-day Balkans and even in the Middle East.Cascaval is rindless with a firm yellow paste. Flavor is mild, salty and slightly sharp. Many smoked versions are also available.Cascaval is ubiquitous in Romanian cuisine. It’s featured in some of the most popular national dishes, such as cascaval pane, in which it’s coated in bread crumbs and fried, and in mamaliga cu branza, a dish made from cornmeal, sour cream and cheese. It also works well in sandwiches and as a snacking cheese. Pair it with a pilsner."

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt, who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” To produce Casco Bay Dulse, the milk is first gently batch pasteurized–at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer—in an effort to preserve the integrity of Smiling Hill Farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. Milk is then cultured and renneted, and the curd is cut and ladled into molds without further heating. The process is the same as in the production of Silvery Moon’s Queso de Verano, except that in this case layers of of dulse—a red seaweed harvested off the coast of maine—are incorporated into the squares. The dulse, supplied by VitaminSea Seaweed in Buxton, Maine, is known for its nutritious protein, mineral and vitamin content. Smelling of fresh cream with hints of sourness, this is a mild and springy-textured fresh cheese punctured with colorful layers of the seaweed. Flavor mild, slightly sweet with a yogurty tang. Notes of toast and sesame seeds can be detected.On a cheese plate, pair Casco Bay Dulse with honey. Or simply crumble it over a salad."
Cashel Blue,J & L Grubb Ltd.,Ireland,Tipperary,"6 ins diameter,  4 ins high",3-4 lbs,www.cashelblue.com,Cow,,Semi SoftBlue,Vegetable,Natural,Blue,,"Located in Co. Tipperary, Ireland, Cashel Farmhouse Cheesemakers is a family farm with a long tradition of food and farming in the area. The 150-acre property at at Beechmount was originally purchased by Louis Grubb`s father in the 1930s. While Grubbdidn’t originally intend to carry on his parents’ tradition of farming, his father’s premature death in 1978 wrested him out of his career at the Irish agricultural research institute. In 1979, Grubb transformed the 120-acre mixed Beechmount Farm into a dairy farm, establishing a herd of 90 Friesian cows, but he quickly became disillusioned with churning out high volumes of milk. To make things more interesting—and profitable—Louis decided to turn to cheesemaking. Enter Jane Grubb, Louis’s wife. A trained chef, she devoured cheesemaking courses run by Veronica Steele, a pioneer of modern Irish farmhouse cheese. Soon, noting that Danish Blue was being imported into Ireland, she suggested the farm develop an Irish version and corner the market. Her notion was revolutionary; While there had been occasional attempts to mass-produce a blue cheese in Ireland, an artisan blue was unheard of. Checking out a recipe for Danish Blue from the library, Jane experimented on the Grubbs’ kitchen stove with an heirloom copper jam pan (later upgraded to a copper cider vat). Big linen bags full of draining curds dripped into buckets set on the concrete floor with cheeses ripening underfoot in the earthen cellars.Named after the Rock of Cashel, a bold outcrop overlooking the Tipperary plains, Cashel Blue`s production of has grown considerably over the years, gaining a reputation as one of Ireland`s most famous blue cheeses.  These days, the wheel is produced in a modern, professional creamery—the rooms full of stainless steel equipment where curd is cut, young cheeses are brine-bathed, and aged rounds are wrapped in distinctive gold foil. And it`s all overseen by Jane`s daughter Sarah Furno, alongside her husband Sergio, who have been running the creamery since 2003.  During cheesemaking the milk is pasteurized, cooled, inoculated with Penicillium Roqueforti culture, and left at 89°F to ripen and allow the acidity to rise. Rennet is then added and the milk is left to coagulate for an hour. After the curd is cut, it is allowed to rest for another hour before being removed from the vat in a linen cloth, drained and transferred into the molds. For the next two or three days cheeses are left to drain and turned regularly until they are dry enough for salting and piercing. The piercing process involves the cheeses being placed on a turntable and rotated whilst being pierced with long stainless steel needles. This allows air to enter the cheese, which then reacts with the enzymes and causes the development of the blue veins. When young, Cashel is firm and relatively moist with a fresh, lactic and slightly sharp flavor.With age, cheeses develop a melt-in-the-mouth buttery texture and a rounder, mellower flavor.Pair Cashel Blue with a Connemara Whiskey, a zingy Riesling, or a stout."
Cashmere,Haystack Mountain Goat Cheese,United States,Colorado,,8 oz,www.haystackgoatcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),," Cow’s milk cheeses are a relatively new venture for this Longmont, Colorado-based dairy, which was founded as a farmstead goat operation in 1989. It was run for nearly two decades by founder and retired teacher Jim Schott, until he ceased his daily creamery work in 2008. Around that time, the dairy began a partnership with the Skyline Correctional Facility in Cañon City, purchasing milk from the facility’s goat farm—a consistent, quality milk source that offers training opportunities for inmates. (For more info, check out culture’s 2012 photo essay on the partnership.) The cow’s milk cheeses, released in mid-2015, are made with organic milk that’s sourced from a local dairy. Made from a mix of organic cow’s milk and cream, Cashmere is a small mold-ripened disk with a white, fuzzy rind.Beneath a slightly thick white rind, Cashmere’s interior is luscious and creamy. Smelling lactic with notes of raw button mushrooms and bread, it is milk-like in flavor, rounded out with slightly bitter notes from the rind. Vegetal,salted butter and buttercup flower aromas can be detected.Pair it with a Hefeweizen."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Made from a blend of sheep, goat and cow’s milk, rounds of Caso Bolo Mellage are formed into a spherical four pound ball. Cheeses are aged for a minimum of two years, this cheese develops some wonderfully complex flavors. As might be expected, the texture is firm and dotted with small crystalline nuggets of calcium. When cut,the cheese tends to break into shards much in the same way good chocolate would. Flavors of butterscotch, hazelnuts and grass characterize this cheese and complement the sweet notes of the milk.Good pairings include Cabernet and Zinfandel."
Casolet,Various,Italy,Val di Sole Trentino or Südtirol,Varies,4 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Casolet is produced in the Adamello mountain region of northern Italy from cow`s milk. Named ""Casolet"" as a derivative from the Latin ""caseolus"" meaning small cheese, these wheels are produced from milk left over from making Puzzone or Vezzena cheeses. Formed into an unusual square shape, the rind of each cheese is stamped with the Rosa Camonica - an imprint of a rose that was found in the famous prehistoric rock carvings of Capo di Ponte. Whole milk from two milkings (morning and evening) is used for production and is sourced from a number of local dairies with herds of mainly Brown Swiss and Friesian Holstein cows. Cheeses are made with either pasteurized or raw milk, and generally weigh between 3.3 - 5.5 lbs. During production, which takes place throughout the year, the curd is cut to about the size of a walnut. This allows for a higher retention of moisture in the finished cheese. After being unmolded, wheels are brined for six hours before being transferred to aging rooms where they are matured for between 20 - 60 days.Casolet is generally preferred young or semi-matured. At this stage, the texture is tender, semi-soft, and pliable with a white or straw-yellow colored interior paste dotted with small holes. Flavors are sweet and milky, with subtle hints of herbs and mushrooms. If allowed to mature for longer, flavors intensify and the texture becomes firmer and drier.Casolet pairs well with most white wines."
Caspian (Ceased Production),Jasper Hill Farm,,Vermont,"3-4 ins diameter, 1 in high",8 oz,,Cow,,Soft,,Leaf Wrapped,,,"Brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler bought Jasper Hill Farm in 1998. Jasper Hill is located in the beautiful, rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont. When they bought the farm, it was extremely run-down, but in 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 45 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. Andy is largely responsible for the management of the pasture and the herd, which grazes from late spring to early fall. Over the years he has improved the grazing land at Jasper Hill by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. Mateo focuses on the cheese production, and Jasper Hill`s range includes Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Caspian, Moses Sleeper and Winnimere. Named after a local lake, Caspian is a new creation that is based on a Robiola recipe with a lactic set. For production, milk is acidified very slowly over a period of 18 hours before being gently ladled into forms and allowed to drain naturally. This allows for a greater retention of moisture. Cheeses are transferred to a maturing room for a period of about 20-30 days. Shortly before shipping they are wrapped in vine leaves that have been harvested from Boyden Valley Winery. the leaves have also been pre-soaked in VT Ice Cider. Caspian has a meltingly soft and oozy paste beneath its exterior casing of leaves. Due to the short aging time there is no rind development, but the cheese takes on some of the vegetal flavors of the vine leaves as well as a hint of the alcohol. "

Awarded Portugese DOP (name protected) status, there are three types of Castelo Branco, with sheep’s milk being the most usual version. In addition, there is also a mixed sheep and goat’s milk version that is matured for approximately 45 days and a a more mature, stronger version, made using animal rennet, aged for a minimum of 120 days. Milk is sourced from the Merino da Beira Baixa breed of sheep. For production, milk is coagulated using thistle rennet. This is a natural vegetable rennet derived from the stamens of the cardoon thistle, which naturally grows wild in the countryside where the cheese is made. After coagulation, the curd is cut and the whey slowly drained off before being placed into cheese molds for pressing. After unmolding, cheeses are matured for a period of at least 45 days. When the aging is prolonged to 90 days or more, cheeses become firmer in texture and slightly brittle. The interior pale, texture of Castelo Branco is semi soft, encased within a firmer, darker yellow rind. Flavors are tangy with a slightly spicy and sour finish."

Cathare,,France,Languedoc,"4 ins diameter, 0.5 ins high",4oz,,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced in the Languedoc region of southwestern France, Cathare is a delicate, flat disc of goat cheese, covered with charcoal ash and a light dusting of white mold. It is instantly recognizable for the imprint of the Occitane cross (the crest of the Languedoc region) that decorates its upper edge. The production of Cathare is fermier (farmstead). It is a particularly challenging cheese to make and mature, partly due to its thin, disc-like format, which makes it fragile and gives the cheese a high surface area-to-volume ratio. If mishandled, cheeses can dry out very quickly. Cathare is usually matured for two or three weeks, and if all goes according to plan, the paste is fragile, creamy and bone-white in color when young, eventually becoming drier and more ivory-colored with age. Flavors can either be mild or strong, again depending on age. When young, flavors are delicate and mildly goaty, with a characteristic hint of citrus and fresh, bright notes of milk and grass. With older cheeses, these flavors intensify."

As of 2009, however, the OG blue is back and better than ever. A certified organic cheese, Caveman Blue is made using a complex combination of starter cultures and molds that require long production and aging time. During production, the curd is handled very carefully to allow greater moisture retention. After, the wheels are aged in limestone caves.  Rogue Creamery was originally founded in 1933 as a cooperative creamery. In 2002,David Gremmels and his partner bought Rogue on a handshake from Ig Vella of Vella Cheese Company. Today, Rogue is a thriving business that produces a variety of award-winning cheeses including multiple blues and cheddars.   Milk for production comes from their own organic dairy in nearby Grants Pass. The dairy has 68 acres with a quarter-mile frontage on the Rogue River—a beautiful piece of property in a valley that used to be loaded with small dairies of 15-20 cows. Now, the Rogue Creamery Dairy has 180 cows, most of which are Brown Swiss and Holsteins. When the weather permits, the cows go out on pasture daily from March to November. The cows are not exclusively grass-fed, as they also feed on organic hay and grain. Caveman is a well-rounded blue with sweet and nutty flavors that are balanced by spice and pepper. Notes of buttermilk and a touch of tropical fruit also come through. The pale golden paste is moist and dense in texture and shot through with green-blue veins.Caveman Blue makes a wonderful accompaniment to fruit and nut-studded crisps, stewed shallot compote, or a contrasting orange marmalade.

It was one of the first commercial goat dairies in New York State when it opened in 1982, and was best known for its French-style chèvre and Mediterranean Feta. In 1995 the farm was bought by Steve and Suzanne Messmer. Suzanne soon began making Cayuga Blue. While it was initially conceived as a goat milk version of classic French Roquefort, over the years Cayuga Blue has developed a unique identity. Steve and Suzanne`s son, Pete Messmer, is now head cheesemaker at Lively Run. In producing Cayuga Blue, his goal is to make a well-veined, natural-rinded blue cheese that is both subtle and complex.This award-winning wheel is mellow, nutty and earthy, complemented by notes of portobello mushroom and the slight spiciness of the P. roqueforti mold. Because it`s made with goat`s milk, the blue mold tends to be less sharp than it might be in a cow`s or sheep`s milk blue, although the flavors of goat`s milk are often quite pronounced.Cayuga Blue stands up well to fairly powerful wines and beers. For wines, try it with a reisling or lemberger from the Finger Lakes Region, or a decent pinot noir. For beers, pair it with an oatmeal stout or a porter. For liquor, try a Scotch (Glenfiddich or perhaps a smoky Islay variety such as Laphroig)."

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, such as the famous Hoja Santa and this similarly creative cheese known as Cella. Cella is made from a combination of goat’s milk, which is sourced from grade “A” dairies in Oklahoma and Texas, and cow’s milk sourced from Dairy Farmers of America. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized. Starter cultures and microbial rennet are added, and milk is left to coagulate slowly overnight. The following day the curd is carefully hand-ladled into small, perforated molds. The gentle handling of the curd greatly helps to preserve moisture and its delicate structure, which in turn contributes to the texture of the finished cheese. The curd is left to drain in the molds for 24 hours before being turned out onto cheese mats where discs are dry salted and left to drain further. The cheeses are turned and salted daily to encourage even drainage of the whey and, when they’re ready, wrapped in lemongrass leaves. Cheeses are aged for between a few weeks and a few months.Cella has a distinctive scent that’s both goaty and fruity, with strong notes of lime and oats. When young, its texture tends to be slightly chalky and crumbly. With time, the texture breaks down, becoming creamier and smoother. Cow’s milk contributes a richness to the flavor, while goat’s milk contributes a tang. Flavor is herbal, strong and complex, with notes of wildflowers, brambles, bitter pith and smoke.Mozzarella Company`s cheesemakers suggest pairing Cella with a Pinot Grigio from Tamas Estates, or with a Sauvignon Blanc from Chateau Chevre."

It`s mainly produced by farmers or cheese retailers around France`s Poitou-Charentes region—and hard to find elsewhere. This area has been long renowned for high-quality goat cheese production. Goats were first introduced here with the arrival of the Saracens in the eighth century, together with their goats and their recipes for cheeses. Fortunately for us, both the goats and the cheese knowledge remained after the invaders were forced out. Chabichou du Poitou is made in both raw and pasteurized milk versions, although only the pasteurized version is allowed to be sold in the United States. The cheese is usually released at a minimum age of two weeks. Some are matured beyond this and enjoyed is enjoyed at five to six weeks. Shaped like a small cylinder, they have wrinkled natural rinds, sometimes dotted with the occasional gray patch, a result of Geotrichum candidummold.The interior texture is dense-yet-velvety at the center when young, with a fresh, clean, and mildly-sweet goaty tang.

Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States. Having always been passionate about goats, Laura started her dairy in a former snail-processing plant in Santa Rosa. In 2006 she sold the company to French family cheese producers, Laiteries H. Triballat, who continue the tradition of Laura Chenel’s cheesemaking of both fresh and aged cheese. Milk for production comes from family goat dairies located in California and Nevada.High quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure excellent animal health, nutrition and general well being. Production of the fresh goat`s milk Chabis comes in three different flavors: Original (plain), Herbs and Four Peppercorn.The texture of the cheeses is soft and slightly fluffy. The flavored varieties have a delicate layer of seasoning on the surface of the cheese, as opposed to having it mixed into the paste. Flavors are pleasantly fresh and mild, with a citrus-like tang. The herbed Chabis has distinct hints of thyme while the peppered version is pleasantly spicy yet balanced by the cream-like notes of the cheese.Chabis pairs perfectly with figs or rolled with thinly sliced proscuitto."
Chai BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,Cheddar-like,Flavor added to rind,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. Primarily renowned for their production of hard and Italian style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facilities. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing. This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings. For production of Chai BellaVitano, wheels of BellaVitano Gold are hand-coated with a robust blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Flavors of tropical fruit and sweet cream from the interior paste of the cheese balance and mingle with the chai rind, resulting in a cheese that can either be eaten alone or used in cooking.Chai BellaVitano pairs well with truffles, dark chocolate, figs, oranges and coconut. Good wine pairings include Asti Spumante, Moscato and Lambrusco. Beers include Belgian White Beer, Belgian Tripel Style, Weisse Beer and sparkling and still ciders."
Chällerhocker,Kaserei Tufertschwil,Switzerland,Saint-Gallen,11.5 in diameter x 4 in height,14 lbs,www.columbiacheese.com,Cow,Thermalised,Firm,Animal,Washed,Alpine-style,,"Created by Walter Rass, the master cheesemaker at Käserei Tufertschwil in the canton of Saint-Gallen, Chällerhocker is a twist on traditional Swiss cheese. The recipe is based on Appenzeller, which Walter, as a second generation producer has many years of experience making. Despite its similarities, Chällerhocker differs considerably from Appenzeller due to changes in the recipe (the temperature the curd is cooked at, the fact that Walter chooses not to skim the fat off of the milk, and aging time). Unlike most producers in Switzerland, Walter likes to make his own rennet rather than relying strictly on the commercial type. The name of the cheese roughly translates to “sitting in a cellar”, which is exactly what it does, for ten months. During that time it is regularly washed with brine. Chällerhocker production began in 2003 and was part of the new wave of innovative cheesemaking in Switzerland. The dairy was originally founded in 1896 and Walter’s father, also a cheesemaker bought the dairy in 1987. Walter works with dairy farmers located within about a mile’s radius of the dairy, each of which owns an average of about 15 cows that are mostly Brown Swiss. Twice daily the farmers bring the milk directly to the dairy and cheese is made once each day. Villagers and locals can also stop by the dairy to buy Chällerhocker.Chällerhocker is an extremely complex Swiss cheese. Its texture is dense, and silky-smooth. The rind is slightly tacky and smells of caramel, roasted peanuts and aging meat. Chällerhocker tastes of brown butter and melted leeks with a salted caramel finish.Pairing suggestions include fortified wines that have some nuttiness such as Sherry or Madeira. The best way to enjoy this cheese is at room temperature as a table cheese, or in highly indulgent mac-and-cheese or gratin dishes."

Originally from New Zealand, both Jean and Linnea were raised on farms. They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into a property in Maine that has belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Chamoose is a bloomy rind double crème ‘mini brie’ which is made using organic Jersey cow’s milk that the Koons buy from a neighbor’s farm. After a friend who visits France regularly told them that the cheese reminded her of Chaource, the Koons decided to name it ‘Chamoose’ as a local take on the name.

Sons and a daughter represent the fifth generation already at work on the organic dairy farm, La Ferme Louis d’Or, and—across the street in the village of Sainte-Élizabeth de Warwick—at La Fromagerie du Presbytère. The farmstead cheese business takes its name from the rectory (presbytère, in French), which the Morins acquired in 2005 from the Roman Catholic church next door. Cheesemaking began in 2007. Champayeur is an old French term that designates a herd grazing on fresh pasture. The bloomy rind cheese was itself inspired by similar-looking traditional French goat cheeses that are produced using lactic fermentation (although this version is produced using cow’s milk).

Made in Wisconsin in the style of a clothbound British cheddar, the wheels—made from a 70/30 blend of cow’s and goat’s milk—can be aged anywhere from six months to two years, ever-evolving and becoming more complex. When Larry Hedrich’s grandparents settled on a Wisconsin farm in the early 1900s, they named the land “Chandoka” after their children: Charmaine, Ann, Donna and Kathy. Larry and his wife Clara moved back to that land in 2012 to expand the cheesemaking business they’d built along with their four children, who all work at LaClare farms today; this cheese is thus named for the land it’s made on. The does raised here have room to exercise and graze on pasture, and are fed whole grains and other foods that goats love. The Hedrich family began working alongside Chicago-based Standard Market early on in the development of this cheese, with the aim of creating a clothbound-style version of their successful block cheddar that could be aged in Standard Market’s caves. In 2017, following Chandoka`s nationwide success, the family built an on-site aging cave devoted to aging the cheese, hiring affineur David Rogers of Standard Market to oversee the aging program. Here, fresh wheels are larded and bound in cloth before being aged for an average ofeight months, all the way up toone and a half years.With an ivory tinge and light-gold paste, texture of Chandoka is dense and toothsome. Flavor is intensely vegetal with notes of butter, lemon, and pasture, while some wheels yield hintsof buttermilk, cured meats, cooked carrots and straw.Pair it with an unfiltered Cabernet Franc, a Côtes du Rhône, or a Sémillon. For beer pairing, try a cider or a saison."
Chaource,Various,France,Champagne or Burgundy,"2-3 ins diameter, 3 ins high",8oz,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Named after a market town in the Champagne region of France, Chaource is a soft, mild cylindrical cow`s milk cheese. Records show that it has been produced since the 14th century, when farmers sold it as an accompaniment to Champagne at the Champagne fairs in Troyes. The tradition of drinking champagne with Chaource continues today.Production of Chaource can be either artisinal or industrial, and cheeses can be made from either raw or pasteurized milk, although, for artisanal production, raw cow`s milk is used. Coagulation is mainly lactic and the cheeses are ladled by hand, keeping the curd mild, light and moist. Cheeses are not pressed, and mature for a minimum of two weeks. However, given the correct cellar humidity, aging can take as long as two months.Chaource are at their best in April and May, due to lush spring grass and the new season`s milk.Younger cheeses have a fresh and slightly tart flavor. However, the majority that find their way onto American retail counters are usually more mature. Typically, a soft, white and sometimes quite thick, bloomy rind develops which can taste slightly bitter - in which case it`s best just to consume the interior.Despite it`s richness, the interior has a piquant, slightly fruity flavor with a distinct note of butter and mushrooms.Pair with a Chablis, Nuit St Georges, Sancerre or Champagne."

Moser comes from a cheese maker family. His father produced a variety of Swiss classic hard and semi hard cheeses such as Tilsiter and Emmentaler in the Thurgau region. Upon completion of his cheesemaking apprenticeship, Moser moved to France where he worked - and fell in love - with the French soft ripened cheeses there. After his return to Switzerland, he bought the dairy in Dotzigen and for several years divided his time and labor between his father’s business, where he made classic Swiss cheeses and his new venture where he produced only soft cheeses. Quintessentially, Moser is an excellent cheesemaker who is also a good businessman. His facility is modern, efficient and streamlined and the cheeses he makes are reliably consistent. As such, he has positioned his business to supply larger customers such as grocery store chains as well as smaller independent stores. Moser works exclusively with cow’s milk sourced from larger milk co-operatives. With the exception of his Crublanc which is made from raw milk, all Moser’s products pasteurized.  For production of the Chardonnay, Moser adds a blend of 2/3 of thermophilic and 1/3 of mesophilic starter cultures, which contribute greatly to the cheese’s character. The surface of the cheese is innoculated with aerobic yeast cultures as well as a geotricum mold. The latter controls the growth of the yeast and keeps the surface from becoming too wet. Once the curd is in the forms, the young cheeses are allowed to drain under their own weight. This expels some of the whey and allows the curd to knit together. During the first 24 hours, the cheeses are turned or flipped three or four times which promotes the even distribution and drainage of moisture and then placed in a brine bath for 90 minutes. The next stage is the aging room. There, the cheeses are kept for between eight and ten days at a humidity of between 85-95% and a temperature of between 58-60?F - lower humidity and higher temperature in the beginning, higher humidity and lower temperature towards the end. During this time, the Chardonnay receives a second bath, this time comprised entirely of wine, for a period of twelve hours. The wine Moser uses is aged in a steel tank, meaning that the yeast cultures stay alive and influence the cheese mainly within its paste. The anaerobic yeasts help to transform the protein which contributes to the cheese’s characteristically mild and yet full flavors and gently yielding paste."

The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw/thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. Chardonnay Wash is an aged version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park, originally inspired by the successful pairing of that cheese with chardonnay. The production process for the cheese is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling. While Chardonnay Wash begins as a bloomy-rind cheese, it’s aged quite differently from Battery Park and Charleston Cheesehouse’s other cheeses, in a drier environment. During the beginning of the ripening stage, the cheese is washed in chardonnay and rotated every other day. As a result the cheese develops quite differently during eight weeks of affinage, becoming much more firm with a less visible white surface. Because of its dryness and firmness, one might think that it was a pressed cheese, but it’s not; molds are simply filled with curds, left to rest and periodically flipped.Flaky and crumbly with a dry surface, Chardonnay Wash has a yellow-white paste and a subtle dusting of white fuzzy mold on the rind. Flavor is mild and a bit salty, reminiscent of a goat’s milk Asiago. Aromas of orange zest, butter, oak and toasted pecans can be detected.Pair this cheese with its most obvious companion: a chardonnay."

Granted AOC (name protected) status in 2010, production of Charolais uses a time-consuming method of lactic fermentation, which results in a particularly fine, delicate texture in the end product. This means that instead of rennet being used for coagulation, the milk is allowed to ripen for a period of usually 12-24 hours, at which point is has naturally formed a gel-like curd. The curd is then gently ladled into forms and drained for several more hours before being unmolded. A period of affinage (aging) then takes place over a period of approximately three to four weeks. The rind of Charolais varies with age. When young, the rind is the color of pale straw, fairly soft and wrinkled. With age and as the cheeses lose moisture, the rind becomes firmer and coated in a dove grey and white mold that is often mottled with rust-colored patches.Flavors are rich and sophisticated with fine, clean mineral and nutty notes.Charolais pairs perfectly with fine, white, full bodied red wines such as Burgundy’s Santenay as well as a vintage Champagne."

Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time.

After returning home and realizing that the snack was difficult to find in the U.S., they sensed that there could be a market for the cheese, and so they traveled back to Russia to learn how to make it. After visiting three different production plants and purchasing a recipe from two of them, they started a Kickstarter campaign to raise the money to open the first chechil production company in the US. To make Chechil, pasteurized cow’s milk is made into blocks of curd which are then heated and shaped into distinctive strings, in a method similar to that of other pasta filata cheeses. The braids are then smoked.Chechil is firm and smooth, and when un-braided and peeled, the strings separate into small threads. It is very salty with a strong hickory smoked taste.Because this cheese is so salty and smoky, it is ideally paired with a refreshing beer. Try it with a Pilsner Urquell."

Made with pasteurized milk, it`s covered in black wax to maintain softness during at least one year of aging. Most of us associate the Kerrygold brand with the gold and silver foil-wrapped bars of butter that line U.S. supermarket shelves, but the company churns out plenty of aged cheeses, too. Its roots go back to 1961 when the Irish Dairy Board was established, grouping together some of the small dairy farmers of Ireland in order to promote and export their milk and milk products on the international market. A year later, in 1962, the Kerrygold brand of dairy products was launched in the UK, promoting mostly Irish butter. Over the years, Kerrygold expanded the export and range of its products, including traditional Irish cheeses. Today, Kerrygold dairy products are sold around the world. While the market size is large for Kerrygold products, the farms that produce the milk are remarkably small, with a tiny average herd size. Most are also multi-generational family farms where the cows are pasture fed for 312 days out of the year, including the months of milk production.This cheese has a rich, smooth texture and unlike many types of cheddar, Kerrygold Aged has no sharpness to it. Instead it has a rich, savory flavor with hints of salted butter and butterscotch sweetness.This cheddar is ideal for use in cooking; melt it into an omelet or place a wedge over a piece of apple pie.

Barber’s cheddar has PDO status and is one of the few certified ""West Country Farmhouse Cheddars"". Barber`s 1833 Vintage Reserve is the company’s flagship cheese. Barber`s places a great emphasis on cheesemaking using traditional methods to ensure both the quality of their cheese and continuity of local traditions. To further their mission, they`ve created a specialist laboratory dedicated to the preservation of natural mixed cultures. The cultures were first developed generations ago from natural bacteria found in local milk. After being swapped among local cheesemakers for many years, they were saved from extinction, refined to isolate the best strains and are now preserved for continued use. Barber`s is the only local cheesemaker still using these cultures in the production of block cheddar. In cooperation with the ""West Country Farmhouse Cheddar"" PDO restrictions, Barber`s cheddars are made only with local milk, on the farm using traditional methods. The curds are stacked by hand to ensure that the right `cheddaring` effect is achieved and all cheeses are assessed by a professional grader to ensure a high level of quality before release. In a move to become more environmentally sustainable, Barber`s has created an advanced system for refining the whey that`s left over from cheesemaking. It`s split into four separate products: cream, protein, lactose, and water. The cream is churned to make butter, the protein is concentrated and dried into a powder, the lactose is used as livestock feed, and the water is used to wash and clean dairy. Barber`s 1833 Vintage Reserve Cheddar, their flagship cheese, is chosen from Barber`s cheddars that have been carefully selected for their keeping qualities. After 3 months, all cheeses are graded by an expert who determines quality of the cheese and when the flavor profile will be at its best. The Vintage Reserve is always aged for a minimum of 24 months, and represents Barber`s` ""summit of achievement"".Barber’s 1833 is a creamy, sharp cheddar, which has both savory and naturally sweet notes.

This results in a richer taste and texture, while maintaining a clean, creamy finish.Cheeses are wrapped in cloth, which allows them to breathe, and helps the flavors concentrate during the maturing process. Each wheel is rubbed with butter and hand turned on a daily basis for the first two months of aging. The schedule then changes to three times per week for the next two months, and once a week thereafter.Aged for about a year, the texture of the Flagship Reserve is firm and smooth, with a slight brittleness to it. Flavors are robust and bold with sweet vegetal notes of earth and butter."

Much of the farm`s energy is drawn from a 10kw wind generator, and there are also solar panels in use.Willi comes from a family of Swiss cheesemakers, and after spending 10 years honing his craft in Europe, he returned to make cheese in Wisconsin – with no on-site cows or production facility. But he did build a cave – a real one carved into a hillside. He also built a straw-lined, above-ground aging facility. The only milk he uses is organic and pasture-raised. Willi makes his cheeses either at the Cedar Grove cheese plant or at the nearby Uplands Dairy, makers of Pleasant Ridge Reserve.Willi`s production of a traditional cloth-wrapped, English style cheddar was inspired by the chance to visit England under a scholarship from the University of Wisconsin`s Center for Dairy Research. There he was able to learn from several cheddar producers - especially Montgomery`s - and put some of their techniques into practice .After production of his cloth-wrapped cheddar, and to give the cheeses a head start with the aging process, Willi spritzes them with a solution of spring water and old cheddar rinds.Cheeses are matured for between one and two years before release. While the majority are sold locally and at the Madison Farmers` Market, Willi has recently started to release some of his cheddars for sale elsewhere in the United States.The texture is smooth, dense and extremely rich, scattered with crystalline ""crunchies."" The interior paste is the color of very pale caramel-cream with no holes.Flavors - especially for the two year cheddar - are incredibly complex and deep. Notes of wood, toast and nuts are present, together with a delicious underlying sweet caramel flavor and a long earthy finish.Lehner suggests washing down his Bandaged Cheddar with Belgian beer, IPA, lager, Pilsners, red wines (Merlot or Pinot Noir) without a lot of tannins, or American cider."

Located near Visalia in the San Jaoquin Valley in California, Bill and Pat ran the farm solely as a dairy operation for several years before making the decision to get into cheese production and to concentrate their efforts on making cheddar.In 2006, the Boersmas made the decision to sell their herd of 80 cows to a neighbor, which has allowed them to focus their attention solely on cheese production. They continue to work closely with, and buy the milk back from the herd`s new owner, thereby ensuring the necessary quality and consistency for cheesemaking.In addition to this development, Bill and Pat have recently formed a partnership with Jonathan Van Ryn, a young artisan cheesemaker who studied cheesemaking at California Polytechnic University. Jonathan`s arrival has allowed Bravo to expand production considerably without compromising quality.Now, in addition to the traditional cheddars, Bravo has gone into the production of Silver Mountain, a cloth bound cheddar that is matured for nine months.Bravo Premium Cheddar is aged for a minimum of 90 days but usually ages about one year before it is released. The texture is firm and smooth, with a creamy mouthfeel.Flavors are buttery and rounded with a pleasant tang and notes of toasted brioche and butterscotch."

The co-operative grew steadily and had reached 600 members by 1960 - even though the number of dairy farms in Vermont was in steep decline.In 1992 Cabot merged with Agri-mark which allowed a considerable expansion of the business and the product lines. Cheese - and in particular cheddar - production grew, and now a number of varieties and ages of cheddar are produced under the Cabot name.Cabot Clothbound Cheddar is the result of a highly successful collaboration between cheesemakers at Cabot`s Vermont Creamery, and The Cellars at Jasper Hill in Vermont.The two businesses are vastly different in terms of the scale and type of production, as Cabot is one of the largest cheese producers in Vermont, whereas Jasper Hill is one of the smallest. Equally, Cabot`s aging facilities and expertise are not suited to maturing cloth wrapped cheddar and Jasper Hill specializes in working with this type of cheese. It`s a collaboration that has proved very beneficial to both companies.Every three months, Cabot Creamery makes 60 cloth wrapped wheels of cheddar and then sends them to Jasper Hill where they are carefully matured in their caves.Matured for a minimum of 10 months, flavors of the Cabot cloth wrapped are of butterscotch and caramel and savory vegetal notes, accompanied by a pronounced tang.The texture is smooth and dense and slightly brittle, with a pale straw-colored intertior paste."

As a result, Crowley Cheese is higher moisture, has a more creamy mouthfeel and is less tangy than some cheddars. Also, cheeses develop their robust flavor fairly early in the maturation process, which means that by one year of age (the minimum age for release) flavors can be quite assertive.Flavors of the Crowley Extra Sharp are rich, buttery and tangy with notes of apricots and pinenuts.The texture is smooth and consistent with occasional holes, or ""eyes,"" and is a pale, golden-yellow color."

Cheddar (Face Rock 12 Month),Face Rock Creamery,United States,Oregon,,40 lbs,www.facerockcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Hard,Microbial,None,Cheddar-like,,"Face Rock Creamery is located in Bandon, Oregon, in one of the oldest cheesemaking areas on the west coast. As early as the 1880s, cheese was being made in the many dairy farms in the Coquille Valley to the east of the town, and in 1936 the Bandon Cheese Factory was founded. The son of the factory’s founder, Brad Sinko, took over and ran it until 2003 when it was bought out by a larger competitor. Sinko then spent 10 years as the head cheesemaker Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle and New York. While Sinko was making cheddars in Seattle, the Bandon Cheese Factory was abandoned and torn down by the company that had purchased it. Locals in the town, including developers Greg Drobot and Daniel Graham, were disappointed to see a gravel pit where the Bandon Cheese Factory once stood. Working alongside the community and the City Council, Drobot and Graham decided to rebuild a structure that would host not only a 9,000 sq. foot creamery, but also a 2,000 sq. foot well retail space and cafe. Today cheese is being made in Bandon once again in this location, and Brad Sinko has returned as head cheesemaker. The name ‘Face Rock’ refers to a local monolithic formation on the Oregon coast that resembles a face looking up at the sky. Face Rock sources all of its milk from Scolari’s Dairy Farm in Coquille, only 15 miles from Bandon. The farm has been owned by the same family since the early 1930s, and today has a herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows. Sinko oversees the production of 1,000 pounds of cheese at Face Rock Creamery each day using traditional techniques. This cheddar is formed into 40-lb blocks and aged for at least 12 months in a plastic coating.Firm and low in moisture, this cheddar is on the mild side.

The farm is home to some 3,000 Holstein cows, of which 1,500 are milked. The remainder are heifers (youngsters) waiting to join the main herd. Cows are housed in, and roam freely around well-ventilated barns that are designed to catch cross breezes. The cows stand on thick, rubber floor mats that are softer on the their legs, and create a buffer between the animals` feet and the concrete floor. They are fed a total mixed ration (TMR) of various grains and hay rather than feeding on pasture.John Fiscalini and his staff pay a great deal of attention to the welfare of their cows, which results in good quality milk.Mariano was formerly head cheesemaker at Shelburne Farms, and developed his first cloth wrapped cheddar there. Now in Modesto, Mariano makes his raw milk cheddars using traditional methods, and ages them for at least 16 months before they are released in limited quantities.Cheese production takes place five days a week, using around 1,000 gallons of milk for each batch.The texture of Fiscalini cloth wrapped cheddar is close and smooth, with a slightly brittle texture reminiscent of a traditional, English-style cheddar.Flavors are rich and complex with savory, buttery notes of earth, fruit and toast."

Hoping to reconnect with the land, animals and food, they moved to rural Georgia and became first-time farmers. Tim and Liz started milking cows and making cheese in 2010. They’d originally just wanted the whey to feed their rare breed Ossabaw Island pigs, but soon fell in love with the cheesemaking process. Today they make a variety of cheeses using only raw milk from their small herd of Jersey cows. The cows graze on organic grasses and hay, and have access to outdoor pastures each day of the year. The Youngs focus on small batches of handmade cheese; milk is stirred by hand, curds are cut and hooped by hand, and aging wheels are brushed, washed, and turned by hand. Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons. Georgia Gold Clothbound Cheddar is inspired by the classic English cheddar cheeses that are bandaged and cave aged. Tim and Liz wrap the cylinders in muslin cloth just after hooping and pressing. They then brush them liberally with melted lard, and age them in the cheese cave for 6-12 months.At 6 months, Georgia Gold truckles are smooth and creamy with bright citric and pineapple flavors; at a year or longer, they become crunchy, crumbly and tangy, and more savory, with a buttery, malty finish.Pair it with a fruity Pinot Noir, a strong ale, apple liqueur or cider, or a vintage port."

Today, Grafton Village Cheese handcrafts artisanal aged cheddar and other specialty cheeses. Proceeds from their sales support the Windham Foundation’s charitable efforts.  Grafton`s Clothbound Cheddar tastes bold and sharp, unctuous and grassy, with notes of mushroom and nuts.

Cheddar (Hook's 10 Year),Hook's Cheese,United States,Wisconsin,"10 ins long, 4 ins square",5.5 lb, www.hookscheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Plastic,,,"Located in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, Hook`s Cheese produces several varieties of cheese, ranging from classic Wisconsin cheddars to several types of blue cheese.Owners Tony and Julie Hook started Hook`s Cheese Company in 1976 and inititally made cheddar and swiss. Since 1980, they have continued to expand their range and have won numerous awards for their cheeses. Hook`s is perhaps best known for its extra aged cheddars and blues. Currently the company is aging an impressive 600,000lbs. of cheese.Milk for production comes from several small, local dairy farms near Mineral Point. The cows are all raised sustainably and without rBGH.The cheddar is produced with a traditional Wisconsin recipe, and released at varying ages of maturity. After production, cheeses are wrapped in plastic, which prevents moisture loss and therefore allows the potential for to be matured for several years. The cheddars are graded regularly throughout the maturation process, and those fitting a particular flavor profile are selected for further aging.Hook`s 10 year cheddar has a dense, close texture punctuated with small, crunchy crystals that are a sign of the cheese`s age. The interior paste of the cheddar is usually orange in color as a result of the addition of anatto (a natural food coloring) during the production process. However, depending on when the cheeses were made, some may have the natural, ""white"" color instead.Flavors are rich and tangy with notes of fruit and grass, and a smooth, elegant finish."
Cheddar (Keen's),Keen's Cheddar Ltd.,United Kingdom,Somerset,"14 ins diameter, 10 ins high",30 lbs or 56 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Cloth Wrapped,,,"Cheddar has been produced at Moorhayes farm near Wincanton in Somerset, England since 1898 when the Keen family family first moved there. Today the farm is still in the family. Stephen Keen and his son Nick oversee the cows and herd management, while Stephen`s brother George makes the cheese with his son James.Milk for cheesemaking comes from the farm`s closed herd of 250 Friesian-Holstein cows that are grazed on the pasture for much of the year.The cheddars produced by the Keens are, along with Montgomery`s and Westcombe, the most traditional English cloth wrapped cheddars available.The Keens only use traditional pint starter cultures for their cheesemaking. These are a yoghurt-like culture, a pint of which is grown in a churn of milk before being added to the vat. These cultures were originally taken from naturally ocurring bacteria in Somerset milk, and the strains continue to be preserved.George and James make 12-14 large wheels of cheese each day. The cheddars are made in two sizes, weighing either 30lb. (known as a half wheel) or the traditional size of 56lbs.After production and unmolding, wheels are wrapped in cheesecloth to protect them during the aging process. Cloth allows the cheese to breathe and lose moisture, and as a result the flavors concentrate.The resulting texture of a typical Keens cheddar is smooth, dense and firm. Occasionally, accidental veins of blue peentrate the cheese from the rind. Although technically speaking these are a fault, they taste delicious and add a subtle blue flavor to that part of the cheese.Flavors are complex and rich, with hints of butterscotch, nuts and fruit, accompanied by a distinctive tang and long finish."

When Jamie Montgomery`s grandfather moved there in 1911, cheese production was already in progress and had been taking place for many years. Made from raw cow`s milk, Montgomery`s cheddar is produced to a very traditional recipe and, for many, has become the ""benchmark"" English farmhouse cheddar. Cheeses are made with milk sourced from the farm`s Friesian-Holstein cows. Before joining the main herd, the young cows roam the fields of South Cadbury, long credited with being the site of the true ""Camelot"". Cheese is made every day to ensure the freshness of the milk, which is vital because it is not heat-treated before use. The starter cultures used for production are the same strains that were used when the family started cheesemaking 70 years ago. Although the cultures are difficult to handle, producing a wide range of flavors, they also possess a great deal of the characteristics, that have become synonymous with Montgomery`s cheddar. As well as being one of the few cheddar makers that still use calf rennet (the traditional source of the enzyme) to start the formation of the curd, Montgomery`s are also possibly the only cheddar producer still using an old, slow, peg mill that produces the unique fissuring and brittleness in the texture of the cheese.Montgomery`s cheddars are usually matured for between 12 and 14 months before release. At this stage, flavors are rich, meaty and robust with sweet - almost caramelized - fruity notes. The occasional wheel presents itself as being suited to aging for 18 months, when the texture is slightly drier and flavors become sweeter and reminiscent of nuts.Atculture,we love this cheese alongside an IPA or an English cider.Madame Fromage recommends pairing it with a Scotch-based Mark Twain cocktail."

Cheddar (Old Quebec Vintage),Agropur,Canada,Quebec,,5 lbs, www.agropur.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,PlasticNone,,,"Made in Quebec, Canada, Old Quebec Vintage Cheddar is produced from heat treated cow`s milk and matured for three to four years.Although production is large, the milk in each vat is treated on an individual basis in order to take advantage of the natural flavors of the milk. The heat treatment too - as opposed to full pasteurization - preserves some of the natural cultures present in the milk.One of the cheesemakers` goals is to produce a cheese that is relatively low moisture. This creates potential for longer aging, as well as the development of more complex flavors and the cheese`s signature sharp tang.After production, cheeses are matured for 9-12 months, prior to being graded on the basis of texture, flavor, aroma, and color. Cheeses that meet the target profile are set aside and transferred to Lancaster County in Pennysylvania for further maturation. At two years, the cheeses are graded again and the best are selected for additional aging of at least another year.The texture of Old Quebec Vintage is low moisture and therefore slightly crumbly. There is frequently a slightly crunchy texture formed by crystallized amino acids - a sign of a mature cheese. The paste is a creamy, white color and there is no rind.Flavors are robust, clean and fruity with notes of butterscotch and an assertive tang."

The mostly Frieisan herd are rotationally grazed for ten months of the year across 290 acres of rich, alluvial pasture, which results in very high quality milk that yields a more flavorful cheddar At the heart of the farm is the 5,000 sq. ft. creamery where cheese production takes place by one of nine skilled cheesemakers. Milk for cheesemaking arrives every morning and is pumped into one of the very large stainless steel vats, heated, and a starter culture and rennet added. Traditional rennet is used for production six days each week, and vegetable rennet is used on the remaining day. After coagulation, the curd is cut, drained of whey and then traditionally ""cheddared,"" meaning that the blocks of curd are stacked and turned to extrude more whey, prior to being salted and milled. Finally the curds are put into cloth-lined molds and pressed before being larded, bound in cheesecloth, and transferred to the maturing rooms for aging. Only cheddars matured for 12-15 months, and, fitting a certain flavor profile, are selected for Quickes Smoked Cheddar. The large wheels are cut down into 3lb pieces to ensure the smoke sufficiently penetrates the cheese. The pieces are then smoked over oak wood chips sourced from trees on the farm. The smoking process adds a spectrum of new flavors to the cheddar, and gives it a pale golden-brown hue. The texture of Quickes Smoked is smooth, dense and slightly crystalline. Flavors are complex, smoky (obviously) and spicy with notes of caramel. This cheese pairs ideally with a creamy English stout or pale ale. With wine, try a lighter red such as Pinot Noir, Gamay Burgundy, or Beaujolais."

Cheddar (Rogue Chocolate Stout),Rogue Creamery,United States,Oregon,3,8 oz,www.roguecreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Vegetable,None,Cheddar-like,Flavor added to paste,"David Gremmels and Cary Bryant bought Rogue Creamery on a handshake from Ig Vella (Vella Cheese Company) in 2002. Rogue was originally founded in 1935 by Ig`s father, Tom, who ran it as a successful creamery for many years. Upon Tom`s death in 1998 (aged 100), Ig took over and then finally sold it to David and Cary in 2002, with the stipulation that they would continue to make the creamery’s signature cheeses according to tradition. Today, Rogue Creamery is a thriving business that produces a variety of award winning cheeses in addition to the originals that the Vella family created. Milk for production comes from Delmar at Rogueview Dairy. Delmar has 70 acres with 1/4 mile frontage on the river - a beautiful piece of property in a valley that used to be loaded with small dairies of 15-20 cows. Delmar started with 90 cows and has grown to 200, where he has held for the past 15 years. The milkers go out on pasture daily, when weather permits, (from March-October), but are not exclusively grass-fed, as they also get hay and grain. Chocolate Stout cheddar is the product of a collaboration between Rogue Creamery and Rogue Ales. Produced since 2007, it was the first of three ""beer cheeses"" that the brewery and creamery have produced together; the other two are Morimoto Soba Ale and Hopyard. Chocolate Stout Cheddar takes the pairing of cheddar and beer to another level by incorporating the ale directly into the cheese vat. The beer is poured over the curd, then allowed to meld before it`s hand-dipped and pressed into blocks for aging. The whole process is handmade in the artisan tradition; it`s handcut and hand milled. The cheese ages for a full 24 months before release.The texture of this cheddar is firm with a marbling of dark ale throughout. Aromas are buttery and creamy, enhanced by a hint of ale. The flavor is savory and tangy and cheddar notes are balanced by the sweeter chocolate and coffee flavors of the stout.Best paired with a Lager or Stout due to its subtle toasted notes. Not as sharp as other cheddars, it also pairs well with a lighter Chardonnay or Syrah."

Cheese Curds,Various,North America,,,,,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,,None,Fresh,,"If you were raised outside the Midwest or have never tried a poutine, you might be wondering why there’s so much hype surrounding these shapeless, lumpy masses. Where do they come from, why do they squeak, and what relation do they have to actual aged cheese? Curds are popular in regions that have a long history of cheddarmaking, particularly in the Midwest and in Canada. In essence, they`re the building blocks of cheddar cheese. They start out like most cheeses do: Milk is coagulated into a gelatinous mass that’s cut into little cubes, which are stirred and heated to remove moisture. In cheddarmaking, those curds are formed together, stacked, and kept warm while acidifying and draining (a process called “cheddaring”).The stacked curds are then re-cut into chunks. If they’re destined to become cheddar, these chunks are salted and pressed into a form—but they can also be eaten just like this, as “cheese curds.” Curds are best if eaten the same day they are made, when their protein strands are elastic; wait any longer, and you risk losing theirsignature squeaky texture. This is an easy task if you live in Wisconsin, wherecurds are served and sold at nearly every corner. But because curds must be eaten fresh, they can be harder to find in places that aren’t cheese curd havens. Look for local cheesemaker shops or farmers markets in your area to find your own. Can’t find a vendor?Making your ownis easier than it sounds.Since cheese curds are fresh by definition, they`re very mild in flavor: lactic and slightly salty, with an addictive, rubbery texture.Like finished cheddars, curds vary from region to region; they can be flavored with herbs and spices, deep fried, or, as in Canada, served over french fries and brown gravy to makepoutine.But we love them best alongside a pilsner—by the handful."

Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States. Having always been passionate about goats, Laura started her dairy in a former snail-processing plant in Santa Rosa. In 2006 she sold the company to French family cheese producers, Laiteries H. Triballat, who continue the tradition of Laura Chenel’s cheesemaking of both fresh and aged cheese. Milk for production comes from family goat dairies located in California and Nevada.High quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure excellent animal health, nutrition and general well being. This cheese is named for the popularity it has enjoyed among chefs and caterers over the past two decades. It’s Laura Chenel’s highest-moisture, freshest cheese, with microbial enzymes and salt being the only ingredients other than goat’s milk. It can be substituted for cream cheese due to a similar texture, with the added bonus of being lower in calories, lower in cholesterol and higher in protein content.With a milky, subtle smell, this cheese is super smooth in texture. It’s bright and lemony-tart, having a surprisingly robust flavor with a clean, inoffensive goatiness and a bright tang at the finish.This cheese is so popular with chefs due to its diverse cooking applications; it melts perfectly into sauces for pasta and poultry, mixes with herbs for topping crostini or filling tortellini, and makes a wonderful goat cheesecake. For drink pairings, try it with a Sauvignon Blanc, which has a tartness and balanced acidity mirroring that of the cheese."

Cheshire (Appleby's),Appleby's of Hawkstone,United Kingdom,Shropshire,"9 ins diameter,  12 ins high",17 lbs,,Cow,,Hard,Vegetable,Cloth Wrapped,,,"Production of Cheshire by the Appleby family takes place at Abbey Farm at Hawkstone in Shropshire, England.Mentioned in the Domesday book of 1,086, Cheshire is England`s oldest named cheese and quite probably was made by the Romans 1,000 years earlier. Almost all modern Cheshire production is mechanized, the one exception being the Appleby family who have made Cheshire cheese for several generations and still produce a hand made, cloth-bound cheese made to a traditional recipe in open vats. Today, the day to day cheesemaking takes place under the guidance of Gary Gray, who works closely with the Appleby`s.Appleby`s Cheshire is made using Friesian milk from the Appleby`s own farm. Their closed herd of 290 cows graze on the salty pastures at the edge of the Cheshire Plain. This is an area extremely rich in minerals, and not surprisingly, one of the main characteristics of traditional Cheshire is a uniquely complex mineral flavor.Cheeses are made using morning and evening milk with the addition of a home produced starter culture. Appleby`s makes both white (uncolored) Cheshire and the more familiar red cheeses, dyed with anatto (a natural coloring derived from the South American Anatto shrub) that has been traditionally used in Chesire production for centuries.For production, the coagulated milk is cut, stirred, scalded very slightly, stirred continuously until the correct acidity is acheived. It is then cut into blocks and broken - as opposed to being stacked and flipped, which is the process for cheddar production. Finally, the curds are salted and milled and placed in cylindrical, cloth-lined molds to be pressed overnight.The following day they are pressed again before being unmolded and bound in calico (cheesecloth), which allows the cheeses to breathe and mature as they age.The minimum time for aging ranges from six weeks for the smallest wheels to two to ten months for the largest, 62lb. cheeses.The texture of Appleby`s Cheshire is firm, yet moist and flaky. The color of the paste can be either a gentle orange or, in the case of the uncolored cheese, a creamy off-white.Flavors are rich and minerally, with savory vegetal notes of grass, making this a mellow very accessible cheese that pairs very well with a glass of dark ale."

The milk comes from a rare breed of goat that was nearly extinct when cheesemaker Cathy Berthet first started raising goats almost 20 years ago. The Chèvre de Savoie goat is basically a non-standardized version of the French Alpine; while Alpine goats were bred to have several uniform color schemes, these rarer types are gorgeously varied, with diverse splotches of white and beige, black and brown. As the founder of the association to safeguard the breed, Berthet has been working to bring back the Chèvre de Savoie since 2001, increasing the animal population from 326 to over 1,000. The biggest obstacle is in convincing other farmers; with a lack of standardization—and the fact that the race isn’t officially recognized yet by the Ministry of Agriculture—there’s a dearth of data and statistics about the goat, such as the average quantities of milk produced. Often these goats produce milk that’s transformed into cheese alongside milk from standard Alpines, so consumers sometimes eat cheese produced using milk from the endangered animals without knowing it. The goal of the association is to spread awareness about the attempt to bring back the breed and safeguard local diversity. Berthet now produces these medallions along with several other goat’s milk cheeses, which are curdled using a slow lactic coagulation process. Every evening, fresh goat’s milk is channeled into a refrigerated vat, lactic ferments are added and the milk acidifies for 12 hours. The next morning, that milk is mixed with the morning’s fresh milk and rennet is added to promote further coagulation. The mixture is then left for another 24 hours to coagulate before being molded. Berthet also produces chocolate and vanilla crème desserts and yogurts using milk from her herd of Savoie goats.The tiny medallions are fresh yet firm and crumbly, and like other lactic-acid coagulated cheeses, they boldly express their goat’s milk flavor upfront.Perfect for apéro time served alongside a dry, fruity Crépy white wine from the Savoie."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Made from 100% goat’s milk, Chevre au Lait is a gouda style cheese that is aged for a minimum of six months.The body of the cheese is semi-soft with a slightly crumbly texture. Flavors are relatively forward without being overwhelming.This cheese pairs well with Sauvignon Blanc."

Chèvre Noir (Flying Goat),Flying Goat Farm,United States,Maine,,,www.flyinggoatfarmmaine.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,None,Fresh,Flavor added to paste,"Cara Sammons and Devin Shepard produce goat’s milk cheeses out of their home in Acton, Maine, which they describe as an accidental goat dairy. They’d purchased their first goat Grace at the Fryeburg fair in 2007, only so that Cara’s horse wouldn’t be too lonely in the barn. “We just got goat with the most blue ribbons” remembers Devin, “we were just like, we want the one with the floppy ears! And the big nose!” After Cara’s horse Petey passed away in 2008, Grace was devastated, so they got another doe, Ruth, to keep her company. The experience of raising goats, especially kidding, led Cara to change the course of her life; she’s now the husbandry manager of her and Devin’s herd of more than 35. She’s also in veterinary school, conducting research on a poorly understood Nubian goat genetic disease known as the G6S mutation, sampling goat populations throughout New England. Devin, a lover of food and cooking, has become the farmstead cheesemaker after working to convert the basement of the house into a fully operational creamery. Goats are milked twice daily and cheese is made up to several times per week in season. In the future Cara and Devin hope to work with local cow dairies to produce cow’s milk cheeses and blended cheeses year-round. To produce Black Trumpet Chèvre, Devin slices open fresh rounds of cheese and sandwiches in a layer of local black trumpet mushrooms.Appearance is striking with the white, fluffy cheese contrasting against a layer of deep black flakes. The combination of the fresh, mild, slightly tangy and grassy chevre with the fine shreds of savory mushrooms results in a buttery, melt-in-the-mouth harmonious concoction.Pair it with an earthly Burgundy or pinot noir."

Milking a herd of 40-50 American Alpine, French Alpine, and White- Haired Sanaan goats twice a day from March to January, Rawson Brook produces about 300-400 pounds of cheese per week. The cheese has a ‘cult’ recognition on restaurant menus and retail stores in Berkshire County as well as further afield. Susan’s animal husbandry has gained her the utmost respect and recognition and she has helped set a high standard for many neighboring dairy farms and cheese producers. Morning and evening milk is gently pasteurized, then cultures, rennet and salt are added. The curd is then carefully hand- ladled into cheese cloth and left to drain overnight before packaging the following day into plastic containers for sale. The fresh Chevre is sweet, rich and creamy with back notes of fresh thyme and grass finished with a pleasantly mild goat tang. Two flavored chevres are also packaged- thyme with olive oil and chives with garlic. While best eaten alone with fresh bread and a drizzle of olive oil, Rawson Brook chevre is extremely versatile for recipes, both savory and sweet. (Chevre and onion tarts to Chevre cheese cake.)"
Chevremousse,Bongrain / Ile de France,France,,,4.5 oz,www.iledefrancecheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,None,Crème,,"Chevremousse is a soft cow and goat’s milk cheese made by the Bongrain Cheese Company and sold under the company’s Ile de France brand. The history of Bongrain dates back to 1920 in Illoud, France, when Jean- Noel Bongrain, at only 19 years of age, inherited the small family business of Fromagerie d’Illoud (as it was then called). By the early 1950’s, Bongrain began to develop the family business in a new direction, seeking to break away from the traditional French cheeses. Jean- Noel‘s vision was to produce a nationally-branded cheese, an idea that was unheard of at the time in France. He wanted to create recipes that would not only be unique in taste but could be reproduced throughout the various regions of the country. The first cheese to be made along these lines was ‘Caprice des Dieux’, first produced in 1950. Having penetrated the French market, Bongrain then launched further afield, and by 1960 was selling cheese in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Today, Bongrain is France’s second largest cheese and dairy producer and 5th largest in the world. The group currently operates production facilities in 24 counties. Many cheeses are distributed in the United States under the Ile de France brand name. One of Ile de France’s newest cheeses, Chevremousse is inspired by the French mousse de chèvre, a whipped concoction of cream and fresh goat’s cheese that is often used in appetizers and small dishes. Produced using half goat’s cream, Ile de France’s ready-made version has a soft and cloudlike texture. Flavor is satisfying yet mild."
Chevrotin,Various,France,"Savoie, Haute-Savoie",3.5-5 in diameter x 2 in height,9-12 oz,www.chevrotin-aop.fr,Goat,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Small and round, with a dusty pink-colored rind, Chevrotin looks like a smaller Reblochon. And it`sproduced in much the same way as that famous Savoyard washed-rind, in the same region—but instead of cow’s milk, it’s made using the milk of French Alpine goats. The traditional cheese has been made for over 200 years in the mountainous Savoie and Haute-Savoie, but it was mostly consumed within households until a few decades ago when producers began to organize in order to orient it towards the market and toobtain an Appellation d’Origine Protégée, or AOP. Today the total production of Chevrotinremains relatively small at 100 tons per year (to compare, annual production of Reblochon surpasses 15,000 tons per year). According Dominique Joulot, co-owner of the cooperative chèvrerie Ferme des Cabrettes in Sallanches, the small number of Chevrotin producers could be a result of the AOP regulations. The Appellation, which was obtained in 2002, is particularly stringent in its protection of traditional production processes and in ensuring a high standard of quality. In making Chevrotin, the raw goat’s milk is rennet-coagulated, curd is pressed, and small rounds are washed daily for a week in a special brine before being sent to an affineur for further aging on pine boards. Aged for a total minimum of 21 days, this cheese develops a more complex taste over time, its goaty flavors slowly emerging during the maturation. The most well known goat’s milk cheeses are curdled using a lactic coagulation process, which relies on the action of bacteria converting lactose into lactic acid. In these cheeses, goaty flavors emerge immediately. But production of the curd for Chevrotin relies on rennet, resulting in a faster coagulation and a milder initial flavor that needs time to evolve.According to Joulot, the use of goat’s milk is what sets this cheese apart from Reblochon: “goat’s milk is rich in minerals and less fatty, it’s more perfumed. It’s more delicate because the goats eat only the top of the plant, which is the most tender. And that’s reflected in the milk, in the cheese.” A fondant paste that melts in the mouth and a sweet, complex and rounded flavor: Chevrotin is eminently likeable. Acidity is low enough and the buildup of goaty pungency is subtle enough to satisfy washed-rind diehards and skeptics alike.Joulot suggests pairing Chevrotin with a dry, fruity white wine from the Savoie: a Chignin or a Crépy."

Since 1987, the Dairy has been owned and operated by Stella Bennett and her son Joe.All the cheeses produced by Stella and Joe are handmade from raw goat’s milk sourced from their 220 milking does that are a cross of Saanen and Toggenburg breeds. The goats are fed hay that is grown on the farm without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. As soon as the goats are milked, the milk is transferred directly over to the cheese room for cheesemaking.Chilcote is a brick-shaped cheese inspired by French cheese-making techniques. The maturation process of 3 to 4 weeks takes place in aging rooms that are monitored constantly to ensure that the cheese develops its wrinkled geotricum rind. Contained immediately beneath the outer, thin rind is a layer of soft, unctuous paste that ends abruptly where it meets the true interior paste.The interior has a dense, fudgy consistency with a velvety texture on the tongue.   Flavors are grassy and savory flavors with a nice amount of tang.Like most goat’s milk cheeses, Chilcote pairs very well with bright citrusy wines like Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. However, for those who prefer a beverage other than wine, this cheese also pairs nicely with green tea. With it’s citrus tang and dense consistency, Chilcote is wonderful in green salads, and for those who love to grill, this cheese it grills up nicely and can be served as a great contrast to grilled vegetables."

Milk for production is sourced from a handful of local dairies that belong to the Obere Mühle co-operative. Extremely high standards of milk quality are mandated since the same milk is also used by Arturo for production of his traditional mountain cheeses. Blue mold cultures are added to the fresh milk as its heated in the vat at the creamery. The cheese is formed into wheels weighing between five and six pounds that, after approximately one week, are pierced to allow air into the interior of the cheese and the blue veins of mold to develop. Cheeses are matured for at least two months before release.Despite the original recipe being modeled on Roquefort, Chiriboga Blue differs quite markedly in that it has a creamier mouthfeel and denser texture.

Ciabot,Cora,Italy,Piedmont,"4 ins diameter, 1 in high",7oz,,SheepCow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Piedmont, which lies in the Alpine foothills of Italy’s northwest region, has long been renowned for its production of food and wine. Here, in an area known as the Langhe in the province of Cuneo, the Cora family produce a range of Robiola cheeses made primarily from goat’s or sheep’s milk. Depending on seasonal availability, sometimes cow`s milk is blended with the other milks. The cheesemaking business was established in 2000 by Gianni and Paola Cora. Although the couple had previous careers, they are both passionately interested in preserving traditional local foods and after Gianni spent some time training with local cheesemakers, decided to launch their own business. Production of cheese at Cora is now very much a family affair as Gianni and Paola have been joined by their daughter Lorena and son Francesco in the tiny dairy. Cheeses are made in small batches between February and November each year. To form the curd, starter cultures are added to the milk which is then left alone for 36 hours. During this time, the cultures work very slowly to form a fragile curd, known as a lactic acid set. At the end of the process, a very small amount of rennet is added to give the curd a little strength and, once fully formed, it is ladled incredibly gently into the molds to preserve as much integrity and moisture as possible in the finished cheese. Made from a blend of sheep`s and cow`s milk, Ciabot is very similar to a classic two milk Robiola or the French Perail. Cheeses weigh about 7oz, and are encased in a delicate rind that is ivory in color. The interior paste is smooth, yielding and runny in texture when ripe. Flavors are mild and very accessible with sweet, rich, earthy notes associated with sheep`s milk, balanced by the buttery qualities of the cow`s milk."

Made from sheep’s milk to a Pecorino recipe, the production of Cinerino is inextricably linked to the local traditions of Castelcivita, a small village on the slopes of the Alburni Hills. In Castelcivita, the arrival of summer is marked each year on 13th June with the Feast of St Anthony, when the celebrations include the lighting of bonfires made from fragrant myrtle branches. Moreover, after the festival, the ash from the fires is saved and used to coat the rinds of the young cheeses. The ash helps to preserve and develop the rind, as well as protect the cheese during their unusual aging process. Cheeses are matured in containers that are placed in underground trenches known as Hallows, for between 3-6 months prior to release. The texture of Cinerinio is firm and slightly flaky with an interior paste of a bone white color. In terms of flavor, the cheeses take on the smoke and wood characteristics of the myrtle ash, underpinned by grassy, lactic notes from the milk."
Cirrus,Mt Townsend Creamery,United States,Washington,"3 ins diameter, 1 in high",5 oz,www.mttownsendcreamery.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Founded in 2005 by Matt Day and Ryan Trail, Mt Townsend Creamery is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Port Townsend, WA. Having had a successful tenure at the New Belgium Brewery as a process engineer, Ryan started to become interested in cheesemaking. Together with his friend Matt, Ryan began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After 2 years Will decided to pursue other interests and Matt and Ryan assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing Marketing, Sales and general business issues. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsular’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses all made from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a 275 cow dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Named after the white clouds that hang over the Northwest Olympic Mountains, Cirrus was one of the first cheeses made by Mt Townsend. Similar in style to a Camembert, but with a slightly more dense texture, the cheese is produced using a partial lactic coagulation process.After pasteurization, the milk is cultured and allowed to acidify naturally before the rennet is added. After coagulation, the curd is cut and carefully transferred to the cheese molds where its allowed to drain naturally.After unmolding, the young cheeses are transferred to a drying room where they’re left overnight. This helps to wick away moisture from the surface and aids in the development of the rind. The following day, the cheeses are dry-salted and moved to a ripening room where they will remain for about eight days. At this point the cheeses are wrapped and aged for a further three or four weeks before release.Cirrus has a semi-soft, fudge-like texture and ivory-colored interior paste with a white bloomy exterior rind.Aromas are of mushrooms and earth with distinct flavors of cream and salt."
Citrus Ginger BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14 in diameter x 4 in height,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavor Added,Cheddar-likeGrana / Grating cheese,Flavor added to rind,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin.  Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing. This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings; in this case, a blend that includes citrus, ginger and sesame.Exuding aromas of sesame, Citrus Ginger BellaVitano has a colorful orange and black-speckled rind surrounding a smooth, light milky-colored paste. On the palate an initial kick of spice subsides as citrus flavors grow, and the sweet-salty balance and umami flavors remind us a bit of beef jerky. Citrus and ginger flavors, while pronounced closer to the rind, generally play a background role in this cheese. Onion and tomato flavors are surprisingly detectable in the coating, contributing a salsa-like aroma.Pair Citrus Ginger BellaVitano with a light red wine, a Chardonnay or a Prosecco. For beer pairings, try it with a wheat beer, a cider or a pilsner."
Classic Blue Log,Westfield Farm,United States,Massachusetts,5.5 inches long. 2 ins diameter,5-6 oz,www.chevre.com,Goat,Pasteurised,BlueSoft,Vegetable,Mold RipenedBlue,,,"This little log is a stellar example of a growing niche in the cheese industry:the externally-rinded blue.  Some say the style itself was invented at Westfield Farm in Massachusetts, originally owned by Bob and Lettie Kilmoyer. The self-taught cheesemaking couple had a penchant for experimentation, and decided to usePenicillium roqueforti—the mold that gives classic blues its inside veins—to colonize only the rind of their fresh chèvre. While initially confronted with skepticism, the style caught on, and was eventually granted its own American Cheese Society Judging & Competition category. Soon after, Westfield`s externally-rinded blues began winning scads of awards. Since 1996, Bob and Debby Stetson have run Westfield Farm, continuing production of its originals and expanding the cow`s and goat`s milk cheese repertoire. Blue Log is Westfield Farm`s classic surface-ripened blue goat`s milk cheese.To make it, freshly-formed chèvre curds are inoculated with thePenicillium roquefortimold. They`re then formed into log shapes andtransferred to a maturing room where they age for about two weeks, losing some moisture and developing an exterior covering of blue mold. Unlike traditional blues, which are pierced so that oxygen flows into the cheese and promotes blue mold growth, these logs are soft and compact, discouraging the growth of mold in the paste.The interior paste is moist and fluffy, and bone-white in color. Visually, when cut in a cross section, you can see the disc of white encircled by a ring of blue.Flavors are milky, clean, and bright with citrus notes and an earthy, piquant tang from the blue mold.Smear hunks of Blue Log on slices of dried pear for a mouthful that balances sweetness and tang."

Originally from New Zealand, both Jean and Linnea were raised on farms. They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into the property in Maine that had belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Kennebec Cheesery’s classic and most popular chèvre comes in two ways: in small rounds or in cubes marinated in olive oil. To produce the fresh cheese, milk is heat-treated and cooled down to 75-80 degrees before culture and rennet are added. The inoculated milk then sits for 24 hours as the curd forms. The following day, curd is scooped into molds, where it sits for another two days, being flipped periodically, then is salted and moved to the refrigerator. Finally, on the fifth day, rounds are rolled in herbs, such as a mixture of Herbes de Provence (other versions include Classic, Dill, and Cracked Peppercorn). Kennebec Cheesery Chèvre is smooth, creamy and lightly salted, with a fantastic spreadable texture. Herbed coatings are thick and potent, the cheese thus lending itself well to pairing with bread or crackers."
Clochette,Chevrechard,France,Poitou-Charantes,"3 ins high, 2.5 ins diameter",7oz,,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"The name reflects this cheese`s somewhat dramatic shape, since ""Clochette"" translates as ""little bell"". Made in the Poitou-Charantes region of France, the majority of Clochette is produced from pasteurized goats milk by cheesemakers Chevrechard, although some raw milk versions may be available locally in France. Chevrechard is known for making goats milk cheeses - including the famous Chabichou -within the Poitou-Charantes region, an area long associated with their production. Clochette is produced seasonally from late March through until autumn, which is typically in sync with the goats` milking season. After production, cheeses are matured for a minumum of two weeks before release. Aromas are of hay, grass and cellar with a pleasant smell of goats. The interior texture is fine and smooth, becoming firmer and slightly drier with age. The rind is ivory in color with a gently wrinkled appearance. Clochette pairs especially well with a dry, crisp white wine such as Sancerre or a medium bodied red such as a Rhone or Pinot Noir."

Cloumage,Shy Brothers Farm,United States,Massachusetts,Varies,8 oz or 3 lbs,www.shybrothersfarm.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,None,,,"Shy Brothers Farm, located at the eastern tip of Massachusetts, is owned by the Santos brothers, two sets of fraternal twins who are third generation dairy farmers. The farm is situated directly between the confluence of two rivers and close to the Atlantic coast. The climate is relatively temperate due to the Gulf Stream and also affected by the salt air – both factors that impact the grass which in turn affects the flavor of the milk and the cheese. Named for the brothers’ shy nature, the farm is also home to 120 milking cows that consist of three different breeds; Holstein, Ayrshire and Jersey. In recent years the brothers have been introducing more Ayrshire genetics into the mix since Ayrshire milk is ideal for cheesemaking. The four brothers all share most of the jobs on the farm with Karl taking responsibility for the cheesemaking. After many years of dairy farming and having produced milk that was sold on the open market, in 2006 the Santos brothers found they we no longer able to make a living due to falling milk prices. Having looked at various ways to add value to the milk, they hit upon the idea of making cheese. Karl attended a weekend cheesemaking class in New Hampshire, a course at the Vermont Institute of Artisanal Cheese and made a two week trip to France to visit various cheesemakers. It was while he was in the Bugundy region that he was introduced to the recipe for making the tiny, thimble-sized cheeses that is now the signature cheese called Hannahbells. In addition, Kevin also produces a fresh artisanal curd cheese called Cloumage. Based on a French recipe, this style of cheese is an everyday staple in France – especially used in cooking. For production, the curd is formed using a long, slow acidfication process and is allowed to drain naturally under its own weight.The texture of Cloumage is light and fluffy.  Flavors are fresh and citrus-like with a mild but definite tang.   Cloumage is extremely versatile to cook with as an ingredient, such as for stuffing a turkey or chicken or with horseradish for salmon or roast beef. Equally, it can simply be eaten with honey or pepper."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.Cocoa Cardona is made to an original receipe created by Sid Cook himself. After production, cheeses are rubbed with a blend of vegetable oil, cracked black pepper, and cocoa in order to help develop a rind and protect them during the aging process.The interior of the cheese is a pale straw color, offset by the dark-colored cocoa rind.

Coeur de Neufchâtel,Various,France,Haute Normandie,"4 ins diameter, 1 in high",8oz,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Neufchâtel is produced in Haute Normandie, in the area around the village of Neufchâtel-en-Bray. Made from cow`s milk, its one of France`s oldest established cheeses with production reputedly dating back as far as 1035. One of the reasons for the cheese`s consistent popularity is that the town of Neufchâtel-en-Bray is located only 82 miles from the markets of Paris. It was also mentioned in early guides and almanacs for gourmands. Neufchâtel comes in six different shapes and sizes; ""bonde and double bonde"" - large and small cylinders, ""carre"" - a square, ""briquette"" a small ingot or brick shape and ""coeur"" and ""grand coeur"" small and large hearts. The heart shape is said to have originated during the Hundred Years War (14th & 15th centuries) when English soldiers were stationed in Normandie. The French farm girls, all of whom made cheese, fell in love with them and started making heart-shaped cheeses. The recipe for production of the cheese, regardless of shape, was granted AOC status in 1969 and is consequently protected. Production can be industrial, farmstead or artisanal. Milk for production comes exclusively from the Normandie breed of cow, an animal whose milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. This reflects a 2007 change to the AOC rules and some dairies are still in transition, still using milk from other breeds such as Montbeliard. For artisanal production, fresh, warm milk is transferred straight from the milking parlor to the cheesemaking room. The milk is heated and rennet added two hours later. After the curds are formed and cut, they are transferred to cotton bags and allowed to drain under their own weight for several hours. The bags are then placed in a press in order to extract as much whey as possible - it is this process that differentiates Neufchâtel from other Normandy cheeses. The result of this pressing is that the paste of the cheese is more grainy and thicker instead of the wet, tender curds that associated with, for instance, the production of Camembert. Traditionally, after the curds are removed from the bags, the cheeses are salted by hand. However, many cheesemakers are now adding the salt to the curd in order to achieve a more consistent and less salty end result. A light sprinkling of Penicilium Candidum is also added to the mix, in order to give the cheeses a jump start with the development of the white bloomy mold that grows on the exterior. Once shaped, the cheeses are transferred to a temperature-controlled cave and on the fourth day, turned (flipped) in order to maintain an even distribution of moisture and mold development. Maturation takes a minimum of ten days before the cheeses are released although many cheeses are aged for longer with the result that the interior becomes less chalky in consistency. The exterior rind is white and velvety. Flavors are mushroomy, rich and slightly yeasty, depending on age."

Birgit, who is originally from Germany, has a background in Food Science and Robert was the Fermentation Manager at the brewery. In 2000, after some experimental cheesemaking at home, Birgit enlisted the help of her father, Franz, a master cheesemaker from Germany. Today, MouCo Cheese Company produces four types of soft cheese: MouCo Camembert, ColoRouge, Ashley and Truffello. Pasteurized milk, predominantly from Holstein cows, is sourced from Morning Fresh Dairy, located just outside Fort Collins. For production of the ColoRouge, the milk is heated and the cultures and rennet added. After coagulation, the curd is carefully ladled into molds to preserve as much moisture as possible, and allowed to drain. After a few hours, the cheeses are unmolded and salted which helps to kick-start the development of the rind. The young cheeses are then transferred to racks and dried slightly before being moved to the maturing cave. During this time, the cheeses are regularly washed with a culture called Bacterium Linens. This causes a white and orange-red mold to develop on the exterior of the cheese and also gives the cheeses a slightly pungent aroma. After a period of about two weeks the cheeses are ready to be released. The texture of ColoRouge is soft, creamy and yielding.

Comeback Cow,Dorothy’s,USA,Illinois,,7 oz,dorothyscheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Hidden inside Comeback Cow’s orange rind is an intensely soft paste with faint aromas of cream and mushroom.  Dorothy’s in Lena, Illinois was born from the legacy of Dorothy Demeter, a passionate farm girl who fell in love with her grandfather’s Illinois creamery and became the first woman to earn a degree in Dairy Science from Iowa State University. Demeter started her career at the family creamery after it turned into Kolb-Lena Cheese. Demeter’s cheesy love story and innovation live on today through Dorothy’s, where her son, nephew, and former apprentice still work tirelessly to make cheese inspired by her experience.  Dorothy’s soft-ripened cheeses are made with cow’s milk from surrounding farms and proprietary cultures. They are then hand-wrapped to resemble freshly sprung flowers, inspired by blossoms found in the nearby Apple River Canyon.   The fragrant Comeback Cow is one of two varieties currently offered by Dorothy’s. The bloomy rind is tinged orange with age and annatto, a food dye derived from seeds of the achiote tree.Within its thick rind, the mild and soft paste smells and tastes of cream and mushrooms. Put simply, imagine having a savory marshmallow in your mouth.Enjoy alongside some fresh apples or pears. For wine pairings, consider a Bourgogne or cabernet."
Comté,Various,France,Franche-Comte,30 in diam x 6 in height,80-90 lbs,www.comte-usa.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Made from raw cow`s milk exclusively in the Jura Mountain region of France, Comté has been produced for over eight centuries. Consumed by at least 50% of the population, it is also France`s most popular PDO cheese.  To keep up with this demand, Comté is produced in very substantial quantities by approximately 160 co-operatives, known as ""fruitieres.” The vast majority of the milk for production comes from the Montbéliarde breed cows, while the remaining milk is drawn from the French Simmenthal. The cows reside on nearly three thousand different farms and dairies in the mountains. Milk is delivered daily to the fruitieres, and it takes over 100 gallons of milk (the daily output of about 20 cows) to make one 80-90 lb. wheel of Comté.  Great importance is attached to the starter cultures for Comté. The majority of producers use cultures that are related to local flora.  After production, the young cheeses are transferred to one of 16 different affineurs (cheese maturers), all of whom are Comté specialists. Together, they mature about 60,000 metric tons of cheese a year.  Wheels are matured for a minimum of four months from the date of production. Older iterations generally are aged six to eighteen months or even longer. Temperature and humidity levels differ between different affineurs, according to the needs of specific wheels. The cheese is regularly rubbed with brine to help develop the rind.  The production and affinage (maturation) of Comté are governed by AOC (name protected) regulations that came into effect in 1958, and both must take place within the AOC specified areas. Comté was one of the first cheeses to be granted an AOC in France. The texture of Comté is smooth and dense, only rarely exhibiting small holes. The color of the cheese is determined by the season in which it was produced; Comté produced in warmer months, when the cows are on pasture, will be more yellow in appearance, while Comté produced in cold months, when cows are fed locally harvested hay, will be paler.   Maturation also affects the flavor of Comté. Typically speaking, a younger aged Comté will have more delicate, sweeter flavors, while a older aged Comté will exhibit one or two highly pronounced flavors as well as a higher number of amino acid crystals, giving it a slight crunch.  Flavors are very rich and famously complex, and vary according to the fruitière. It is not unusual to taste butter, chocolate, toast, fudge, hazelnuts, plums, pepper or even leather in the cheeses.Comté is a great match forthe white wines of theJura, with their aromas of driedfruit and spices. It can also be paired with a variety of other dry whitewines, young reds, and Champagne."

Just five miles away are the ruins of a pre-Civil War fluid milk dairy that had been owned by the Condor family. Though that landmark has seen better days, Condor’s Ruin clearly has a bright future. Similar to a French Valençay cheese in its recipe and appearance, pyramid-shaped Condor’s Ruin has an ash coating beneath its white mold exterior. But unlike Valençay, which is made with goat’s milk, Condor’s Ruin is made using the milk from Manyfold Farm’s sheep flock. Aged from three to six weeks, the cheese is available only from February until October, so that the ewes have a few months to rest.Velvety, dense, and rich Condor’s Ruin has a slightly chalky center and a gooey creamline beneath its ashed and mold-ripened rind. Flavor is salty and lactic, with notes of flowers, grass, thistle, and garlic rounding out the profile, reflecting the milk from the sheeps’ grass-only diet.Pair Condor’s Ruin with hot sopressata, or with pear jam to bring fruit to the cream. For drink pairings, try it with a dry white wine."
Constant Bliss,Jasper Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,"3 ins high, 2 ins diameter",7 oz, www.jasperhillfarm.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Located in the beautiful, rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont, Jasper Hill Farm was bought by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler in 1998. When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 45 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, which comprise of 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of several other Vermont based producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Harbison, Moses Sleeper and Winnimere.Named after a historic local pioneer scout, Constant Bliss is a small, mold ripened cheese of complexity and depth.The curds are predominantly lactic and are carefully hand-ladled into the forms to retain as much moisture as possible. After draining, the cheeses are hand salted and turned every day for the first 30 days.Constant Bliss has a rich, full and balanced flavor, that is more often associated with triple crème cheeses. There are tangible notes of mushrooms, cellar and butter that linger on the palate.The interior paste is a buttery-yellow, becoming slightly translucent under the rind as the cheese matures."
Coolea,Dickie Willems,Ireland,Co Cork,12 in diameter x 4 in height,17.5 lbs,cooleacheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Hard,Animal,Plastic,Gouda-like,,"This Irish twist on gouda is the creation of Helene and Dick Willems, both natives of the Netherlands, who moved to a small farm in Southern Ireland. They decided to start making cheese in 1979, using the milk from their own herd of cows. The cheese is named after the local village, Cúil Aodha (anglicized as Coolea), but is based on a Dutch recipe.  Production of Coolea closely follows that of traditional gouda. Milk is heated and a starter culture and rennet are added. After coagulation, the curd is cut and the whey is drained off, at which point the curds are washed, (water is added to the cheese vat) to slow down the acidification of the cheese and reheated to expel more moisture. The curds are then packed into molds and pressed for six hours. The cheese is then placed in a salt brine and painted with wax. Coolea ripens for a minimum of four months and is sold at various levels of maturity, all the way up to a year and a half.   Over the years, demand and production have grown steadily, and in 1987 a completely new and expanded cheese plant was built. Willems’ son, also named Dick, joined the cheesemaking team in 1991, becoming the head cheesemaker in 1998.The texture of Coolea is very firm and dense, with occasional holes. The color of the interior paste is a deep, rich, golden caramel. Not as assertive as many tangy goudas, flavors are rich, sweet, smooth and complex. There are distinct notes of butterscotch, grass, endive, chocolate and even toasted brioche.Coolea is a beer-friendly cheese. Pair it with a rich pale ale or a blonde ale. If you`re able to find them, spring for Irish selections: Thwaites` Wainwright or Eight Degrees` Howling Pale Ale."
Cooleeney,Cooleeney Farmhouse Cheese,Ireland,Co. Tipperary,"10 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",3.5-4lbs,www.cooleeney.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,,,"Cooleeney Farm, Located near Thurles in Co. Tipperary, Ireland, is home to the Maher family, fourth generation dairy farmers and their herd of pedigree Friesian cows. There is a long history of quality milk production here, with their first award for milk having been presented in 1905. Breda and Jim Maher together with their son Pat started their cheesemaking operation in 1986. The rich, peaty Tipperary pasture is among the best in the world and ideal for producing artisanal cheeses. As with so many other dairying families in Ireland, part of the spur for getting into cheese production was the introduction of European milk quotas in 1984. The quotas effectively meant that the Mahers were forced to find a way of adding value to their milk. Breda, who already had a degree in hotel management, took a course in cheesemaking at the University of Cork and also gained experience at Ryefield Farm in Cavan. The first stage of the Maher’s cheesemaking plant was completed in 1989. In 1999, the family also purchased the Dublin-based Dúnbarra cheese company, effectively adding several more sales channels. In 2000, Cooleeney also added goat’s milk cheeses to their production range. Made in the style of a brie, the Maher’s orignal cheese however, was the eponymously named Cooleeney. For production, each morning, milk is pumped from the milking parlor over to the cheesemaking room and into the vats. There, starter cultures are added followed by the rennet. The resulting curds are carefully transferred into molds for draining, which takes place in a temperature controlled room over the course of twenty four hours. The following day, the young cheeses are brined and transferred to maturing rooms, where they are turned on a regular basis to allow for the even distribution of moisture and mold development. Cheeses are left to mature for between eight to ten weeks prior to release.With a soft, yielding texture, flavors of Cooleeney are rich with hints of oak and mushrooms that intensify with age."

The basis for the recipe dates back to the 13th century, and is a combination of the Caerphilly and Wensleydale cheese processes. The addition of nettles was introduced in 1983, as was the cheese`s name, which was a riff on Alan Gray, its creator and first cheesemaker.Fresh nettles are collected during May from the hedgerows surrounding the dairy. The leaves are either steamed or frozen (which removes the sting) and are applied to the Yargs when they are two days old. It takes about ten minutes for an experienced worker to nettle a cheese; they dip each leaf in a sterilizing solution and apply them in concentric circles around the cheese.Cheeses are then transferred to maturing rooms, where eventually mold grows over the nettles during the four to eight weeks of aging.The texture of Cornish Yarg is firm and slightly crumbly, with occasional holes or slits.Flavors are clean and lactic, with sweet, delicate notes of mushrooms, earth and cellar, accompanied by a pleasant tang."
Cotherstone,Quarryhouse Farm,United Kingdom,Durham,"8 ins diameter,  4 ins high",6-7 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Cotherstone, made in Co. Durham in the north of England, is one of only a handful of traditional types of Dales (valley) cheese still in existence. Joan Cross, its last remaining producer has been making the cheese at Quarryhouse farm for over 30 years. Named after a local village, Cotherstone is related to Wensleydale as well as the lesser known Swaledale. The scale and type of farming in this area of the Dales is not suited to large dairy herds, and traditionally cheese production was always small-scale, with milk coming from the farm`s own small number of cows. The cheese was often produced in the kitchen as part of the daily routine, primarily for home consumption and consequently the “make” had to fit in around the daily chores on the farm. Joan Cross learned the recipe from her mother. Although there have been a few changes over the years, namely with the starter culture, advent of pasteurization, and the use of vegetarian rennet, the basic cheese recipe remains similar to when her mother used to make it. Traditionally, no starter culture was used. Instead, milk was allowed to sour naturally overnight in a milk can that was kept at the correct incubation temperature by placing a container of hot water into the milk, and covering the can with heavy coats or blankets to insulate it. Things have moved on a bit since then. Joan now makes cheese in a vat with occasional help from her two sons, and milk for production is sourced locally. The traditional season for making Cotherstone was from May through to the first frost in the autumn, however today the Crosses make it almost year round. Cotherstone seems to embody several different textures at once, which is perhaps partly why it is so delicious. Although moist, the texture is unmistakably crumbly and dense and yet light at the same time. Locally it is eaten as a fresh cheese, at two to three weeks old, but away from the immediate vicinity of County Durham, it is most likely encountered as an aged cheese, at which point it develops a delicate natural rind. Even then, the cheese is dominated by the fresh citric flavors of soured milk. Flavors are deliciously bright and lemony with notes of earth and cellar. It`s excellent with oatcakes or next to a bowl of hot oatmeal for breakfast. Put it out with a pint of stout before dinner. Or eat it for a snack, as part of a Ploughman`s lunch with a bit of pâté, pickled onions and country bread."

Eventually they struck gold in a very remote, mountainous region of central Mexico, along the border of what is now Michoacán and Jalisco. Due to the remote geography and because mountains are not the easiest place to grow crops, the Spaniards depended heavily on their cows, and cheese made up a large part of both their diet and income.Although Cotija is now made industrially all over Mexico, there is a great difference between the industrial cheese and that which comes from the mountains, where it is still made on a small scale by about 90 cheesemakers, who work seasonally with raw milk from cows grazing on mountain grass. The season runs from July to October (rainy season), when humidity is high enough to mature the cheese without cracking.When the rain stops and the temperature rises, the wheels are transferred to cool, aging cellars. where the 37lb. wheels of Queso Cotija de Montaña (mountain Cotija) receive at least seven months of aging.Since Cotija was largely devised to be preserved and aged in an era that pre-dated refrigeration, it is a very highly salted cheese.The texture is dense, close and crumbly. The rind is quite thin and the paste of the cheese pale ivory in color.Cotija can have a pronounced sour-milk aroma and an assertive bite overlaid with salt. However, good cheeses are balanced with a lactic tang that is pleasant in the mouth."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883.  Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.  Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows.

Errico comes from a family of cheese makers who have been producing Provolone in Italy for over a century. In 1979, he moved his family to the United States and opened his own Italian cheese company. Over the last thirty years, BelGioioso has grown to include seven manufacturing facilities in Northeastern Wisconsin. Using the milk of Wisconsin dairy farmers, the company produces over 25 types of cheese. However, each facility produces only a select few of these cheeses, thereby ensuring high quality and consistency. This has resulted in multiple awards, including several United States, World and American Cheese Society Awards. CreamyGorg is BelGoioso’s creative blend of two distinct styles of Gorgonzola from Italy; Dolce Latte and Malghese. It is a pasteurized cow’s milk cheese with dark blue to green veining throughout the wheel, which is made using a traditional recipe. It is aged for 90 days, which ensures that the cheese is dense enough to maintain its shape, but with a rich and moist texture. The flavor of CreamyGorg is earthy with tangy veins of blue. It is always great to pair this cheese with a dry Rose or a Brut Sparkling Wine with just a touch of sweetness. CreamyGorg works particularly well when used in sauces or crumbled over steaks."
Crema de Blue,Valley Shepherd Creamery,United States,New Jersey,"6 - 7 ins diameter, 2-3 ins high",2.5 lbs,www.valleyshepherd.com,SheepCow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Located in Long Valley, New Jersey, Valley Shepherd Creamery is owned and operated by Eran Wajswol (pronounced why-soul). Eran and his wife both have a background in engineering as well as a keen interest in farming. After initially trying their hand as lamb meat producers, both became fascinated by cheese and cheesemaking during frequent trips to Europe.  This inspired them to purchase a flock of Dutch Frieisian dairy sheep and experiment with making a Pyrenees-style, cave aged sheeps milk cheese. More European trips to visit cheesemakers followed, and all the while Eran honed and refined his cheesemaking skills. Eventually the cheese reached the point where Eran was satisfied enough to release his first cheese, Oldwick Shepherd, named after their local village. Today, the farm at Valley Shepherd is home to over 600 East Friesland and Lacaune sheep together with approximately 100 Alpine, Nubian and mixed breed goats and 50 Jersey and Guernsey cows. The different milk types allow Eran and his lead cheesemaker, Jeanine Dargis, to make a great variety of styles of cheese - approximately 25-30 different types are aging in the maturing caves at any one time. The cheese cave, which was created by blasting the side out of a rocky hill and then covering it back up with earth after construction, houses four aging rooms. Each temperature controlled room is designed for optimum aging of a different style of cheese. All Valley Shepherd’s aged cheeses are made from raw milk and traditional rennet. Production of Crema de Blue involves several unique processes. One of these is that after the curd is formed, it is stirred entirely by hand, in the vat for approximately three hours before being transferred into the molds. According to Wajswol, this labor-intensive stirring holds the key to the cheese’s light texture. The stirring is always done either by Wajswol himself or his head cheesemaker Jeanine Dargis. Finished wheels are wrapped in foil for thirty days and placed in the aging cave to mature. At this point, the foil is removed and the blue mold allowed to develop fully, creating the soft blue-green veining present in the finished cheese.Initial flavors of flint and liquorice evolve into more savory, vegetal notes and finish with a spicy kick of white pepper."

Twenty something yars later in 1993, Sue sold her part of the business in order to form Tomales Bay Foods, a business designed to provide a marketing outlet for local agricultural food products in Marin County. Discovering that her new company was fulfiling a tremendous need and niche, Sue asked Peggy to join her in launching a greatly expanded business, including a permanent farm-market type store selling locally made food products and a cheesemaking operation. The cheesemaking business and retail stores became known as Cowgirl Creamery. The business flourished, and it quickly became clear that the cheese retail, wholesale and cheese making operations were the most successful. Today, Cowgirl Creamery has additional retail stores in San Francisco and Washington DC together with a much larger cheesemaking operation and warehouse based in Petaluma, CA. Cowgirl Creamery, under the guidance of head cheesemaker Maureen Cunnie, produces a range of fresh and mold ripened cheeses using organic cow`s milk from small local dairies.

After initially focusing on lamb production, the Callahans were encouraged to develop their sheep into a milking herd. This, combined with a trip to Italy where they had the opportunity to taste many local sheep`s milk cheeses inspired them to start to experiment with cheesemaking. The sheep at Bellwether Farm consist mainly of East Friesian ewes. The ewes give birth to between one and three lambs each year and the lambs stay with their mother for 45 days before the ewe joins the milking line. Each ewe gives, on average, slightly less than one gallon a day and they are milked for eight months before the cycle begins again. The sheep graze freely year round in addition to being given grain and alfalfa as necessary. Cindy`s Callahan son Liam oversees cheese production while his wife Diana manages the office and Cindy focuses on taking care of the sheep. In addition to making a range of sheep`s milk cheeses, the Callahans also buy in local Jersey cow`s milk in order to make a range of cow`s milk cheeses. Renowned for its rich, buttery characteristics, Jersey milk has a higher fat and protein content than most milks, which gives the cheeses a wonderfully rich, balanced flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Based on an Italian straccino recipe, Crescenza is is a very soft cheese with no rind, that is almost like a cross between mozzarella and butter.

Crescenza Stracchino is a fresh, pasteurized cow’s milk cheese modeled after Stracchino; an Italian cheese from the Piedmont region.

While the cows whose milk is used to produce Crescenza Stracchino aren’t as tired as their Italian counterparts, the character of the cheese is similar. It has a rich, dense texture half way between a cream cheese and Mozzarella. The flavor is bright and clean with lactic and tangy qualities. Enjoy it quickly, since this cheese has a relatively short lifespan of just two months. Since this cheese is pretty simple cheese, it is best to pair it with clean, fresh, young wines such as Vinho Verde or Pinot Grigio.

The history of Bongrain dates back to 1920 in Illoud, France, when Jean-Noel Bongrain, at only 19 years of age, inherited the small family business of Fromagerie d’Illoud (as it was then called). By the early 1950’s, Bongrain began to develop the family business in a new direction, seeking to break away from the traditional French cheeses. Jean- Noel‘s vision was to produce a nationally-branded cheese, an idea that was unheard of at the time in France. He wanted to create recipes that would not only be unique in taste but could be reproduced throughout the various regions of the country. The first cheese to be made along these lines was ‘Caprice des Dieux’, first produced in 1950. Having penetrated the French market, Bongrain then launched further afield, and by 1960 was selling cheese in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Today, Bongrain is France’s second largest cheese and dairy producer and 5th largest in the world. The group currently operates production facilities in 24 counties. Many cheeses are distributed in the United States under the Ile de France brand name. One of Ile de France’s newest cheeses, Crème de Bleu is made using cow’s milk collected daily in the mountainous Auvergne region of France. Perhaps inspired by the local “sauce au bleu d’Auvergne”, which often tops meat dishes, Crème de Bleu has a smooth, shiny, liquidy texture. It works well as a dip or as a spread for sandwiches. Taste is reminiscent of a blue cheese, yet milder and lacking any overpowering tang."

While Grubbdidn’t originally intend to carry on his parents’ tradition of farming, his father’s premature death in 1978 wrested him out of his career at the Irish agricultural research institute. In 1979, Grubb transformed the 120-acre mixed Beechmount Farm into a dairy farm, establishing a herd of 90 Friesian cows, but he quickly became disillusioned with churning out high volumes of milk. To make things more interesting—and profitable—Louis decided to turn to cheesemaking. Enter Jane Grubb, Louis’s wife. A trained chef, she devoured cheesemaking courses run by Veronica Steele, a pioneer of modern Irish farmhouse cheese. Soon, noting that Danish Blue was being imported into Ireland, she suggested the farm develop an Irish version and corner the market, creating the famous Cashel Blue. Later, she decided to make a variation from sheep`s milk, which became Crozier Blue. Launched in 1992, Crozier Blue remains the only blue cheep’s milk cheese made in Ireland. Milk for production is sourced from a flock of over 500 sheep at a nearby farm in Ballinamona, which is helmed by two young farmers Michael Crosse and PJ Pollard.Crozier Blue has a full, sweet, rich and cream-like mouth feel, with notes of salt and toasted nuts. The interior paste is shot through with gentle blue veining and has a moist, yielding texture encased by a natural rind.Crozier Blue`s piquancy amplifies the hoppiness of an IPA, but it can also be subdued and balanced by a creamy stout."

Cheeses are made from either goat`s or cow`s milk. When makingCrumbled Goat Cheese, goat`smilk is pasteurized and starter cultures are added. After an overnight lactic coagulation, the fresh curd is allowed to drain in cheesecloth at a cold temperature. When the curd reaches the desired texture, it’s crumbled by hand and mixed with a combination of dried fruit and herbs.The smooth, creamy, mild crumbles are produced in a range of flavor combinations. These include apricot and thyme (creamy, tangy, and slightly sweet), cranberry and tarragon (balanced, sweet, and tart with just the right amount of spice), and tomato and basil (tart and smoky with a strong flavor of sun-dried tomatoes). The crumbles are ideal for sprinkling on salads, steamed vegetables, pasta dishes, or flatbreads."
Cumberland,Sequatchie Cove Farm,United States,Tennessee,10 in diameter x 4 in height,3-4 lbs,www.sequatchiecovefarm.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,," Set in the shade of the Cumberland Plateau outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, Sequatchie Cove Creamery is a family-run business owned and operated by Nathan and Padgett Arnold and a small team of devoted turophiles. The focus here is on expressing the local southeastern Tennessee terroir, as well assustainability; the100% solar-powered creamery`s most substantial waste product, whey, is fed back to the farm`s livestock. Cheese is made at Sequatchie Cove every day using fresh raw cow`s milk produced on the 300-acre farm.Dairy and herd manager Randall Tomlinson tends to an 80-plus head herd of dairy cows, predominantly Jersey and Jersey-Holstein crosses. As cows forage, Tomlinson and his crew busily oversee pasture health, milk quality, genetics, on-farm breeding, calving, and milking equipment. Inspired by the classic French Tomme de Savoie, Cumberland is aged 75-90 days. Like their French predecessors, wheels of the cheese are not washed during aging, just turned. The result is a striking mold growth on the rind that varies between over the seasons, expressing changes in milk composition. “We let this cheese have a wild streak,” says co-owner Padgett Arnold.Sequatchie Cove’s best selling cheese at the farmers market, Cumberland is reminiscent of a barn, with a humid and pungent smell that is especially earthy and powerful toward the rind. A malleable, dense, golden paste reveals a mild flavor with a clean lactic finish. Aromas of mushrooms, flowers and grass can be detected.Pair it with a full-bodied, dry white wine or with a tempranillo."

The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. Cumin Spiced Cheddar is a cumin-spiked version of his Aged White Cheddar, which is matured for over a year.Cumin Spiced Cheddar is firm in texture, with cumin seeds scattered throughout a pale yellow paste. Flavor is sharp and nutty upfront, rounded out with a kick of spice at the finish.Pair it with a dark beer or with a pinot noir. "

Over the years, they have developed excellent dairy and milking genetics in the herd, which have greatly helped other American LaMancha dairies improve their stock.Goat`s Leap is a seasonal dairy. Cheesemaking normally commences in April and lasts until late October or early November. The cheeses that Barbara makes also reflect the seasons. Every day, weather permitting, the goats are taken out onto the hillside above the house to browse the native California shrubs and bushes.Barbara makes a variety of predominently younger, mold ripened cheeses in the tiny cheese room, just up the hill from the house.What sets Barbara`s cheeses apart is not just the flavor but their texture. Starting with very high quality milk, Barbara handles the curd for her cheeses with great dexterity that results in some of the finest, silkiest textures of any American cheeses on the market.Dafne is a mold ripened wheel weighing about 1.5lbs. The rind is coated with a white, bloomy mold, and the interior paste of the cheese is bone-white in color. Barbara decorates each round with a bay leaf and seasonal flowers.The texture is consistently smooth and mousse-like in the center of the cheese, becoming softer and slightly more runny just under the rind as the cheese ages.Flavors are delicate and citrus-like, with hints of milk and a slight spicyness imparted by the bay leaf."
Dairyland Farmers Cheese,Chapel Hill Creamery,United States,North Carolina,"1” tall, 4” diameter",8 oz,www.chapelhillcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,None,Fresh,,"Eponymously named Chapel Hill Creamery is located near Chapel Hill in North Carolina and is home to Portia McKnight and Flo Hawley together with their small herd of Jersey cows. Hawley and McKnight had each enjoyed long careers at Whole Foods Market and decided they wanted to get closer to the source of the food that they had sold. In the process of searching for a good milk source in order to begin making cheese, they found that they were unable to get the quality that they wanted. So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced. Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012. Dairyland Farmer’s Cheese is a fresh loosely formed cheese made of pasteurized cow’s milk. It has a clean, lactic flavor with a touch of citrusy tang. The texture is silky and rich. The aroma is rich, a lot like freshly baked bread. Dairyland Farmer’s Cheese has the shape of the basket mold that the curds are placed in to drain.With this simple cheese, the best pairing is with a simple, spritzy wine such as Vinho Verde. It can be served with honey or fruit preserves spread over warm bread, or used in Mexican food as an alternative to Queso Fresco."

During this time, the cheeses are washed in red wine each day prior to being sold. The result is a firm, mountain style cheese with wine and slight barnyard aromas. The rind is red-brown in color with a texture of raised dots on the surface. The interior texture is ivory white in color, smooth and firm with intense flavors of grass and fruit."
Danbo with Caraway,Denmark's Tradition,Denmark,Vejle,"8-9 ins diameter, 4 ins high",12 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Waxed,,,"Made from pasteurized cow’s milk near Syddanmark in Denmark, Danbo is one of the country’s most popular cheeses. It is available in several versions, often with the addition of flavorings. When made with caraway seeds, it’s sometimes known as ""King Christian” cheese, named after King Christian IX who reigned in Denmark during the late 19th and early 20th century. The cheese was originally created in the late 19th century by a cheesemaker called Rasmus Nielsen when it was known as Solost or “Sun cheese”. Its popularity grew quickly until in 1952 it was renamed “Danbo” by the Stresca Convention in order to give it a more Danish sounding name. Danbo is often eaten as a breakfast cheese and also has excellent melting qualities. This version of Danbo is made by a second generation cheesemaker at a dairy in Syddanmark that was founded in 1909. Having been a cooperative for many years, the business was running into trouble when it was bought out by the current family owners in 1959. Private enterprise is extremely unusual in Denmark with approxiamtely 95% of cheese production taking place within a cooperative environment. Danbo is a washed-rind and smear-ripened cheese. However, in order to help the cheese retain moisture, the smear is washed off before being packaged for sale and replaced with a delicate wax coating.The texture of Danbo is soft and slightly springy with a smooth interior paste dotted with tiny holes and caraway seeds."
Dancing Fern,Sequatchie Cove Farm,United States,Tennessee,6 in diameter x 1-1.5 in height,1-1.5 lbs,www.sequatchiecovefarm.com,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Set in the shade of the Cumberland Plateau outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, Sequatchie Cove Farm is a diversified farm of 300 acres. Under the direction of Bill and Miriam Keener and their family, the farm includes a plant nursery and berry farm, as well as extensive pasture for the production of dairy, beef, lamb and pork. Animals graze year-round on the pasture, and no pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones are used. Raw milk for cheese production is sourced exclusively from Sequatchie Cove’s diverse herd of dairy cows. The milk for this Reblochon-style cheese comes from Devon cattle, an uncommon breed in the United States. Aged for 60 days, the small wheels are washed repeatedly during the early phase of the ripening period. Because Dancing Fern is made with raw milk, the cheese tends to evolve along with the seasons as a result of changes in the pasture. Batches early in the year are milder, with a firmer texture. As spring approaches, cows begin eating more fresh grass, which comes through in the flavor profile, while the texture becomes noticeably softer. The peak season for the cheese is summer.Dancing Fern is soft and gooey, texture becoming increasingly creamy toward its center. Barnyardy and mushroomy aromas dominate in the nose, while on the palate the cheese is buttery and full-bodied with slightly funky and fruity notes.Pair it with an oaky chardonnay or with anIPA."
Dante,Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Coop,United States,Wisconsin,"10 ins diameter,  5 ins high",8 lbs,,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Plasticoat,,,"When the Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Cooperative was formed in the 1990s, sheep’s milk cheesemaking in America had until then been a young and struggling industry, in which many startups quickly fizzled out. When the cheese plant Montchevrein WI decided to start using sheep`s milk, they decided that they’d do it only if they could work with a single source that handled all of the licensing, inspections, inventory and payment. So local sheep farmers responded by forming the WSDC to organize sheep dairying into a more reliable, standardized profession. When the co-op ended up with a surplus of milk, members decided to start making their own cheese. And they looked to SpanishManchego-one of the most well-known sheep`s milk cheeses in the world - for inspiration. There was no local version of Manchego for the co-op cheesemakers to replicate, so they decided to figure out how to do it at home, maximizing their method`s compatibility with their local terroir. They partnered with the University of Wisconsin-Madison,which actually has its own sheep dairy research center, to develop a recipe. Milk is sourced from mostly East Friesian and Laucane Breed ewes of member farmers. During spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and are fed a limited amount of natural grain while being milked. Like Spanish Manchego, Dante is 100% sheep`s milk. To make the cheese, the milk is gently pasteurized before starter cultures and rennet are added. Once the curd is formed and cut, the whey is drained off and the remaining curds put into plastic molds for pressing. After unmolding, the wheels are transferred to a temperature and humidity controlled aging facility at Cedar Grove Cheese in southern Wisconsin, where they’re aged for at least six months before release. During this time, they’re covered with an edible poly-coating to help preserve moisture and control mold growth.Flavors of Dante are sweet with notes of toast, butter, grass and lanolin. The texture is slightly pliant and moist, with more aged wheels becoming slightly drier and more crumbly."

Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. But during the Great Depression, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying milk from local farms—an arrangement that continues today. To create Dark Moon, fresh rounds of Petite Crème are hand-dusted with ash. During 10-14 days of aging a thin, white mold grows on the outside of the dusky layer, while a lovely creamline develops beneath it.Intense notes of basement and mushroom on the nose are coupled with a mild, salty flavor and hints of cereals and vegetal aromas on the palate. Pair it with quince paste, toasted hazelnuts, a muscatel or a pinot noir."

Today the farm boasts one of the largest herds of Holstein cows in France, and the milk produced is made into several types of cheese, as well as butter and other dairy products. The farm’s Brie cheeses are produced with respect for artisanal traditions; for example, the curd is hand-scooped into molds using a pelle à brie, and whey drains out of the cheeses on top of a traditional straw mat. A brie-style mold ripened cheese with a layer of pureed black truffles and truffle oil running through the middle, Délice de Favières is Trente Arpents’ take on the popular Brie Trufflé, which graces French tables around Christmas and New Year’s.Délice de Favières is has a creamy, oozing, yellow-colored paste surrounding a layer of black flakes.

Rhonda and Roy Gothberg bought the property in 2001. At the time, it was a former cow dairy that had become run-down, so they initiated a program of extensive repairs and renovations with a view to making it suitable for a dairy goat farm and creamery. The first goats arrived at Gothberg in April 2002. Having originally started with two does, Rhonda quickly found that she had more milk than the family could consume and decided to try her hand at making cheese. Encouraged by the results, she was inspired to continue. After completing the Cheesemakers’ Short Course at Washington State University, she set about the construction of a new barn and cheesemaking facility. Milk is sourced from Gothberg Farm’s own herd of 20 milking purebred LaMancha goats; a breed known for its quality milk that contains high levels of fat and protein. At any given time there are about 50 LaMancha goats on the farm. This includes the milking does, non-milking does, kids, and bucks. Rhonda produces a wide variety of hand crafted cheeses at Gothberg Farms using her 52 gallon vat pasteurizer. Inspired by a cheese that Rhonda tasted during a trip to Italy, Delizia della Tavola is made from pasteurized goat’s milk. The base recipe uses Gothberg Farm’s gouda, ensuring a rich, buttery-flavored cheese. The name of the cheese translates to “Delight of the Table’.During aging, the rind is rubbed with olive oil and a blend of basil, rosemary, savory and sage, creating herbaceous, umami aromas that balance and lengthen the lactic notes of the interior paste.Delizia della Tavola pairs well with wines such as Sauvignon Blanc and Hard Ciders."

Having owned the farm for a number of years, Elizabeth started milking cows and experimenting with cheesemaking in 1997 with a view to keeping the farm alive and sustainable. Two years later in 1999, Mark left his job to join her and, after they had each taken several workshops and courses, they were able to begin cheese production in earnest. The farm is home to a mixed herd of Jersey and Brown Swiss cows that graze outside from May to the end of October. During the winter months they eat only natural fodder and supplements. Mark is the primary cheesemaker at Cato Corner and is also responsible for the cheese aging. Elizabeth manages the farm and milking. All the cheeses are made by hand in small batches from raw milk. Mark makes a variety of cheeses, the style of each type being suited to the seasonal components and characteristics of the milk. The production process for Despearado closely mirrors that of Cato Corner Farm’s Hooligan, but the final products differ due to different treatments during maturation. During at least 60 days of aging, wheels of Despearado are washed weekly with an alcoholic pear mash derived from Bartlett pears. The mash, which is produced by local distillery Westford Hill, serves as the base for a Pear William eau-de-vie. “It’s like staining a piece of furniture,” says Mark Gillman, “a very light application that builds up over time and gives it complex character.”With an apricot-colored rind speckled with dark purple patches, Despearado exhibits seriously funky, barnyardy aromas. The rind boasts gamey flavors and undertones of wet bark and fresh mushrooms, while the custard creamline is dominated by hints of braised meat and candied fruit, followed by yogurt and high acid notes in the dense, cakey center.Pair Despearado with a Zinfandel, a Riesling or a pear cider."

However, a few years ago Ben & Robin decided to expand their range and buy in cow`s milk from a local herd of Friesians to make Devon Blue.For production, milk is warmed before the starter culture is added, which includes the addition of the mold Penicillium Roqueforti, responsible for developing the blue veins and pockets in the cheese. Unusually, after being cut, the curds for Devon Blue are put into molds without being pre-drained. This means that the cheeses have a high moisture level in the early stages. To offset this, wheels are turned frequently for the first two days after being unmolded and are kept very warm at a temperature of 72°F. Thereafter, they are rubbed with salt and pierced to allow air to enter.Cheeses are transferred to a maturing room and kept for three or four weeks, by which time the blue mold is beginning to develop. They are then wrapped in foil and matured for a further six to eight months, by which time the mold has developed fully.Made in a 6lb. wheel, the paste of Devon blue is a pale, yellow-cream color, stippled with blue pockets and veins.The texture is dense and slightly crumbly.

Of his eleven dairy animals, Kurt milks approximately four cows, all of which are on the property. Cheesemaking got under way in earnest in June 2009 with the creation of Dinah. For production, Kurt adds mesophilic starter cultures Geotricum candidum and Penicilium candidum to the milk, followed by a traditional animal rennet to coagulate it. Once formed, the curd is carefully hand-ladled into molds and allowed to drain under its own weight for 24 hours. During this time each cheese is flipped top to bottom to encourage even drainage before being removed and dry-salted. The cheeses are then transferred to an aging room where they remain for seven days at a temperature of 50–55°F before being wrapped in special, double-layered, and breathable cheese paper. They then mature for up to another 25 days at a colder temperature of 46–48°F. Kurt makes approximately 96 cheeses per batch, and cheese production takes place every two days.

The history of the company dates back to the early 1900s, when Ernesto Carpenedo began working as a “casoin” (a word in local dialect for a cheesemonger) in a shop in the village of Preganziol. Ernesto eventually founded his own company, which is today run by his son Antonio and his grandsons Ernesto and Alessandro, who have over thirty years of experience in the dairy-cheese sector. Antonio has been devoting his attention to affinage since 1976, the year that he began steeping his first rounds of cheese in wine, giving birth to La Casearia’s signature Ubriaco (which translates into “drunken”).  Dolomitico alla Birra is a blue cheese with a beer-washed rind. Aged for a minimum of 50 days, wheels are washed in both barley malt and in a double malt beer from Italy’s Dolomite region.Dolomitico alla Birra has a dark brown rind and a dense, crumbly paste with blue veins. Scent is malty and flavor is intense and persistent with toasty notes.Pair it with a stout."
Dorset,Consider Bardwell Farm,,Vermont,"8 ins diameter, 3 ins high",2.5 lbs,www.considerbardwellfarm.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Washed,,,"From Consider Bardwell Farm,Dorset is a semi-soft, washed rind cheese made with raw Jersey cow`s milk.The texture is rich and buttery. While the aroma can be quite pungent—as is often the case with washed rind cheeses—the flavors are quite mild, but with lingering savory notes. As described by the cheesemakers at Consider Bardwell, Dorset is a buttery, soft, and expressive cow`s milk cheese inspired by washed rind forefathers like Taleggio. Each wheel is hand scrubbed with a brine solution three times per week as they age so that a mildly pungent flavor develops, often with hints of green olive and vegetable broth. With pasture-raised milk and spa-caliber attention in the caves, Dorset exemplifies how delicious “funky"" can be. Straddling the rolling hills of the Vermont and New York state line, Consider Bardwell Farm is a dairy and creamery with very old roots. The farm, founded in 1863 by Consider Stebbins Bardwell, was the first cheesemaking co-op in Vermont. At that time, morning milk from surrounding farms was brought by open horse-drawn wagons and made into large wheels of cheese that were shipped by train to Boston and Albany. Fast forward to 2001, when Angela Miller and Russell Glover purchased the farm and recreated the creamery with the expertise of a local Vermont cheesemaker. Leslie Goff, the Creamery Director, has perfected the six basic cheeses over the past decade. A herd of Swiss, French, and Nubian dairy goats, as well as a neighbor’s Jersey cow herd, are rotationally grazed on the farm’s 150 acres of certified organic grassland. Consider Bardwell’s creamery produces three cow and three goat cheeses, all of which are made in small batches with the use of microbial rennet, and are aged in the creamery’s ripening rooms.Savory and vegetal notes are present, along with the buttery qualities associated with Jersey milk. The cheese has a pleasant, milky flavor and a long finish."

The curd is maneuvered into large, plastic mesh sacks and leftto drain naturally. This gentle process creates a delicate, mousse-like texture in the finished cheese. After draining, molded cheeses are brined and rolled in vegetable ash before being transferred to a maturing room and aged for two to three weeks.As the white mold of the Penicilium Candidum grows over the ash, the rind of Dorstone becomes an appealing blend of grey and white. As the cheeses age, a blue-green mold begins to dominate, and the rind becoms more wrinkly.The interior paste of the cheese is dense, velvety and bone-white in color. Flavors are delicate and deliciously savory, with hints of citrus and grass."
Double Gloucester (Appleby's),Appleby's of Hawkstone,United Kingdom,Cheshire,"12-14 ins diameter, 5 ins high",18 lbs,http://www.applebyscheese.co.uk,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Cloth Wrapped,,,"The Appleby family have been making cheese at Hawkstone Abbey Farm in Cheshire, England for three generations. The farm and dairy are managed by Edward and Christine Appleby, helped by their children Paul and Clare and daughter in law Sarah. Raw milk for cheesemaking comes from their own herd of Friesian Holstein cows that graze on pastures planted with traditional slow-growing grasses. The natural salt and mineral deposits in the sandy earth of the Cheshire Plain come through in these grasses, and it is said that these contribute to the subtle mineral flavours of the Appleby’s cheeses. In addition, the cows are fed maize, wholecrop and grass silage. The silage, which has more dry matter than grass, helps the cows create more fats and proteins in the milk, affecting the flavor and texture of the finished cheese. The Applebys work with head cheesemaker Garry Gray to produce both Cheshire and Double Gloucester cheeses. Less acidic and smoother in texture than Cheshire, Double Gloucester is a three hundred year old recipe, which the Appleby’s resurrected in 1986. The family researched the making of Double Gloucester using the original recipe book from when Lucy Appleby MBE, Edward’s mother, learnt her craft of cheese making at Reaseheath College. After years of experimenting, the family eventually found their preferred recipe from the archives of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and this recipe continues to be used today. Gloucester cheese comes in both Single and Double varieties. Single Gloucester is made from partly skimmed milk resulting in a cheese usually 2-2.5” high. On the other hand, Double Gloucester is made from whole fat milk taken from both the morning and evening milking to make a cheese of usually 4.5” high. The whole fat milk results in a cheese which is richer and creamier in texture than the Single Gloucester version. The orange colored paste is a result of the addition of annatto, a natural vegetable coloring that has been a traditional characteristic of Gloucester cheese since the 16th Century. Appleby’s Double Gloucester uses the same ingredients as Appleby’s Cheshire (see separate entry) with variations during production with the timing, temperature and acidity of the curd. It takes around 4 hours 20 minutes, at a temperature of up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, for the milk to reach the correct acidity after renneting, compared to just over 3 hours for Cheshire, at a lower temperature. The cut curds are then pressed for 48 hours and then wrapped in cloth, before being matured for up to 8 weeks. The resulting cheese has a firm yet moist texture. Flavors are remeniscent of warm, buttered toast with underlying notes of minerals and salt a lengthy, slightly tangy finish."
Double Gloucester (Smart's),Old Ley Farm/Smart's Farm,United Kingdom,Gloucestershire,"10 ins diameter, 5 ins high",8 lb, www.smartsgloucestercheese.com,Cow,,Hard,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Made by Diana Smart at Old Ley Farm in Gloucestershire, England, Smart`s Double Gloucester is made from raw milk of the heritage breed of Gloucester cow.For centuries, Gloucester cattle have been associated with the making of Double Gloucester and its sister cheese, Single Gloucester. Both cheeses were traditionally made by the same producer, although the Double Gloucester is larger format and has a fuller flavor than Single Gloucester, which may explain the name. The main difference between the two cheeses is that Single Gloucester is made with skimmed milk from the evening milking, mixed with full cream milk from the morning milking, whereas Double Gloucester uses full cream milk from both the evening and morning milkings.Diana makes her Double Gloucester twice each week. As the milk is heated to 86°F, starter culture and anatto (a natural red dye derived from the seed of the South American anatto shrub) are added. After coagulation and cutting, the curd is heated again to 100°F for 40 minutes, then drained of whey (which is fed to some very happy pigs), then ""stacked"" to extrude more whey, and then milled and salted. Finally, the curds are put into molds and pressed for two days before being transferred to the maturing room to be aged for about six months.Smart`s Double Gloucester has a bright orange, slightly waxy paste with a dense, crumbly texture. The rind is natural and quite tough.Flavors are pronounced, yet balanced, with notes of earth, smoke and bacon."

They started off by using milk from their own herd of cows, but in recent years found that they wanted to focus more on the cheesemaking. Willem and Meja are now buying in their milk from a neighboring farm. Milk for cheesemaking is heat-treated rather than pasteurized, thereby keeping some of the original flavors of the milk. In addition to making a range of goudas, Willem also produces a small, unique cheese called Dragon’s Breath Blue. Made from heat treated milk, Dragon’s Breath Blue is a soft, blue cheese encased in a small outer layer of black wax. Aromas are gentle while flavors are spicy and rich yet balanced."
Dream Weaver,Central Coast Creamery,United States,California,,,centralcoastcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,,Washed,Washed-Rind,," After working for years in product development and quality control in industrial cheese production settings, cheesemaker Reggie Jones finally decided to branch off on his own and pursue small-scale artisanal production. He founded Central Coast Creamery in Paso Robles, CA in 2008. Today he specializes in producing aged cheeses that are handmade in small batches using local California milk and organic ingredients. Dream Weaver is Jones` first washed rind cheese. “I’ve had the recipe in my head for a long time. I knew it would be good, but it turned out even better than what I thought we could do. The flavor profile is tremendous.” The basket weave on the exterior of the roughly three-pound wheels is partially what inspired its evocative moniker. “We’re always looking for something that people will remember, and I don’t think there’s a more catchy song than Dream Weaver,” says Jones. “Every time we tell somebody the name of this cheese, they start singing it.”The pudgy, yeasty goat’s milk cheese is stinky but approachable, sweet and creamy, with a rind that’s dry to the touch.Erin Harris, ACS CCP and cheese specialist, suggests pairing this cheese with a sweet and tangy tomato jam. ""The jam will help to cut through all of that richness in the cheese, and together create a nice balance of sweet and savory,"" she says. "
Driftless,Hidden Springs Creamery,United States,Wisconsin,Varies,6 oz,www.hiddenspringscreamery.com,Sheep,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,Fresh,Fresh,Flavor added to paste," Rich yet fluffy and in a range of flavors that offer something for everyone, Driftless is a delectable fresh sheep`s milk cheese. It`s produced by Brenda Jensen at Hidden Springs Farm, located in southwest Wisconsin. Jensen and her husband, Dean, live in the heart of Amish country. They own seventy-six acres of land, much of which is allocated to grazing for their flock of over 500 of Lacaune and East Friesian dairy sheep. Hidden Springs Farm and Creamery strives to be sustainable, both environmentally and financially. Since the Jensens are in the middle of Amish farm country, they appreciate Amish values and work practices. They employ Amish friends and neighbors for both milking and construction. A team of Percheron draft horses (not tractors) plow their fields, and a donkey keep coyotes and other predators away from their lambs. Today Brenda has around eight cheeses available, although Driftless was her first. The cheese is named after the Driftless Region which gets its name from its lack of “drift,” a mixture of sand rock and silt left behind by retreating glaciers. To make it, Brenda adds rennet to the milk to make a soft curd, and then hand-ladles the cheese into mesh bags to drain. The cheese is then transferred into containers for sale. Driftless comes in a variety of flavors including Basil & Olive Oil, Cranberry & Cinnamon, Tomato & Garlic, Pumpkin (seasonal), Maple, and Honey & Lavender.Since Driftless is a fresh cheese, the texture is moist and tangy. Due to the richness of sheep`s milk, the mouthfeel is very creamy and dense. Flavors are bright and lactic, with notes of grass and hay.Jensen like to dip carrots in the Natural flavor, spread Cranberry over graham crackers, dollop Pumpkin onto a molasses cookie, and mix Basil & Olive Oil and Tomato & Garlic with warm pasta as a sauce. The Honey & Lavender flavor is good enough to eat with a spoon, she adds."

The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. Drunken Cheddar is a flavored version of his Aged White Cheddar, which is matured for over a year. Wheels of the cheese are placed in a bath of local Utah red wine to soak up its flavors.Drunken Cheddar has a firm, crumbly, yellow paste and a deep, dark purple rind.

Drunken Goat,Central Quesera Montesinos,Spain,Murcia,"8 in diameter, 6 in height",5 lbs,www.montesinos.es,Goat,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,,Flavor added to rind," Drunken Goat, a version of Spanish goat`s milk Queso de Murcia DOP, is produced by Central Quesera Montesinos in the village of Jumilla in Spain`s Murcia region. Murcian cheesemakers have been making versions of this wine-washed goat`s milk wheel—from the milk of protein- and fat-rich Murciana goat`s milk—for years. Today only three or four producers of the DOP cheese remain. This version is imported under the name Drunken Goat by Forever Cheese, a U.S.-based importer and distributor. The most striking characteristic of Drunken Goat—and the attribute that gives it its name—is the fact that the cheese is soaked in Doble Pasta wine, a locally-famous wine made from the Monastrell grape. Originally, young wheels were soaked in wine early on and then aged, however the practice resulted in fissures in the cheese`s paste; today, wheels are soaked towards the end of its aging period of up to 75 days.The result is a smooth, violet-colored rind, encasing a startlingly white interior. The texture is semifirm, dense, smooth and creamy but typically remains supple.Flavors are mild, sweet, and fruity.Pair Drunken Goat with a medium-bodied red, serve it alongside fig cakes, or drizzle it with orange blossom honey."

Having owned the farm for a number of years, Elizabeth started milking cows and experimenting with cheesemaking in 1997 with a view to keeping the farm alive and sustainable. Two years later in 1999, Mark left his job to join her and, after they had each taken several workshops and courses, they were able to begin cheese production in earnest. The farm is home to a mixed herd of forty Jersey and Brown Swiss cows that graze outside from May to the end of October. During the winter months they eat only natural fodder and supplements. Mark is the primary cheesemaker at Cato Corner and is also responsible for the cheese aging. Elizabeth manages the farm and milking. All the cheeses are made by hand in small batches from raw milk. Mark makes a variety of cheeses, the style of each type being suited to the seasonal components and characteristics of the milk. One of the cheeses, Drunken Hooligan, is a version of Cato Corner`s Hooligan and is produced seasonally from November to January. As the name implies, Drunken Hooligan is washed with a blend of local grape must and red wine, sourced from Priam Vineyard in nearby Colchester. The resulting red colored rind encases a cheese that is less pungent and `stinky` than regular Hooligan. Instead, flavors are aromatic and wine-like with distinctly fruity vegetal notes."
Dry Jack Special Select,Vella Cheese Company,United States,California,11-12ins diameter,8 lbs, www.vellacheese.com,Cow,,Hard,Vegetable,FlavoredCocoa,,,"Produced since 1931 by the Vella family in Sonoma County, California, Dry Jack is a true American original.According to Ig Vella, who owns and runs the business, Monterey Jack cheese was created by a Scotsman named David Jacks in the days of the California gold rush. At the beginning of WW1, an American purveyor called D.F. DiBernardi developed Dry Jack - an aged version of Monterey Jack - to replace the imported Italian cheeses (mostly Parmesan and Grana) that were no longer available because of the war. It had a flavor and texture similar to a medium aged Parmesan.Ig`s father, Tom Vella, formed his own company called the Sonoma Mission Creamery in 1931 and perfected his own version of Dry Jack. The recipe has hardly changed.Quality cow`s milk for Dry Jack is sourced from a nearby herd of cows that comprises of two thirds Holstein and one third Guernsey.Charlie Malkassian is Head Cheesemaker at Vella, having learned the craft from Ig, who learned it from his father, Tom.For production of Dry Jack, the milk is pasteurized and, after cutting and initial draining (similar to cheddar production), the curds are tied in muslin sacks, all of which are shaped and pressed by hand. The imprints of the cloth are clearly visible in the finished cheese.After drying, cheeses are brined for three days, then transferrred to the maturing rooms where they receive their distinct coating from of a blend of cocoa, vegetable oil and black pepper. This is a traditional idea that originated in Italy and helps to protect the cheeses during their seven to ten months of aging.Dry Jack is sold at several different ages. The youngest cheeses (seven to ten months) are referred to as Dry Jack. Wheels aged for a minimum of one year are called Special Select, and then there is Golden Bear, which refers to wheels aged for two to four years.The texture of Dry Jack is firm, graduating to hard in the older wheels, when it also becomes increasingly brittle.Flavors are distinctly sweet, mushroomy and often contain savory notes of grass or hay and earth."
Duchess,Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Coop,United States,Wisconsin,10 in diameter x 4 in height ,,www.sheepmilk.biz,Sheep,,Hard,Vegetable,,,,"When the Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Cooperative was formed in the 1990s, sheep’s milk cheesemaking in America was a young and struggling industry in which small startups often fizzled out. When the cheese plant Montchevrein WI decided to start using sheep`s milk, they decided to do it only if they could work with a single source that handled all of the licensing, inspections, inventory and payment. So local sheep farmers responded by forming the WSDC to organize sheep dairying into a more reliable, standardized profession. When the co-op ended up with a surplus of milk, members decided to start making their own cheese.Milk is sourced from mostly East Friesian and Laucane Breed ewes of member farmers. During spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and are fed a limited amount of natural grain while being milked.Duchess is an Edam-style cheese with a reduced fat content. It’s made with 100% sheep’s milk and aged for at least six months. Its texture is light and feathery, and its flavor is salty, sharp and slightly tangy.Pair it with a Riesling or a Pinot Noir. For beer pairings, try an American Pale Ale or a Witbier. "
Dunbarton Blue,Roelli Cheese Haus,United States,Wisconsin,,7-8 lb.,https://www.roellicheese.com/,Cow,Pasteurised,FirmBlue,Animal,Natural,BlueCheddar-like,,"For Master Cheesemaker Chris Roelli of Wisconsin’s Roelli Cheese Haus, the inspiration for Dunbarton Blue was something similar to “a cracked wheel of bandaged cheddar that happened to turn blue.” What resulted was Dunbarton Blue, an earthy, English-style cheddar base with a kick of piquant blue flavor that’s pronounced but approachable.  Combining the two styles, Dunbarton Blue is pressed and cave-aged like a traditional English cheddar—but like a blue, it’s pierced and inoculated with Penicilium roqueforti mold spores before being cellar-aged. The cheese ages in cellars on wooden boards for about 90 days on wooden boards, during which time it develops a natural rind.  With a handful of awards under its belt, Dunbarton Blue is the flagship cheese for Roelli Cheese Haus, which is helmed by fourth-generation cheesemaker Chris Roelli. The Roelli family has been making cheese since the early 1920s.The rich, earthy flavor of English cheddar highlights Dunbarton`s slight blue zing for a cheese that`s distinct and pleasantly balanced. While the blue flavor is noticeable, it`s not overwhelming, making this a good pick for those new to blue.This flavorful cheese pairs well with sweeter accompaniments likehoney, riesling, or Belgian style beer. (Need something bigger? Dunbarton Blue is full-bodied enough to hold up to rich brown ales and even barleywine.)"

Durrus,Jeffa Gill,Ireland,Co. Cork Cork,"6-7 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",3 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced by Jeffa Gill in Co. Cork, Ireland, Durrus is a semisoft, washed rind, cow`s milk cheese. A former fashion designer in London and Dublin, Jeffa left the city life in the early 1970s and first started making cheese in a pan on her kitchen stove using the milk of her eight cows. The cheese quickly became popular and a permanent dairy was constructed, complete with a copper cheesemaking vat and maturing rooms. In 1990, finding that she was getting busier and needed to concentrate more on cheesemaking, Jeffa sold her cows. Milk is now sourced from two neighboring farms whose Friesian cows graze the hills above Dunmanus Bay. It takes approximately two gallons of milk to make each cheese. For production of Durrus, milk is coagulated and the curds are cut with a Swiss harp (cutting tool) that is rotated through the curd in a particular way. Curds are put into molds and drain naturally, which helps to retain moisture in the cheese. After unmolding, the cheeses are brined and then turned and washed up to five times a day before making their way to the maturing rooms. Durrus Irish farmhouse cheese has become known as one of the finest examples of modern Irish cheeses made using artisanal methods. Like most washed rind cheeses, the aroma of Durrus is much more pungent and assertive than its flavor.A sparkling white will play up Durrus` fruitiness while cutting through its fatty texture."

Since 2014 the creamery has been owned by chefs Greg Tatis and Monica Jaramillo, who specialize in recipe development and cheesemaking, as well as by Pete and Heather Holmes, who specialize in sales and marketing. The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw/thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. Dutch Chocolate is a flavored version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park. Described as a cross between a brie and a farm cheese, the production process for these these bloomy-rinded discs is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling Inspired by an Ecuadorian tradition of drinking hot cocoa alongside cheese, this cheese reveals a gorgeous brown marbling beneath its fuzzy white rind, due to the addition of single-origin cocoa to the curds before molding. Discs are aged from three to four weeks.The single-origin cocoa used in production of this cheese is not very bitter; rather it possesses a variety of tropical notes. Although no sweetener is added, the cocoa gives the cheese a lightly sweet touch. Aromas of chocolate are present on the nose and in the aftertaste, however flavor is only very mildly chocolaty, with floral and tree bark aromas detectable.Pair it with a dry and spicy wine such as Tempranillo, or with a stout. Charleston’s cheesemakers also suggest serving it with berry compote and candied pecans, or in a grilled cheese sandwich."

The village is located in the high mountains of the Vaud region, where cows travel up in altitude to graze during summer months. Much of the high-quality milk in the region is transformed into L’Etivaz cheese, but the fromagerie Fleurette focuses on the production of mostly smaller-format, original cheeses. Cheesemaker Michel Béroud apparently thought of the idea for Dzorette cheese when he drunkenly dropped a cheese under his Christmas tree and then ate it. Appreciating the flavor but off-put by the stabbing of the pine needles, Béroud experimented with cutting them down to be more masticable. The experiment gave birth to this mold-ripened cheese, which is dusted with cut fir tree needles while aging.A fluffy, light and crumbly white paste is surrounded by an oozing creamline and a bloomy rind studded with fir needles. The paste is lactic and mild with a hint of acidity, juxtaposed with a very flavorful rind, which contributes fresh notes of pine, citrus and thyme.Pair it with a red ale or with an IPA."
Early Snow,Nettle Meadow Farm and Artisan Cheese,United States,New York,,,nettlemeadow.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold RipenedHerbed,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to paste," This dainty pyramid hails from near the Adirondack Mountains of New York, on a dairy run by Sheila Flanagan and Lorraine Lambiase. Nettle Meadow’s origins date back to 1993, when Raynald Hebert and his wife Laurie Goodheart transformed an old farmstead into a small cheesemaking facility and enough acreage to support approximately thirty goats. Its name was a reflection of the wild nettles and herbs that made up the goats’ diet.  Twelve years after its founding, the farm was sold to Sheila and Lorraine, both of whom had been living in California and were seeking a complete change of direction. Since 2005 they have worked extensively to expand the operation. Now spanning 75 acres, it is home to over 360 Alpine, Nubian, Saanen and mixed breed goats, several dozen East Freisian sheep and a variety of other farm animals currently cared for by the farm’s sanctuary. In 2017, estimated production will be over 150,000 pounds of cheese. Sheila and Lorraine are passionate supporters of the farming lifestyle, the human care of animals and artisan cheese and run the farm with the assistance of Sheila’s mother Joan together with eighteen employees.  Unlike most of Nettle Meadow’s cheeses, Early Snow is made with cow’s milk. Formed into a pyramid shape, young cheeses are dusted with an Herbes de Provence blend. During aging, they develop a white bloomy rind on top, the resulting cheeses reminiscent of early season snowfall on a leaf-covered Adirondack mountain hillside. Notes of butter with a lemony tang give way to a foresty herbaceousness and a dense, fluffy texture—not unlike crunching through the first snow. Pair it with a baguette and a floral spring honey and sauvignon blanc, or even gin, to bring out those perfect herbaceous notes and play with the goaty flavors."
Earthquake,Everona Dairy,United States,Virginia,"4” tall, 9” diameter",5 lbs,www.everonadairy.com,Sheep,Raw,Firm,Animal,Washed,,,"It is rare indeed that a dog began a dairy, but that is exactly what happened in the case of Everona Dairy. At a Food Festival in 1992, the late Dr. Patricia (Pat) Elliot came upon a demonstration of the skills of Border Collies and was so impressed, she took a puppy home with her. Soon it became obvious that the dog needed something to keep occupied, and what is the best thing to keep a Border Collie occupied? Sheep. So, sheep were purchased and in time began to drain the good doctor’s bank account. In an effort to have the sheep pay for themselves, Dr. Elliot began milking them with a view to developing a cheesemaking operation. Whereas some people might be daunted by the prospect of taking on an additional new cheesemaking career with no previous knowledge of sheep or making cheese, Dr. Elliot was undeterred. A medical doctor who had raised seven children and adopted two others, while simultaneously putting herself through medical school, she was well equipped with the determination to teach herself how to make cheese. Pat was also a life-long DIYer and, after reading books on the topic, at age 67 took classes at the University of Wisconsin to learn the scientific side of cheese making.  By 1996, she had also travelled to Greece for further education. While it took a long time to reach the skill-level necessary to produce great cheese, in 2005 the ACS awarded Everona`s Piedmont with its top honors in the Farmhouse Sheep’s milk cheese category. Until her death in 2013 at age 85, Dr. Elliot continued to practice medicine as well as helping to run the Dairy with her son, Brian, and daughter-in-law, Carolyn. In August 2011, the strongest earthquake to hit the east coast in 100 years was centered 15 miles away from Everona Dairy. As the earth shook, Pat and Carolyn were inspired to create a new cheese, Earthquake. This is a raw sheep’s milk cheese with an erratic line of ash running through the middle of the paste, signifying how the earth shook that day. The cheese has a cream colored interior and a slightly nutty, lactic and sweet grass flavor. Earthquake’s rich, semi-firm texture is the result of washing the rind and aging it for just 2 ½ months.With its grassy flavor, it is best to pair Earthquake with a German Rieslings. However, if red is the wine of choice, Zinfandels work very nicely. If beer is the preferred beverage, choose a Hefeweizen; the light wheat beer works nicely with the texture and flavor of Earthquake. The cheese has very subtle flavors, so it is best to serve this cheese with fruit such as grapes. In cooking, keep it simple in order to fully appreciate the character of the cheese."
Echo Mountain Blue,Rogue Creamery,United States,Oregon,about 6” x 5”,about 5lbs,www.roguecreamery.com,CowGoat,Pasteurised,BlueFirm,Vegetable,Natural,Blue,,"With 10 blue cheeses under their belt, Rogue Creamery makes each interesting and unique. Take Echo Mountain, Rogue’s rich and earthy mixed-milk blue. A combination of cow’s and goat’s milk makes it smooth and full-bodied, with a touch of tang.  David Gremmels and his partner bought Rogue Creamery on a handshake from Ig Vella of Vella Cheese Company in 2002. Rogue was originally founded in 1933 as a cooperative creamery.  Today, Rogue Creamery is a thriving business that produces a variety of award-winning cheeses including their multiple blues and cheddars. Milk for production comes from their own organic dairy in nearby Grants Pass. The dairy has 68 acres with a quarter-mile frontage on the river—a beautiful piece of property in a valley that used to be loaded with small dairies of 15-20 cows. Now, the Rogue Creamery Dairy has 180 cows, most of which are Brown Swiss and Holsteins.    When the weather permits, the cows go out on pasture daily from March to October The cows are not exclusively grass-fed, as they also get organic hay and grain. Echo Mountain is made from a blend of pasteurized cow`s and goat`s milk and aged for at least one year.Echo Mountain has spicy and tangy flavors overlaid with assertive earthy notes. The texture of the cheese is firm, dense, and crumbly. The paste is creamy white in color, punctuated by blue veins and pockets of blue-green mold.Echo Mountain Blue is the perfect cheese for stuffing pork and poultry. Complete the dish with other earthy foods like sage, onions, and spinach. A straightforward red like a Zinfandel or a full-bodied white like Viognier match this cheese’s delicate flavor and balances its funk with smooth, floral tones."
Echourgnac,Abbey of Our Lady of Good Hope,France,Dordogne,"3-4 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",10-12oz,http://abbaye-echourgnac.org/,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced at the Abbaye Notre-Dame de Bonne Espérance (our Lady of Good Hope) in the Dordogne, near Double in France, Trappe Echourgnac is made from pasteurized cow’s milk. The Abbey produces two versions of the cheese; a traditional recipe based on Port Salut and a newer version of the same cheese but washed with walnut liqueur (pictured). The Abbey was founded in 1852 by monks who came from the Abbey of Port Hi Mayenne, bringing with them the recipe for Port Salut. As they established their new monastery and, driven by their mission to help the people of Double, the monks created a cheesemaking facility and purchased milk from neighboring farms. In addition they worked with the farmers to improve milk quality by enhancing breeding programs, sanitation procedures and working to produce better grazing. Using this milk, the monks produced Echourgnac until 1910 when production ceased for a few years. However, in 1923 the Abbey was taken over by nuns who have continued the cheesemaking tradition by producing Echourgnac and, in 1999, also introducing a variation of the cheese washed with walnut liqueur. The liqueur is sourced from nearby Périgord, an area famous for its nut groves and also home to a distillery, known for its production of nut liqueurs. This newer version of Echourgnac has proved so popular that in 2003 years the nuns decided to share the recipe with the monks at Timadeuc in order to meet demand (see separate Timanoix Cheese Library entry). An uncooked, pressed cheese, wheels of Échourgnac are produced in two sizes and matured in the cellars for a minimum of three weeks prior to release for the smaller wheels and two months for the larger. Current production runs at 52 tons per annum, with approximately 70% of the cheese being consumed within the Dordogne region. The remaining 30% is distributed within the rest of France as well as exported to Germany and beyond.Trappe Echourgnac comes in 8oz rounds and has a semi soft texture.  The interior paste is pale straw in color while the exterior rind is a dark, rich brown – a result of the liqueur wash. Flavors are mild yet full and rich with smoky bacon notes and distinctive aromas of walnuts."

Goat`s Leap has built a deserved reputation for very high quality cheese from their small production and their herd of LaMancha goats. Over the years, they have developed excellent dairy and milking genetics in the herd, which have greatly helped other American LaMancha dairies improve their stock. Goat`s Leap is a seasonal dairy. Cheesemaking normally commences in April and lasts until late October or early November. The cheeses that Barbara makes also reflect the seasons. Every day, weather permitting, the goats are taken out onto the hillside above the house to browse the native California shrubs and bushes. Barbara makes a variety of predominently younger, mold ripened cheeses in the tiny cheese room, just up the hill from the house. What sets Barbara`s cheeses apart is not just the flavor but their texture. Starting with very high quality milk, Barbara handles the curd for her cheeses with great dexterity that results in some of the finest, silkiest textures of any American cheeses on the market. Eclipse has a wonderfully delicate texture, bisected by a fine horizontal line of ash in the center and a single Star Anise on top. Flavors are beautifully balanced with a milky, lactic freshness, pleasant citrus notes and a hint of Star Anise."

Sean works with one other cheesemaker, Jason Lippman and, depending on the season, they produce between 100-500 pounds of cheese per week across several different varieties. Named for the white mold “eclipsing” a dark layer of ash covering the cheese, Eclipse is a soft-textured, ash-ripened cheese made from pasteurized goat’s milk. Inspiration for its production came after a long period of experimentation and its popularity resulted in it being featured 2 years in a row (2010 and 2011) on a cheeseboard of the US Open.Eclipse has a dense yet smooth paste with flavors of sweet, fresh cream and mild goat. The ash that coats the rind of the cheese helps to balance out the acidity in the creating mellow and buttery notes. Eclipse pairs well with a Pinot Noir, bringing out the cheese’s earthy and mushroomy qualities."
Edelschaf Schafkäse,Sennerei Zillertal,Austria,Tyrol,,1 lb,www.sennerei-zillertal.at,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Washed,Alpine-style,,"Edelschaf means “noble sheep,” and it’s clear that the mountain farmers of Zillertal, Austria, focus their animals’ diets accordingly. Flocks feed exclusively on Alpine pastures of fresh grass, clovers, and herbs during summer, and on sun-dried hay and mineral-rich coarse grain in winter. Thus the milk qualifies as Heumilch, or “hay milk,” which may contain twice the amount of omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventional milk. Health benefits are not the only motivation to use Heumilch. By processing the milk of cows, goats, and sheep from 400 mountain farmers, Sennerei Zillertal helps to sustain the rural economy and traditional lifestyle in this mountainous area, which is also famous for its skiing. Made from pasteurized sheep’s milk and aged five months, firm Edelschaf-Schafskäse cheese is repeatedly smeared with cultures that turn its surface a striking red.Its flavor is der wurzige, or aromatic and savory. Notes of dark caramel, cocoa, almond, and walnut are interlaced with herbal nuances of cauliflower, boiled potatoes, and malt. Close to the rind, notes of ammonia and yeast are present from the red smear.Edelschaf-Schafskäse’s layered flavors require cured meats including salumi—plus a pint of hefeweizen."

Sister Margo Morris, one of the two original sisters, is still deeply involved and oversees the management of this progressive educational center. In addition to the cheesemaking component, Sprout Creek operates a fully functioning farm, a farmers` market, and residential courses. The courses are designed to give disadvantaged and inner city children a holistic taste of agricultural and rural life through full involvement with the workings of the farm. The Creamery component at Sprout Creek obtains milk from the farm`s own mixed herd of grass-fed Jersey, Guernsey, Milking Shorthorn and Brown Swiss cows. Cheesemaking methods are based on the European model and great attention is devoted to seasonality and animal welfare. Sprout Creek Creamery, under the guidance of cheesemaker Colin McGrath, producesa variety of cheeses from both goat`s and cow`s milk, ranging in style from soft, bloomy rinds to aged tommes.

Living in Waco, Texas in the traditional agricultural and crafts community Homestead Heritage, Rebeccah was looking for a way to use some extra spring milk that the community’s Brown Swiss cows had been producing. Using books and experimentation, she gradually began producing dairy products, hard and soft cheeses, eventually teaching her craft to others. In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheeses are raw milk cheeses. This is Brazos Valley’s best-selling brie-style cheese. Fresh curds are poured into molds to form wheels, then sprinkled with a layer of vegetable ash and stacked one on top of the other, forming two layers. After a sufficient amount of white surface mold has grown, the wheels are then wrapped in fig leaves from the farm and aged until they are a total of two months old.The off-white colored paste of this cheese is stunningly contrasted with a line of dark ash in the center and the leaves wrapped around the exterior. Smell is buttery and vegetal, with slight notes of sage, and taste is pleasant, mild and creamy with a hint of goaty bitterness.You could try pairing this cheese with a Champagne or with a Chardonnay, but Brazos Valley co-owner Marc Kuehl suggests otherwise: “Eden is so complex and unique,” he says, “we prefer to eat it just the way it is.”"

For a region traditionally associated with the production of Alpine or mountain style harder cheeses, this is fairly unusual. However, owner and cheesemaker Edwin Berchtold, has found this point of differentiation to be to his advantage. Among the range of soft cheeses that Edwin makes, his Münster is not intended to be a copy of the French cheese of the same name. Rather, it is an Edwin original which is why he puts his stamp on it by calling it Edwin`s Münster. The small plump rounds are made from milk sourced from a single farm, local to the production facility. Each cheese is marked with a cross-hatched pattern and during the aging process receives regular washing with a brine solution. This promotes the development of the bacterium linens cultures and therefore the breakdown and softening of the interior paste. Aromas and flavors of Edwin’s Münster are surprisingly mild and delicate - unlike its French namesake. The rind comprises of gently mottled orange and white patches that encase a pale, straw-colored interior. Flavors are redolent of earth, sweet milk and, especially during the summer months, grass.Pair with an Alsacian white wine, Gewurztraminer or a single malt Scotch."
Eidolon,The Grey Barn and Farm,United States,Massachusetts,3 in diameter x 3.25 in height,1 lb,www.thegreybarnandfarm.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Looking back on the decision to quit their day jobs and become farmers, Eric and Molly Glasgow recall having no idea what they were getting themselves into. Starting out by gardening in three square-meter patch of soil, the Glasgows and their two children eventually upgraded to a farm in Martha’s Vineyard in 2009. They’d been coming to the small island off the coast of Massachusetts during summer vacations for years, and were impressed by its vibrant core of small family farms, its arts and food scene, and its natural beauty. After years of research and planning, the Glasgows finally obtained their first three cows in 2010. Today the Certified Organic farm boasts a herd of 25 heritage breed Dutch Belted cows. The cows are grass fed and moved twice a day throughout the farm’s pastures in a rotational grazing program. In winter when they don’t have access to fresh pasture, they’re fed sprouted barley seeds that the Glasgows grow in a specially designed greenhouse. The sprouts grow in six days and provide the cows with a good source of nutrients, energy and vitamins. The name of this bloomy-rinded cheese was inspired by the Walt Whitman poem ‘Eidolons.’ In the poem, an eidolon is the perfect form of an idea, a Platonic notion of reality; a word that, the Glasgows believe, can begin to describe the melding of elements that creates a taste of place. The cheese itself was inspired by traditional French cheeses that are also expressions of the place they’re made, such as Chaource and Coulommiers. The Grey Barn and Farm’s certified-organic version has a delicate mold growth on the surface and a rich, milky center. In production of Eidolon, fresh milk is warmed, and cultures and rennet are added before the curd is cut, gently stirred and hand-ladled into its form. Cheeses are turned several times while draining overnight in the creamery. The following morning, they’re removed from their forms and hand-salted in the brine room, where they’re then left for several days before moving into the cave. The cylinders are turned daily during four weeks of cave aging. Eidolon exhibits scents reminiscent of grass and freshly tilled earth, with aromas of mushrooms and ripened fruit closer to the delicate white rind. Paste is moist with a layer of creamy softness developing with age around a dense, cakelike center.Pair Eidolon with a crisp bubbly and sweet fruit preserves, or pair it with bold coffee in the morning, spread over some crusty bread.

Elberton Blue,Nature's Harmony,United States,Georgia,"7 in diameter, 6 in height",6-7 lbs,http://southernaged.com/,Cow,Raw,Blue,Microbial,Natural,Blue,,"In 2007, Tim and Liz Young quit their corporate careers and left behind their home in suburban Atlanta. Hoping to reconnect with the land, animals and food, they moved to rural Georgia and became first-time farmers. Tim and Liz started milking cows and making cheese in 2010. They’d originally just wanted the whey to feed their rare breed Ossabaw Island pigs, but soon fell in love with the cheesemaking process. Today they make a variety of cheeses using only raw milk from their small herd of Jersey cows. The cows graze on organic grasses and hay, and have access to outdoor pastures each day of the year. The Youngs focus on small batches of handmade cheese; milk is stirred by hand, curds are cut and hooped by hand, and aging wheels are brushed, washed, and turned by hand. Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons. Tim and Liz heat the milk to 90 degrees Farenheit, add starter cultures and a sprinkling of blue mold, and then add rennet. After cutting the curds, the Youngs bend over the vat to stir and fluff them, allowing for openness inside the cheese once it’s hooped. After hooping they flip the cheese hourly, and begin salting the following day. A few days later the wheels are pierced to allow air to interact with the blue mold. Wheels are then flipped and brushed daily until they’re ready for sale at 75-90 days. Elberton Blue is the winter version of Broad River Blue; while Broad River Blue is made in summer when cows are grazing on lush pastures, Elberton Blue is made during colder months, when the milk has a higher fat content. As a result, Elberton Blue is richer and more complex. It’s dense, fudgy, luscious and creamy.Pair Elberton Blue with a port wine or a Stout."

Elderflower Tomme hails from the Alsace region, where Fromagerie Haxaire has aged a variety of local cheeses in its caves since 1929; more recently, the company has branched out into crafting original products of its own. Although best known for its AOP Munster, Haxaire also specializes in tomme styles with creative flavor additions, from Salicornia plants to Mirabelle plum schnapps. The company’s Elderflower Tomme (also known as La Cigogne), imported to the US by Seattle-based Peterson Cheese, is flavored with the white lacy elderflowers that bloom in the French mountains during late spring each year. It’s made with pasteurized cow’s milk and aged for a minimum of four months, becoming semi-firm.Fudgy, creamy and supple, Elderflower Tomme`s paste coasts the mouth, spreading the milky, floral flavors of the cheese. Aromas are sweet and herbal, while the flavor is vegetal with savory notes of cumin, onion, mint, grass, and a slight tang.Pair Elderflower Tomme with an Alsatian white wine or a Champagne. A really good gin`s botanicals can also bring out the cheese`s floral notes, while serving it alongside a cocktail with St. Germain (also made with elderflower) is a no-brainer."

It is off the grid, and powered by solar and hydro-electric systems installed by Vern, a former career Marine.The dairy herd consists of about 30 milking goats. The Caldwells initially chose Nigerian Dwarfs for a 4H project for their young daughter (due to their managable size). Several years later, Gianaclis and Vern find themselves with one of the best herds in the country. They have worked hard on improving genetics and the goats lead a happy life, listening to National Public Radio and jazz, and grazing at pasture for as much of the year as the weather permits.Gianaclis makes cheese in a room adjacent to (but separated from) the milking parlor and the main barn. The quality of the goats` milk is outstanding and Gianclis approaches cheesemaking in a very methodical and diligent way.Formed in Roquefort basket molds, Elk Mountain is made from raw milk in the tradition of a Pyrenees-style aged tomme. Named for the elk-populated mountain where Pholia Farm is situated, cheeses are aged for six to eight months, during which time they are washed with Honey Wheat Ale, brewed by Wild River Brewery in neighboring Grant`s Pass.Not surprisingly, this process adds considerable character to the body of the cheese as well as a lovely golden color to the rind.

Emmentaler,Various,Switzerland,Various,"40 ins diameter, 6-8 ins high",225 lbs,emmentaler.ch,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,," Traditional Emmentaler is produced in several different regions of Switzerland: Aargau, Berne, Glarus, Lucerne, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Zug, Zurich and portions of Freiburg. Protected by Swiss AOC regulations, production of Emmentaler must take place within cooperative dairies using cultured raw, unfiltered cow`s milk that is sourced from within a 30km (18.6 mile) radius. Milk for production cannot come from cows that have been fed silage.Milk stored for production must not exceed 40°F, or be kept for longer than 18 hours prior to the start of cheesemaking.The best wheels are produced during summer months, when cows are outside and the quality of milk is at its peak. Emmentaler is one of the largest cheeses produced anywhere on a regular basis. Each wheel weighs approximately 225 pounds and requires about 330 gallons of milk to produce. After coagulation and cutting, curds are heated to between 125°-129°F before being put into molds and pressed for 20 hours under an increasing pressure of up to two tons. After unmolding, the wheels are brined for two days to aid formation of the rind.Cheeses are then transferred to a cellar at at a temperature of 59°-65°F for 5-20 days, before being placed in a fermentation cellar at 66°-70°F for six to eight weeks.The warmth of that cellar triggers the propionic acid fermentation process, which generates carbon dioxide. The gas is trapped in the cheese and creates the large, distinctive holes in its texture for which Emmentaler is famous.The last stage sees the cheeses thoroughly cleaned and placed in a storage cellar at 51°-57°F, where they remain until being sold. While the cheese can be sold after four months of aging, affineurs use fine-tuned selection skills to mature certain wheels for over a year, which results in a wonderful array of complex flavors.The texture of Emmentaler is very smooth and dense and velvety, punctuated by large holes.Flavors are soft, fruity and savory with a slight bite on the finish.Like most Swiss Alpine cheeses, Emmentaler is cooked into a variety of dishes; most notably, it`s grated and melted alongside Gruyère in a fondue, and served alongside a crisp white wine."

According to Workman, the copper is a critical component for the production of Emmentaler, since the milk and curds that are stirred in the vat create a reaction that leads to the desired rich, nutty flavor of the cheese.Once the curds are pressed and removed from their huge round forms, Workman and his staff hand-wash them in a salt water solution and turn them twice a week, with the help of a special revolving press.The texture of Emmentaler is very fine and dense, punctuated by large, smooth holes that comprise an essential part of the cheesemaking process. The interior paste is a pale, caramel color, becoming darker towards the rind.Flavors are mild yet complex, with notes of grass and flowers (especially wth cheeses made from summer milk), butterscotch, fruit and savory herbaceous notes."

It was also very popular at the beginning of the 20th century, but production declined and then ceased entirely during WWII. M. Berthaut, of the village of Epoisses, revived production in 1956 and although there are other excellent versions, Berthaut`s Epoisses is probably the most widely known. Epoisses was granted AOC status in 1991.Milk for production comes from the breeds of French Simmenthal, Montbeliarde and Brune cow.The coagulation process is slow and gentle, and the curd for Epoisses is handled very gently, uncooked and allowed to drain naturally. This allows for the retention of as much moisture as possible in the finished cheeses.Affinage takes place in specified areas and lasts for a minimum of four weeks. During this period, cheeses are washed repeatedly in a brine solution, then washed with wine or marc (brandy). This encourages the growth of the Bacterium Linens mold that gives the cheeses their deep, rust-colored rind, sticky exterior and astoundingly whiffy aroma!Like so many washed rind cheeses, their pungent aroma is much stronger than the interior flavor of the cheese.When ripe, the texture of Epoisses is meltingly soft and unctuous. Flavors are complex and meaty, with successive waves of sweet, salt, butter, metallic and clean milk flowing over the palate.Pairs well with a Pouilly Fuisse or Sauternes."

After settling for a time in Belgium, a small group travelled to Quebec just before the outbreak of World War I.Upon arrival, they purchased land located about 100 miles southeast of Montreal on Lake Memphremagog. With a motto of “pray and work,” the monks established apple orchards for the production of apple sauce and cider, and in 1943, constructed a cheese-making facility. Today, the Abbey produces several styles of cheese including blues, gruyère style cheeses, and Ricotta.Ermite was the first cheese that the Abbey created in 1943. Both it and the Abbey’s Bleu Benedictine are made using the same process. However, the ripening process is different, showing just how important aging is to developing the final character of the cheese.Ermite is aged for five weeks, during which time it is allowed to develop a natural rind. Just prior to release for sale, this rind is washed off, exposing the paste and ensuring the rind does not further affect the flavor and texture of the cheese. This interruption of the rind’s influence on the final cheese ensures that Ermite has its own character.Ermite has a cream colored paste with blue-green veins throughout and a slightly grainy texture that crumbles when cut into.   Flavors are of mushrooms with a bit of salt and good amount of tang at the finish."
Espresso BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,,,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. Primarily renowned for their production of hard and Italian style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facilities. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing. This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings. For production of Espresso BellaVitano, wheels of BellaVitano Gold are hand-coated with freshly-ground, roasted Italian espresso beans. Flavors of the BellaVitano are of butterscotch, cream and toasted nuts and these combine with the slightly smoky, roasted flavors on the rind to produce a cheese with breat balance and a long, lingering finish.Espresso BellaVitano pairs well with sweet pastries, bagels, chocolate and dried apricots. Good wine pairings include Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Chardonnay and Sherry. Beers include Porters and Stouts, Belgian Trappist Ales and Barley Wines."

It’s produced from May to October according to a traditional recipe, over an open fire in mountain huts. Because it’s a seasonal cheese and producers are mostly small and independent, L’Etivaz is made in small quantities; less than 20,000 wheels are produced each year. The L’Etivaz Cooperative was formed in 1932 in response to a decline in the cheese’s production. The idea was to create a common aging facility that would lift the burden of affinage from small and independent producers, helping them to survive. Today the cooperative continues to mature the cheese in caves that have continuously expanded in size. The cooperative has also worked to guarantee production quality, helping the cheese to receive AOP (Appellation of Origin) status. Cows spend their summers grazing in the high mountain pastures, where they’re milked twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Milk from the evening is left in small containers overnight. In the morning, the cheesemaker skims off the cream that has floated to the top and sets it aside. The remaining milk is then mixed with the fresh raw milk from the morning in a copper vat, inoculated with lactic acid bacteria, and warmed over an open fire to 90 degrees f. Rennet is added and the cheesemaker waits for the milk to coagulate. When it’s ready the curd is cut into fine grains by hand with a slicing tool, and the cut curd is scalded at a temperature of up to 135 degrees f. Finally a canvas cloth is slipped under to remove curds from the vat, so that they can be molded and pressed. Rubbed with salt, fresh wheels can be kept on the Alp for up to a week, after which they’re taken down to the cooperative’s caves. At the cooperative, wheels are left in salt brine for 24 hours before beginning a 5-24 month maturation process. The process sends the wheels through a successive series of caves with varying levels of temperature and humidity. The first room’s conditions encourage the formation of a crust, while the second room encourages the development micro-organisms that give the rind its orange color. The third room is where wheels spend most of their time, being washed in a brine every five days and developing a yellow-ivory color. After six months, some wheels are selected to undergo a further stage of maturation in a fourth, much les humid room, where they dry out and eventually become the “rebibes” version of L’Etivaz after a 30-month maturation.L’Etivaz AOP is ivory to light yellow in color. Flavors of the cheese vary from Alp to Alp depending on the flora eaten by the cows, but it is generally aromatic and fruity with a slight nuttiness.Pair it with a chardonnay, a Chablis or a hard cider."
Etorki,Fromagerie des Chaumes,France,"Mauléon, Basque region","10 ins diameter, 4 ins high,",10lbs,,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced at Fromagerie des Chaumes at Mauléon, in southwestern France, Etorki, which means ""origin"" in local dialect, is a Basque-style sheep`s milk cheese. Milk comes from the native, local, black- or red-faced Manech ewes, and is sourced from flocks local shepherds and dairy farmers. The Manech sheep have lived in the region for centuries and produce very high quality milk that is ideal for cheesemaking. It takes a total of six gallons of milk to produce just one wheel of Etorki. During the milking season, milk goes directly to the factory for cheesemaking. However, the shepherds still keep their hand in by making small quantities of their own cheese from the uncollected milk before and after the factory season. Production of Etorki requires the curds to be pressed but not cooked. After unmolding, cheeses are placed in a brine solution for two hours before being dried and dry salted several times during the first week. Cheeses produced at the factory are then vacuum-packed and matured at a low temperature (39°F) in order to produce a slow maturation for a period of three to six months.The texture of Etorki is smooth, supple and velvety. The color of the interior paste is a gentle, golden, ivory and there are occasional holes or slits. Aromas are earthy and sweet.Flavors are rich and sweet with notes of hazelnut and caramel, and the cheese is voluptuous on the tongue.Pair it with a rich red wine, a chardonnay, or a young muscat."
Evalon,LaClare Farms,United States,Wisconsin,"11 ins diameter, 4 ins high",12.5 lbs,www.laclarefarm.com,Goat,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"When Larry Hedrich’s grandparents settled on a Wisconsin farm in the early 1900s, they named the land “Chandoka” after their children: Charmaine, Ann, Donna and Kathy. Larry and his wife Clara moved back to that land in 2012 to expand the cheesemaking business they’d built along with four of their children who work at LaClare farms today. Evalon, a raw goat`s milk wheel named after Larry`s grandmother, is one of the most famous products of the Hedrichs’ labor. Aged between 70 and 150 days, the cooked, pressed cheese was developed when the Hedrichs first decided to make goat’s milk cheese, consulting with cheesemongers and retailers to settle on a style. Two years of developing, sampling, and tweaking their recipe paid off: Evalon continues to win awards. The does at LaClare have room to exercise and graze on pasture, and are fed whole grains and other foods that goats love. They graze on lush, green fields, and their milk gives Evalon its sweet, supple flavor. “Every piece of our operation plays into the success of this cheese,” says Katie Hedrich, Larry and Clara`s daughter and current head cheesemaker.Texture is semifirm and dense. Flavors are fruity, nutty and earthy with a lingering, balanced finish.Evalon shines with fruit-forward, semi-dry sparkling wine (hints of earth in Australian Shiraz play nicely with goat’s milk) or intensely flavored grapes. Try pairing the cheese`s fenugreek or cumin-studded varieties with charcuterie or pickled vegetables."
Ewe Bloom,Prairie Fruits Farm,,Illinois,"3 ins square, 1 in high",6-8 oz, www.prairiefruits.com,Sheep,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Located near Champagn, in southern Illinois, Prairie Fruits Farm is owned by Leslie Cooperband and Wes Jarrell, who bought it in 2005 with a view to operate a mixed use, small-scale fruit farm and goat dairy.With careers as professors within the Wisconsin and Illinois university systems, (Wes as head of Agricultural Science, and Leslie with a strong background in soil science and management) both bring a great deal of experience to farming life. Wes generally takes care of the goats and does the milking, while Leslie oversees the cheesemaking, with help from Alisa, who is Assistant Cheesemaker.The herd of Nubian and La Mancha milking goats currently numbers about 60 within a closed herd system. The milk is of extremely good quality and yields exceptionally high solids.Leslie produces several different varieties of cheese, ranging from a fresh chèvre through to a raw milk blue. Most of her sales take place at Farmers` Markets or go to select retail stores, where invariably demand exceeds supply.The most recent development is that Prairie Fruits Farm is buying a limited quantity of sheep`s milk from a local Amish dairy farmer. To that end, Leslie has started experimenting with several sheep`s milk cheeses that compliment the existing range of goat`s milk cheese.Ewe Bloom is one of Leslie`s newest creations and is made from sheep`s milk in a small square. During production, the curds are handled gently to and retain as much moisture as possible, and are allowed to drain naturally in their molds.After unmolding, cheeses are flipped three times, every ninety minutes and left to drain further overnight. The following morning they`re salted to help draw out the moisture from the cheese and aid in the development of the rind.Ewe Bloom undergoes several transformations during its maturation. At about ten days old, the rind has begun to develop and is white and bloomy in appearance, encasing a fairly firm, chalky paste inside. At three weeks, the rind is colonized by some natural, wild molds and has taken on a mottled appearance, with patches of grey and white. The interior of the cheese at this point has started to soften and break down, becoming slightly runny under the rind.However, at four weeks of age the rind takes on the appearance of a sqaure of stone with molds of grey, green and brown. The interior paste becomes almost translucent and liquid, providing a texture and flavor similar to ice cream. As a finishing touch, Leslie finishes the cheeses with a few leaves of parsley, lavender and sage that are grown at Prairie Fruits Farm.Flavors are delicate and aromatic, with the sweetness of the sheep`s milk pleasantly balanced by salt."

Both Tom and Nancy harbored a long desired to make a blue sheep’s milk cheese in the style of Roquefort. After first teaming up with a Wisconsin-based company to age the cheese, Tom and Nancy finally decided to construct a purpose-built cheesemaking room on their own land specifically for Ewe`s Blue.This semi-firm wheel is rich, creamy and moist, with a hint of piquant and tangy blue flavor.Pair it with a port or a zinfandel."

Primarily renowned for their production of hard and Italian style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facilities. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Sartori launched their limited production, Extra Aged Goat cheese in June 2012. Wheels are made from 100% pasteurized goat’s milk and aged for a minimum of 10 months before release. Flavors are mild and approachable with savory notes of cream, grass and caramel and a pleasant tang on the finish.This cheese pairs well with charcuterie and other cured meats, roast lamb and pita bread.

Creamery owner Scott Linkletter was inspired to begin making cheddar-style cheeses after a visit to the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, where he met and befriended a local cheesemaker. Produced using a cheddar recipe that Linkletter discovered on that trip, this cheese reflects the salt air and iron-rich soils of Prince Edward Island. The Holstein cow’s milk used in production is gently heated but not pasteurized, allowing beneficial microbes to thrive and give depth of character and flavor to the cheese. Blocks are aged for at least two years.Although on first glance the texture of this cheese is semi-firm and crumbly, on the palate it’s unexpectedly creamy and smooth, melting in the mouth. Its great taste hits you immediately, with a notable tang and sourness that interplays with a mild sharpness. An initial hint of sweetness can be detected, as well as rich, full toasted nut and buttery cashew aromas and notes of pineapple, chive and sweet cream.Pair Cows Creamery’s Extra Old Cheddar with a full-bodied red from Prince Edward Island, such as Marechal Foch from Rossignol Estate.

Feta (Flying Goat Farm),Flying Goat Farm,United States,Maine,,,www.flyinggoatfarmmaine.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Firm,Vegetable,None,,,"Cara Sammons and Devin Shepard produce goat’s milk cheeses out of their home in Acton, Maine, which they describe as an accidental goat dairy. They’d purchased their first goat Grace at the Fryeburg fair in 2007, only so that Cara’s horse wouldn’t be too lonely in the barn. “We just got goat with the most blue ribbons” remembers Devin, “we were just like, we want the one with the floppy ears! And the big nose!” After Cara’s horse Petey passed away in 2008, Grace was devastated, so they got another doe, Ruth, to keep her company. The experience of raising goats, especially kidding, led Cara to change the course of her life; she’s now the husbandry manager of her and Devin’s herd of more than 35. She’s also in veterinary school, conducting research on a poorly understood Nubian goat genetic disease known as the G6S mutation, sampling goat populations throughout New England. Devin, a lover of food and cooking, has become the farmstead cheesemaker after working to convert the basement of the house into a fully operational creamery. Goats are milked twice daily and cheese is made up to several times per week in season. In the future Cara and Devin hope to work with local cow dairies to produce cow’s milk cheeses and blended cheeses year-round.This is an excellent version of Feta; it’s pleasingly firm in texture while retaining a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Saltiness is of a medium intensity and doesn’t overwhelm, balancing nicely with the cheese’s acidity.Serve it alongside a glass of dry rosé."

The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. Gold Creek Farms’ Feta is aged for six to nine months in a brine solution that is made from the whey produced during the cheesemaking process. Not only does the special brine help the farm to reduce waste, says Debbie; it also helps the cheese to develop stronger flavors.This Feta is crumbly and firm in texture. Flavor is dominatedby a salty tang.Pair it with a wheat beer or, as the Golds suggest, layer it between hummus and olives."

Owned and run by Dee Harley, a native of Britain, this is the only remaining dairy in San Mateo County, a once thriving dairy region. Having originally started with six pet goats, Harley Farms is now home to over 200 American Alpine goats. The milk is transformed into farmstead cheeses daily. Harley Farms’ Feta is produced over a few weeks in batches of 50 gallons of milk. More cultures and rennet are added than in the production of the farm’s fresh chèvres, and batches are held at a different temperature. After the milk curdles into a kind of thick yogurt, cheesemakers cut out one-inch squares, which are then left to drain for 30 minutes. Curds are hand-stirred gently to release a bit more whey, then pressed in stainless steel baskets overnight. The following day, cheesemakers cut the curds into two-pound blocks, which are then salted and placed in a cooler for two days to dry. Blocks are stored in buckets of 25% salt brine over two months. Just before release they’re stored for a few days in a 4% brine to relieve some of the salt.Definitely on the salty side when compared with other fetas, the initial kick of saltiness in this chalky-textured yet fondant cheese melts into a beautifully savory, complex flavor. We’re reminded of fresh cream and seawater, and bitter, buttery notes linger.Pair it with a Chenin Blanc, a rosé or a Hefeweizen."

After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today, Maplebrook Farm is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. It employs around 20 cheesemakers, who are each trained in old world cheesemaking techniques. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Mike still is the head cheesemaker for the majority of their cheeses, but as of 2010 now has help from Domenico Marchitelli, who makes the Burrata and Scamorza. Domenico hails from Puglia, Italy, the birthplace of Burrata.The Whole Milk feta produced by Maplebrook Farm is made from cow’s milk rather than the traditional sheep and goat’s milk cheese.

Solandt grew up in France in the town of Montauban, where his grandmother owned a creamery. His father worked for Tempé-Lait before starting his own business representing French cheese manufacturers to various export markets including the USA. It was the dominance of the cheese market in the US that persuaded Solandt’s father to move his family out to the United States in 1983.

Feta PDO,Various,Greece,Various,,,,SheepGoat,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,Animal,Rindless,,,"The poster child of Mediterranean brined cheeses, feta is famous. Homer waxed poetic about it in The Odyssey. Eaten at almost every Greek meal, it’s the reason that Greece ranks among the top cheese-consuming countries in the world. And it’s even been the subject of international trade and trademark disputes. While similar cheeses exist throughout the world, PDO-certified Feta is Feta with a capital F, because the name of the cheese is protected in both Greece and the E.U. Its PDO protection was solidified in 2002 after years of dispute between Greece and other EU countries, several of whom argued that the name ‘feta’ had become generic. Greek makers, however, banded together to prove that their traditional version had specific qualities. The PDO was established to protect their traditional recipe, which requires a minimum of 70 percent sheep’s milk and up to 30 percent goat’s milk. Formed into large blocks, Feta is aged in a brine for weeks to months. It’s an ideal method of aging in sweltering climes, where rapid acceleration of mold growth, spoilage, and surface cracking are highly problematic for cheesemakers. Brining has long represented a solution to the problem, inhibiting bacterial growth through an acidic environment. Today some producers still age the blocks in wooden barrels, which imparts unique flavors to the cheese.PDO versions of feta vary depending on milk source, pasteurization, and aging method, but overall you can expect a crumbly-yet-creamy texture, a briny saltiness, and a citrusy tang. In contrast to feta imitations found throughout the world, PDO Feta often yields greater complexity and a more pungent bite.Feta can be paired with an almost endless range of ingredients, from olive oil to octopus—but we love it best alongside watermelon and washed down with rosé."

The company’s story begins in 1979 when Sara Sweetser purchased eleven acres together with an old homestead on Barton Creek with a view to raising her daughters. The land had fomerly been a working tomato farm in the 1930′s and Sara’s appreciation of well-tilled soil led to a productive vegetable garden. While taking care of a friend’s goats, Sara fell in love. Her affection for animals resulted in the acquisition of various pets together with a small herd of dairy goats. Shortly afterwards, inspired by tasting another friend’s cheeses, Sara started to experiment with making her own. About ten years later, Sara and her husband Denny were one of the first farms in Texas to file the necessary paperwork with the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) as a “Certified Organic Farm.” Sara came up with the farm name, decalring it was “Pure Luck that it worked”! The batches of cheese that Sara made for family and friends were so well received that in 1995, she made the major transition to start a Grade A Goat Dairy. Since then, Pure Luck’s dedication to quality and the family’s love for the goats have resulted in several national cheese honors. Although tragically, Sara died in 2005, her passion and love of the farm remains with her family, with her daughter Amelia heading the cheesemaking operation. Pure Luck Farm’s version of Feta is inspired by the family’s Greek heritage. Amelia recalls it being the first cheese she learned to make at a young age and it remains a firm favorite. For production, pasteurized goat’s milk is cultured at 90°F and then allowed to ripen and coagulate with the addition of microbial rennet. The curd is then cut into 3/4 inch squares and is very gently and occasionally stirred over the course of one hour. After the whey is drained off, the curd is transferred into molds and left overnight. After unmolding, the newly formed cheeses are placed in a light brine for one month.The texture of Pure Luck’s Feta is crumbly and moist with a bright white color throughout. Flavors are rich and cream-like with a slightly salty tang and a clean finish – all of which make it an ideal and versatile option in the kitchen."

And the does love to be brought to the edge of the woods to “browse” the vines and pines, an interest that Krabbe and Spann are happy to indulge. This farmstead cheese is the fruit of all that careful pampering. Made in a French bloomy-rind style, the discs are rubbed with a mix of herbs and spices before being allowed to develop a fuzzy white rind. The herb and spice mix—rosemary, juniper berries, fennel, thyme, tellicherry pepper, red pepper flakes— is an instant transport to the breezy hillsides of Provençal France.While the rind is wrinkly and fuzzy, the herbs poking through that bloomy mold hint at the aromatic experience to follow. Paste is bone-white, bright and creamy-looking, while aromas upfront are of freshly mown grass, lavender and yogurt. Flavor is mild, grassy, herbal and bright, leaving enough room for the aromas of those herbs to shine through.Owners Krabbe and Spann suggesting pairing Field of Creams with charcuterie.

She was inspired early on by watching her grandfather Joe, who had taken over Alphonso’s shop, making mozzarella, ricotta and basket cheese. Her business in Somerville, Massachusetts, whose name translates into “my grandfather’s flower,” is a salute to him. Lourdes sources mozzarella curd from partner farms. She recently worked with Shy Brothers Farm in Westport, MA, which is run by two sets of fraternal twins, to develop a curd recipe using their antibiotic and hormone-free cow’s milk. Shy Brothers’ cows graze on pasture in a peninsula that juts out into the Westport River. After Lourdes receives the curd, she transforms it by hand each morning in her Somerville, MA kitchen. The cheesemaking process begins by breaking the curd into even pieces using a tool called a guitar. Lourdes then adds hot water to the curd, which slowly brings it up to melting temperature so that it can be stretched using a wooden paddle, then shaped.The resulting mozzarella is moist and refreshing, soft in texture, milky and buttery with a hint of salt. Burrata originated in the Murgia area of Italy. It’s a disk of fresh mozzarella that is shaped into a pouch, inside of which is stuffed stracciatella, a mix of fresh cream, salt and curds that have been pulled into strings. Fiore di Nonno Burrata is made in several unique combinations that play with sweetness, savory and tangy flavors. The Fig Burrata is filled with Italian mascarpone, some Greek yogurt and a sweet Turkish fig jam.Lourdes suggests serving Fig Burrata with a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar."
Figaro,Andante Dairy,United States,California,"3 ins diameter, 1 in high",6 oz, www.andantedairy.com,CowGoat,,Soft,Microbial,Leaf Wrapped,,,"Established in 1999, Andante Dairy is owned and operated by Soyoung Scanlan. The creamery is located at the Volpi Ranch near Petaluma, just north of San Francisco, California, which is also the source for Scanlan`s goat`s milk. Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three. Made only seasonally at the end of the California fig season, Figaro is a produced with a blend of cow`s and goat`s milk.The interior is finely textured and reminiscent of a fresh cheese, with a beautiful goaty tang and bright, citrus flavors. The exterior is wrapped in a fig leaf that imparts a delicate, coconut flavor to the cheese."
Fiore Sardo,Various,Italy,Sardinia,Drum,6-7 lbs,,Sheep,,Hard,Animal,Smoked,,,"Sometimes referred to as Pecorino Sardo, Fiore Sardo is produced on the island of Sardinia off the coast of Italy. This is a cheese with very ancient origins, thought by some to date back to the Bronze Age. Partly as a result of this, Fiore Sardo was awarded DOP (name protected) status in 1996. Although there are now industrially produced variations of Fiore Sardo that are sometimes made from a blend of cow`s and sheep`s milk or even pasteurized milk, traditionally Fiore Sardo is made from fresh, unpasteurized sheep`s milk, sourced from native Sardinian sheep from a single flock. These versions are made in small mountain huts - known as ""pinnette"" - by the shepherds that look after these flocks. The natural smoke from the hut`s central, open fires give these cheeses their characteristically smoky overtones. For production, raw milk from one milking is poured into a cheese vat. (Originally, the shepherds would have used a wooden tub and the vat is the only concession to modern technology.) The milk is coagulated with animal rennet and the soft curd cut with a knife called a ""chinova"". The curd is left to drain and then cut again with a special knife known as a ""sa sega casu"". At this point, the curd is transferred to cheese molds, each one officially described as ""two truncated cones joined at their wider base, whose diameter is inferior to the diameter of the cheese in its center"". The molds containing the cheeses are briefly immersed in hot water to help develop the thick outer rind. They are then unmolded and placed in a brine solution. After removal from the brine, the cheeses are placed on a trellis-type mat made of rushes which is suspended in the smoky area above the fireplace in the mountain hut. The second stage of maturation takes place when the wheels are transferred to a platform in the roof before finally being finished in an underground cellar for the last stages of maturation. In the cellar, the wheels are periodically turned (flipped) and greased with olive oil to prevent the rind cracking. Cheeses are matured for between two and eight months before release. The texture of the outer rind of Fiore Sardo is dry and hard and, depending on age, a pale golden-rust color or a deep rich burnt brown. The texture of the cheese is very firm and dense and straw-ivory in color. Flavors are sweet, rich and nut-like with notes of burned caramel, smoke and salt."

The milk from Brown Swiss cows is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking.Throughout the year Traders Point milks 60-90 cows each day, and additional milk is purchased from a sister farm in southern Indiana. Both farms are certified organic.Production of fresh cheeses and yogurt began in 2003, when Traders Point sold cheese direct to customers from their small store, and made local deliveries.In 2005, Fons Smits, a native of Holland and experienced cheesemaker, joined the business. Drawing on recipes that he had introduced during his time as cheesemaker in Holland and at Cowgirl Creamery, in California, Fons expanded the range of offerings at Traders point.Traders Point now produces a wide range of fresh cheeses, including Fromage Blanc, Cottage Cheese, creamline whole milk (sold in glass bottles), chocolate milk, and European-style yogurts. Traders Point also produces an aged gouda called Fleur de la Terre.Developed by Fons Smits to a gouda recipe from his native Holland, Fleur de la Terre is a gently aged cheese with a creamy yet firm texture.Milk for production of this cheese comes from the cows that are grazing on the property`s pastures, rich with herbs and grasses.Encased in a natural rind, the interior paste is smooth, firm and slightly flaky, with small holes.Flavors of the cheese are mild, sweet, nutty and herbacous with buttery notes and a distinctive tang."

The Baetjes keep a large herd of Saanen dairy goats, and produce cheese along with several employees. The day`s milking begins each morning at 4 am, and the rest of the day is spent turning that milk into cheese, shipping cheese, handling sales calls and making local deliveries. Goats receive an unlimited supply of filtered spring water to drink from the farm’s spring, and their diet—an all-natural antibiotic-free whole grain ration—is supplemented with organic herbal teas, mineral supplements, locally grown alfalfa hay, and the farm’s pasture. The milking season begins with the birth of spring kids and each doe receives a rest in the winter, giving the goats a break for several months a year. Made from a mix of sheep and goat’s milk—and sometimes in a 100 percent goat`s milk version—Fleur de la Vallee is a semi-soft cheese with a washed rind. In making the cheese, curd is cut and lightly pressed, rounds are brined, and then washed, turned, and flipped on racks for at least four weeks.Flavor is complex and full-bodied, reminiscent of toasted bread with butter, meaty bacon and eggs, and faint notes of toasted onion. The aroma is also rich with notes of fermented wheat, barley, hops and yeast, and a slight sweetness.Pair it with a barbera, a merlot, or a hoppy beer."

This cheese also goes by ""Brin d`Amour,"" meaning ""a breath of love."" The sheep freely browse Corsica`s scrubby, Mediterranean landscape and during production, to enhance the natural flavors present in the milk, the small cheeses are encrusted with rosemary, fennel seeds, juniper berries, and the occasional bird`s eye chile. When young, Fleur du Maquis is firm and moist, with citrus flavors and a slightly sour tang. With age the rind becomes dotted with a blue-grey mold. The texture of the cheese also becomes softer, absorbing the savory and herbaceous flavors of the rind.Flavors strike a delicate balance with the herbs, enhancing the warm, bright, sheepy quality of the interior paste. If allowed to mature fully, the paste breaks down and becomes runny and stronger tasting.This cheese pairs well with many types of wines, particularly tempranillo and albarino. It`s fun to experiment alongside honeys, too; try it with a thyme honey or a floral honey from Corsica."

They were among the first people in the United States to start producing goat’s milk cheeses and at a time - the early 1980’s - when such products were not only unavailable, but unheard of. Over the course of the last thirty years, they consciously decided to keep their production small, focusing on making high quality cheeses that are sold to specific local outlets as well as at the Madison Farmers Market. Cheeses made at Fantôme Farm are all produced using a process of lactic fermentation which results in a particularly fine, delicate texture in the end product. This means that after a minimal amount of mesophilic cultures and rennet are added, the goat’s milk is allowed to ripen for a period of approximately 18 hours, at which point is has formed a gel-like curd. The curd is then ladled gently into molds and allowed to drain under its own weight for 24 hours before being coated lightly with salt and charcoal on day three.Fleurie Noir has an extremely delicate rind that is grey and white in color and has a wrinkled texture. The interior paste is bone white and very finely textured. Flavors are clean, bright and lactic with notes of citrus and crème-fraiche and a balanced acidity.Fleurie Noir pairs beautifully with a white Sauvignon wine."

Flora (Capriole),Capriole Goat Cheese,United States,Indiana,3 x 2,6 oz,https://www.capriolegoatcheese.com/,Goat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Geotricum,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to rind,"This bloomy-rind goat`s milk cheese is the newest from the Indiana-based Capriole Goat Cheese. Surface-ripened and with a wrinkly, white Geotrichum candidum rind, Flora has a creamy texture and delicate flavor.When it`s young, the cheese is light in flavor and texture. Beneath the rind, Flora has a layer of vegetable ash. While the ash itself is flavorless, but helps development of both the rind and the cream line. Flavors intensify and become more complex as Flora ripens over the course of 7-10 days. Over this time, it goes from light and fluffy to more dense and with a noticeable cream line. Flora is named after Capriole founder Judy Schad`s grandmother, who made cheeses from a neighbor`s herd of cows. Schad is among the small handful of cheesemakers in the United States who were at the forefront of the farmstead cheese revolution, and she has vastly contributed to shaping the movement`s future. Schad has been making cheese since 1976, when she and her husband moved with their three young children from the suburbs to a farm in southern Indiana. They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm, they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great-great-grandfather in the 1870s. These days, Capriole produces about a dozen different goat`s milk cheeses across a wide spectrum of styles.As Flora ripens, it develops from grassy and light to dense, creamy, and rich in flavor.Pair younger, lighter versions of Flora with floral saisons, rosé, or wheat ales, and serve with berry jams. With more mature versions, opt for stronger pairings like olives, charcuterie, or dark chocolate, and sup moscato, sancerre, or sauternes."

Initially they sold goat`s milk until 1979, when local goat cheese maker Regis Du Sartre decided to retire and Kevin and Alison were able to buy some of his recipes, as well as his herd of goats.They now own 240 milking goats, including British Saanen, Toggenburg and Alpine, and make a small, high quality selection of goat cheeses.The development and recipe for Flower Marie came from a collaboration with well known cheesemaker James Aldridge. The name `Flower Marie` comes from the anglisized version of the Corsican sheep cheese `Fleur de Maquis`.The Blunts buy unpasteurized sheep`s milk from a herd of Friesland-Dorset sheep located at a farm in Essex where the sheep are fed on grass, hay and maize silage.Coagulation of the curd for Flower Marie is a slow, lactic set taking about 18 hours. The curd is ladled by hand to conserve as much moisture as possible before being put into the distinctive cube shaped molds to drain. After unmolding, cheeses are brined before being transferred to maturing rooms for about three weeks, prior to release. Some cheeses are aged further so they might be up to weeks of age at the time of consumption.The rind of Flower Marie is bloomy white, tinged with pink. The interior paste of the cheese is ivory-white in color, with a meltingly soft texture, reminiscent of ice cream when ripe.Flavors are aromatic, sweet and slightly mushroomy with a subtle, citrus-like tang."
Flösserkäse,Käserei Kramershaus,Switzerland,Bern,"3” tall, 14” diameter",13 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Founded in 1868, Kaserei Kramershause was originally a traditional producer of Emmentaler. In 1993, the kaserei was purchased by Walter and Christa Zaugg who found it increasingly difficult to compete solely in the Emmentaler market. While reading a history of the cheese, Walter learned that Emmentaler was at one point transported in beer barrels via riverboats in order to avoid tax collectors. He was inspired to experiment with the idea of washing a cheese in beer. During his experimentations he found that when he not only washed the cheese in the beer, but also rubbed the rind with hops, that the cheese’s character totally changed. Thus was born Flösserkäse. This cheese is a raw cow’s milk cheese with a bright orange rind dotted with hops. It is an aromatic cheese with a smooth ivory to light yellow colored paste that has a smooth texture with a nice snap when bitten into. Its flavor is complex with roasted peanut and floral notes. Flösserkäse pairs very well with ales and a most white wines. It can also be paired successfully with medium-bodied red wines. It is great when served with darker honeys, such as buckwheat honey.This cheese is a raw cow’s milk cheese with a bright orange rind dotted with hops.

Fontina (Danish),Denmark's Tradition,Denmark,Vejle,"12 ins diameter, 3.5 ins high",15 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Waxed,,,"The origins of Fontina date back to the Middle Ages in Italy when, according to tradition, the recipe is said to have been given to the early inhabitants of the Val d`Aosta region by a near-mythical man called Sarvadzo. Sarvadzo taught the people how to make what we now know as Fontina val d`Aosta, an unpasteurized, whole milk cheese, that is matured in caves for at least three months before its release. Such is the cheese’s popularity that it has been extensively copied elsewhere, and although versions made outside the original region cannot be called Fontina val d`Aosta, several excellent Fontina type cheeses are on the market. One version is made in Denmark by a company called Denmark’s Tradition. Inspired by the Italian version, this Danish Fontina has a milder and more cream-like flavor and it is aged for less time than the Italian version. The resulting cheese is semi-soft in texture and pliable. Denmark’s Tradition was very recently founded in 2010 with the specific aim of revisiting some classic Danish cheeses and re-introducing a more artisan and handmade approach. The company works with just two dairies, located near Copenhagen. Danish Fontina is a round, red-waxed wheel that is made from pasteurized cow’s milk.The interior paste has a few scattered holes.  Aromas are delicately milky  while the flavor is distinctly butter with a tangy finish.  Danish Fontina’s semi-firm texture makes for an ideal melting and cooking cheese."

Formaggio al Tartufo,Caseificio Bertagni ,Italy,Tuscany,"4 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",1 lb,www.caseificiobertagni.com,Sheep,,Flavor AddedSemi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Made by Caseificio Bertagni near Pieve Fosciana in the province of Lucca, Italy, Formaggio al Tartufo is a medium-aged sheep’s milk cheese, studded with pieces of black truffle. Milk for production comes from the (somewhat rare) breeds of Massese and Garfagnina sheep and is sourced from seventeen small farms, located high in the mountains between Northern Toscana and Emilia Romagna. This mountain range is known as ""Appennino Tosco Emiliano"" and the majority of the farms are situated at an altitude of over 3,000 feet. Caseificio Bertagni is owned and run by Bruno Bertagni and his son Verano. Although they make a variety of cheeses, the inspiration for Formaggio al Tartufo came from a desire to create a cheese made with black truffles that could be used not only as a table cheese but also a wonderful ingredient in dishes such as pasta and polenta. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized at 161-165° F (72-74°C) for 15 seconds. It is then allowed to cool to 95-104° F (35-40°C), when the starter cultures are added. After a short period of waiting to allow the cultures to become fully active, rennet is added to coagulate the milk. This normally takes about 40 minutes, at which point the curd is cut with a special cheese “harp” (known as a “chitarra”), and left to rest for 10 minutes, soaking in the whey. The curd is further broken down with a special implemt called a “spino” – the same instrument that is used for the production of Parmigiano Reggiano – which looks rather like a giant balloon whisk on the end of a pole. Simultaneously, the curds and whey are re-heated and cooked at a temperature of 107°F (42 °C ). At the end of this process, each piece of curd is about the size of a hazlenut. The whey is drained off and the pieces of black truffle are added to the curd. (The truffles are preserved in brine until they’re ready for use to prevent them from drying out.) The curd is then transferred into molds and held at a temperature of 100° F (38°C) for 3 to 4 hours in order to achieve the correct pH. When it has reached 5.4, the cheeses are dry salted by hand and, the following day, taken out of their molds. The young wheels are then transferred to a maturing room where they’re held at a temperature of 46-50° F (8-10°C) for a minimum of 30-40 days before release. The format of Formaggio al Tartufo is quite small, weighing in at about 1lb. The exterior rind is thin and slightly waxy and pale yellow in color. The interior paste is semi-soft and supple, ivory white in color and studded with flecks of black truffle. Flavors are delicate and mild. The rich characteristics of the sheep’s milk enhance the flavors of truffle, but both are kept in balance, complimenting each other. Aromas are of earth, hay and truffle."
Formai de Mut,,Italy,Bergamo,"14 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",18-26 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Fomai de Mut is produced in the upper Val Brembana in the Bergamo region of northern Italy. The word ""Mut"" literally means ""mountain"" in the local dialect, and in this instance refers to the the Alps. Formai de Mut is protected by Italian DOP regulations.The production of the cheeses takes place in approximately 40 mountain dairies, known as ""casere."" The best quality cheeses are made in the summer months when the cows are grazing the upland pastures at an elevation of between 4,200 - 8,200ft. During the winter months cows are fed additional rations of corn and silage, all of which are required to have been grown in the same area that the cows graze during the summer.Made from raw cow`s milk, Formai de Mut, like many Alpine style-cheeses, is cooked and pressed, resulting in a dense, closely textured and firm cheese with occasional holes or ""eyes.""Rearing cattle has been the main economic staple for well over 500 years in the mountains above the Brembana valley. However, the production of Formai de Mut increased considerably during the1950`s when a group of farmers set up a small dairy which they operated in shifts. For years, the dairy processed milk for five months of the year, and it was not until 1988 that the dairy began to produce the cheese all year round.Cheeses are then matured for at least 45 days before release.The texture of Fomai de Mut is a firm, dense and smooth, with occasional holes, and is a rich golden yellow color.Flavors are savory, vegetal and sweet with traces of animals and grass."
Formatge Blau del Net,Formatges Camps,Spain,Catalonia,8 in diameter x 5 in height,6.6 lbs,www.formatgescamps.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Brothers Toni and Robert Camps founded Formatges Camps in 2000 near Lleida, Spain, to diversify their family’s agricultural business, and to focus on the artisanal production of sheep and goat cheeses. In Spain, many traditional cheeses enjoy Denominación de Origen status, but most are from outside Catalonia. “In Catalonia there’s no typical cheese,” says Robert, “so cheesemakers here try to make original and different cheeses from what is on the market.” There had never been a blue cheese from Catalonia until 20 years ago; Robert and Toni’s goat-milk version was the second, and Blau del Nèt, their award-winning sheep’s milk version, is the third. The Camps brothers, now making 12 different cheeses, are at the forefront of a diversification of the region’s cuisine. “Now in Catalonia there is a range of cheese so varied,” says Robert, “I believe that the Catalan cheesemakers have no reason to envy the famous French!” The firm cheese is made from raw ewe’s milk inoculated with Penicilliumroquefortispores, which produce a greenish-blue mold that flourishes in air channels the brothers create. After a month in cellars, the wheels are wrapped in foil and ripened in cool storage for at least another month.A buttery-textured cheese with a natural rind and delicate blue veins of mold, Blau del Nèt has a creamy taste that’s slightly spicy, but that lacks the itching pungency of some blue cheeses. “It’s suitable for those who fear the blue cheese,” says Robert, “and who want to learn them.”Pair it with a Riesling or a Merlot."
Fortsonia,Nature's Harmony Farmstead Cheese,United States,Georgia,"12 in diameter, 3.5 in height",10-12 lbs. ,www.naturesharmonyfarm.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"In 2007, Tim and Liz Young quit their corporate careers and left behind their home in suburban Atlanta. Hoping to reconnect with the land, animals and food, they moved to rural Georgia and became first-time farmers.Tim and Liz started milking cows and making cheese in 2010. They’d originally just wanted the whey to feed their rare breed Ossabaw Island pigs, but soon fell in love with the cheesemaking process. Today they make a variety of cheeses using only raw milk from their small herd of Jersey cows. The cows graze on organic grasses and hay, and have access to outdoor pastures each day of the year.The Youngs focus on small batches of handmade cheese; milk is stirred by hand, curds are cut and hooped by hand, and aging wheels are brushed, washed, and turned by hand. Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons.Fortsonia is an Alpine-style cheese inspired by Comté and Gruyère.During production the curd is cut, heated to almost 130 degrees Fahrenheit, and then pressed under its whey prior to draining. After being molded, it’s pressed overnight, brined, and moved to an aging facility. The Youngs then periodically brush and turn the wheels, sometimes for a year or more.Fortsonia comes in a few different variations: standard Fortsonia, aged 6 months or less; Fortsonia Reserve, aged 10 months or more; and Twisted Fortsonia, which is hand bathed in late harvest Scuppernong wine several times a week, and aged for a minimum of 4 months.While aging Fortsonia becomes firm and dense, with nutty and sweet flavors, particularly notes of caramel and hazelnut. The longer it ages, the more nutty and complex the flavors become. Sweet and nutty Fortsonia is versatile and pairs well with many wines, including Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah, or Zinfandel. For a beer pairing, try a witbier spiced with coriander or orange, or a Geuze-style Lambic. "
Fougerus,Rouzaire,France,Ile de France,"6 ins diameter,  1.5 ins high",1.5 lbs,,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,,,"Produced in Ile de France, in northern France, Fougerus is a mold ripened cow`s milk cheese named for the dried fern that graces its surface.The creation of Fougerus came about more by chance than design. Robert Rouzaire (who also invented Pierre Robert and Jean Grogne), was trying to perfect a new cheese, and,frustrated with a persistent flaw on the white, flossy rind, placed a dried fern on top to hide the blemish. The word for fern or bracken in French is ""fougere.""Rouzaire is the sole producer of Fougerus. Milk is sourced from 20 local farms located in the Seine-et-Marne region south of Paris.Production is similar to Coulommiers. After pasteurization and coagulation the curd is gently hand-ladled into the molds to drain, thereby helping to retain as much moisture as possible. After being unmolded, the young cheeses are inoculated with the culture Penicillium candidum that gives the cheese its white, bloomy rind.Cheeses are dried for a few days before being transferred to maturing rooms, where they spend the next three or four weeks. The purely decorative fern fronds that are placed on each cheese just prior to its release are gathered from the Loire Valley.Fougerus has a slight aroma of cellar and mushrooms. The exterior rind is white and bloomy, and the mold should not have grown over the fern too much.The interior paste is a beautiful, straw-colored yellow and has occasional holes, or ""eyes."" When ripe, the interior will be runny and smooth.In terms of flavor, Fougerus is balanced, with a buttery and creamy mouthfeel. There are distinct flavors of earth, mushrooms and nuts, complemented by savory vegetal notes.Fougerus pairs well with Champagne or Prosecco."
Fourme au Sauternes,Jacquy Cange,Belgium,,"4 ins high, 5 ins diameter",2.5 lbs,,Cow,,Blue,Animal,WashedNatural,,,"Produced in Belgium, production of Fourme au Sauternes was developed by affineur Jacquy Cange and is inextricably related to its sister cheese, Fourme d`Ambert.In order to make Fourme au Sauternes, Monsieur Cange (who has worked for more than 20 years at mastering the art of creating new cheeses and developing the perfect affinage for each) cuts cylinders of Fourme d`Ambert horizontally in half and proceeds to both inject and wash the half wheels with Sauternes before maturing them for two months.Sauternes is a region of Bordeaux and well known for its superior dessert wines. Primarily made with the Semillon grape, Sauternes is renowned for its its smooth, viscous texture and notes of fruit and vanilla.The liaison of Sauternes with the smooth, creamy texture and balanced blue flavors of Fourme d`Ambert is fantastic.The resulting cheese is an incredibly smooth, yet complex blue with a beautifully balanced lingering finish."
Fourme d'Ambert,Various,France,Auvergne,"5 ins diameter, 8 ins high",4-5 lbs,,Cow,Raw,BlueSemi Soft,Animal,Natural,Blue,,"Fourme d`Ambert is one of France`s oldest cheeses. Made from cow`s milk, its production dates from the Roman occupation of France 1,000 years ago, when it was reportedly made by mountain-dwellers in the lush, green, volcanic Auvergne region. There is also an unmistakable 9th-century image of Fourme d`Ambert carved in stone at La Chaume. Today, production of Forme d`Ambert can be either cooperative or artisanal and the name is protected by AOC regulations that were granted in 1976. Milk for production comes from herds of cows that graze on either the lower or higher mountain pastures, depending on the time of year. Curds are packed into molds by hand and treated very gently during production in order to retain as much moisture as possible. Maturation takes a minimum of 40 days from production, but cheeses are usually aged two to three months. Almost twice as tall as it is wide, Fourme d`Ambert is produced in a cylindrical shape.The interior paste is cream-colored and is marked with plentiful blue veining. The texture is slightly more open and creamier than Stilton, which makes it more yielding on the tongue. Flavors are smooth, forward and very balanced. There are distinct notes of butter and cream that complement the spicy blue mold.Fourme d`Ambert is a very wine-friendly cheese. It goes well with Sauternes and other dessert wines, but also some full bodied reds such as Rhones, pinot noirs and syrahs. A little drizzle of honey is also a great addition."

French Quarter,Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse,United States,South Carolina,4 in diameter x 2.5 in height,14-16 oz,www.charlestoncheesehouse.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to pasteFlavor added to rind,"Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse crafts and ages a range of cheeses on location in Charleston, South Carolina. Since 2014 the creamery has been owned by chefs Greg Tatis and Monica Jaramillo, who specialize in recipe development and cheesemaking, as well as by Pete and Heather Holmes, who specialize in sales and marketing. The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw and thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. French Quarter is a flavored version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park. Described as a cross between a brie and a farm cheese, the production process for these these bloomy-rinded discs is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling. In making flavored versions such as this, Charleston’s cheesemakers often experiment with adding ingredients to the curd as well as on the surface; in this case, infused olive oil is added to the curds, and Herbes de Provence are rubbed on the surface. The herbal blend is specially formulated for this cheese by The Charleston Spice Company. Discs are aged from three to four weeks.According cheesemaker Greg Tatis, the infused olive oil changes the viscosity of the cheese and adds flavor, while the with Herbes de Provence topping intensifies the aromas that are already incorporated in. The final effect is an infusion of herbal flavor into a mild cheese with notes of grass, butter, and fresh milk.Pair it with a Pinot Noir or with an amber ale."
Fresh Cheddar Curds (Silvery Moon Creamery),Silvery Moon Creamery,United States,Maine,,8 oz or 4 lbs,www.silverymooncheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,HerbedRindless,Fresh,Flavor added to rind,"Silvery Moon Creamery is located at Smiling Hill Farm near Portland, Maine, which has been in the Knight family since the 1700s. The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt, who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” Silvery Moon Creamery produces these fresh cheddar curds using milk that is gently batch pasteurized – at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer – in an effort to preserve the integrity of the farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. Milk is then cultured and renneted, and when a curd forms, it is cut. After cutting the vat is gently heated and curd is “cooked” to promote the expulsion of more whey. After stirring, the curds form together in a kind of mass, which is then cut into slabs for the “cheddaring” process. Slabs are turned and monitored for their increasing acidity and changing texture before they’re milled into smaller curds, and salt is mixed in. At this point, the curd can be formed into wheels and pressed to make an aged cheddar, but in this case the curds are packaged fresh. The curds are sold plain or in two other flavor variations. The French Herbed version is marinated in extra virgin olive oil with chives, parsley, basil, tarragon, rosemary and marjoram. The Tuscan Herbed version is marinated in extra virgin olive oil, parsley, red pepper flakes and garlic.Served plain, these Cheddar Curds are soft and plushy with a buttery, creamy mild flavor. The French Herbed version is soft, sweet and flavorful, with pronounced flavors of the herbs and notes of cinnamon. The Tuscan Herbed version is very garlicky, and the pepper flakes add a flavorful kick of spice.Cheesemaker Dorothee Grimm suggests that readers follow the example of several local restaurants: use any variety of this cheese in the famous Quebecois dish known as poutine. Sprinkle the curds over french fries topped with gravy, and voila!"

For years the company has been managed by its president Arnaud Solandt and cheesemaker Jean Rossard, both of whom have a strong background in the dairy business. Solandt grew up in France in the town of Montauban, where his grandmother owned a creamery. His father worked for Tempé-Lait before starting his own business representing French cheese manufacturers to various export markets, including the US. It was the dominance of the cheese market in the US that persuaded Solandt’s father to move his family stateside in 1983. Jean Rossard also grew up in France surrounded by cheese. His father was a cheesemaker and his babysitter was the truck driver who collected the milk for his father–often with Jean in the seat beside him. Today Montchevre is one of the country`s top goat cheese manufacturers; in 2017, the company was purchased by Canadian dairy company Saputo Inc. Milk is sourced from mixed-breed goats located at over 300 farms across Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri. These fresh logs, sold in 13 different flavor combinations, are the staple of the Montchevre business. They were also the first non-GMO goat cheeses certified by the National Sanitation Foundation.The texture of the chevre is light and fluffy, while flavor is delicately creamy with a slight tang. Since they are vacuum packed, high moisture content and clean flavor is maintained. Available in a variety of flavors such as Fresh and Natural, Four Peppers, Mediterranean Herb and Garlic, Sundried Tomato and Basil, Fig and Olive, Peppadew, Lemon, Honey, and Cranberry Cinnamon, these goat cheeses are highly versatile for use in an array of different recipes.Enjoy with a glass of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay or a chilled Red Ale beer."

In the process of searching for a good milk source in order to begin making cheese, they found that they were unable to get the quality that they wanted. So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced. Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012. Chapel Hill’s Fresh Mozzarella is made from the pasteurized milk of Jersey cows. Each oval of cheese is formed by pulling the curds, a method that is rather like stretching pizza dough until it is able to mold into an spherical shape. The color is butter yellow, a result of Chapel Hill’s cows grazing on grass. This Mozzarella’s flavor is clean and lactic. The texture is toothsome, but more delicate than expected from the sturdy cheese typically used on pizzas. Pair this cheese with a light, dry white wine such as Pinot Gris. Fresh Mozzarella can be used in a number of ways, including a classic Caprese Salad or sliced thinly to top a pizza."

Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese (Coturnix),Coturnix Creamery,United States,Colorado,,4 oz,www.coturnixcreamery.com,Sheep,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,,Fresh,,"In the town of Windsor in Northern Colorado, Caille Gash produces sheep’s milk cheeses under the Coturnix Creamery label, which she sells (along with fresh cow’s milk, ice cream and cheeses) at her Cozy Cow Dairy store. Caille remembers first being inspired to make cheese as a 10-year-old girl, looking through a window into a cheesemaking facility during a tour with her family. Today visitors can do the same at Cozy Cow Dairy. Milk for Coturnix Creamery cheeses is sourced from Irish Cream Sheep Dairy, located just over the border in Bushnell, Nebraska. The small farm has been owned and operated by the Halligan family for 30 years. The Halligans originally raised sheep, cattle and alfalfa, but in 2005 decided to diversify and start milking their ewes. Since then, the focus has been on building numbers and managing dairy genetics, and production has been increasing each year. This fresh sheep’s milk cheese is produced in both plain and za’atar-flavored versions.Fresh and minty aromas on the outset yield a bright, tangy flavor with notes of hay, onion and herbs. Crumbly in appearance, the cheese melts into soft, creamy clouds on the palate, with a texture reminiscent of a cross between cream cheese and sour cream. While sheepy farmstead overtones are generally absent, a minor earthiness is detectable in the background.Pair it with a Sauvignon Blanc."
Friesago,Shepherd's Way Farms,United States,Minnesota,"9 ins diameter, 3 ins high",8 lbs,www.shepherdswayfarms.com,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Chymosin,Natural,,,"In 1995, Steven and Jodi Ohlsen Read founded Shepherd’s Way Farms, a sheep dairy about an hour out of Minneapolis. On this family farm, Steven shepherds the flock of 500 East Friesian-cross dairy ewes and Jodi makes every wheel of cheese. Their four sons grew up working on the farm and continue to play various roles in addition to their off-farm jobs. In 2005, a devastating fire destroyed the farm, suspending milking and allowing only a limited amount of cheese production. The Reads were able to rebuild and they resumed full production in 2011. The farm has continued to earn awards for their farmstead cheeses. Shepherd’s Way`s flagship cheese is Friesago, a natural rind sheep milk cheese, and a 2017 American Cheese Society first place winner. They introduced Friesago in 1998 as an accessible sheep milk cheese. Originally, it was a waxed cheese, comparable in style to Spanish Manchego. Over the years, the Reads have changed Friesago: Now, it`s a natural rind cheese. The current iteration keeps the dense texture, subtle flavors, and gentle finish of the original—but has added complexity and a more rustic appearance. When Jodi makes Friesago, she cuts the curds by hand, stirs it out, and presses, before placing the blocks of curd in hoops and stacking them for additional pressing. The wheels are brined and then undergo a drying period, during which they’re washed daily with brine and flipped by hand. Aged for a minimum of 90 days, Friesago is allowed to grow a range of molds including Spordendonema casei, which adds to its earthy, nutty finish. The wheels are brushed before leaving the farm, giving them a stone-like patina.Flavors are mild and milky. Notes of grass give way to a nutty finish.Friesago is a solid addition to a cheese platter, served with fig spread. It`s ideal melted onto pizza or grilled cheese. Try on flatbread with roasted tomatoes and pesto, or on a biscuit over sautéed mushrooms with thyme. Pairs well with bright Italian reds and wheat beers to cut through the rich sheep`s milk."
Fromage Blanc (Bellwether Farms),Bellwether Farms,United States,California,Varies,7oz or 32oz,www.bellwethercheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,None,,,"Family owned and operated by the Callahan family, Bellwether Farms is located in the rolling hills of Sonoma County, about an hour north of San Francisco and a few miles from the Pacific Ocean. Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, in the early 1990`s Cindy Callahan made the decision to change direction, starting a sheep farm. After initially focusing on lamb production, the Callahans were encouraged to develop their sheep into a milking herd. This, combined with a trip to Italy where they had the opportunity to taste many local sheep`s milk cheeses inspired them to start to experiment with cheesemaking. The sheep at Bellwether Farm consist mainly of East Friesian ewes. The ewes give birth to between one and three lambs each year and the lambs stay with their mother for 45 days before the ewe joins the milking line. Each ewe gives, on average, slightly less than one gallon a day and they are milked for eight months before the cycle begins again. The sheep graze freely year round in addition to being given grain and alfalfa as necessary. Cindy`s Callahan son Liam oversees cheese production while his wife Diana manages the office and Cindy focuses on taking care of the sheep. In addition to making a range of sheep`s milk cheeses, the Callahans also buy in local Jersey cow`s milk in order to make a range of cow`s milk cheeses. Renowned for its rich, buttery characteristics, Jersey milk has a higher fat and protein content than most milks, which gives the cheeses a wonderfully rich, balanced flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Bellwether’s version of Fromage Blanc, a European-style cheese, is tangy, buttery and easy to spread. Cultures, vegetable rennet and salt are added to pasteurized cow’s milk then the curd is ladled into cheesecloth and left to hang for 6-8 hours to drain off more whey.Fromage Blanc is a great alternative to cream cheese and fresh chévre. At its best when used as an ingredient in appetizers, main courses and even desserts, it is fabulous as a base for sauces.  It also pairs well with fresh herbs, spices, and specialty breads. "

Friends since college days on the east coast, they moved to California together in the 1970`s, and, since both women were passionately interested in the food business, Peggy went to work at Chez Panisse in Berkeley with Alice Waters, while Sue became co-owner of the famous Bette`s Ocean View Diner. Twenty something yars later in 1993, Sue sold her part of the business in order to form Tomales Bay Foods, a business designed to provide a marketing outlet for local agricultural food products in Marin County. Discovering that her new company was fulfiling a tremendous need and niche, Sue asked Peggy to join her in launching a greatly expanded business, including a permanent farm-market type store selling locally made food products and a cheesemaking operation. The cheesemaking business and retail stores became known as Cowgirl Creamery. The business flourished, and it quickly became clear that the cheese retail, wholesale and cheese making operations were the most successful. Today, Cowgirl Creamery has additional retail stores in San Francisco and Washington DC together with a much larger cheesemaking operation and warehouse based in Petaluma, CA. Cowgirl Creamery, under the guidance of head cheesemaker Maureen Cunnie, produces a range of fresh and mold ripened cheeses using organic cow`s milk from small local dairies. Fromage Blanc is very much a staple in the French diet, but is much less well known in the United States. Used in a similar way to cream cheese, Fromage blanc has a much lighter and fluffier texture.

Fromage Blanc (Cypress Grove Chevre),Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,Northern California,Varies,4 lbs,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,None,,,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. In addition to producing fresh chevre, Cypress Grove also makes Fromage Blanc. Designed with the chef in mind, Fromage Blanc is based on a French recipe and is very similar to fresh chevre, the main difference being that it has a higher moisture content and a fluffier texture. For production, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are added. The mixture is transferred to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt and is ready for consumption.The profile of Fromage Blanc is clean and cream-like with notes of citrus and a pleasantly goaty tang on the finish."

Owned and run by Dee Harley, a native of Britain, this is the only remaining dairy in San Mateo County, a once thriving dairy region. Having originally started with six pet goats, Harley Farms is now home to over 200 American Alpine goats. The milk is transformed into farmstead cheeses daily. In production of this fromage blanc, milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature in order to retain as much of its character as possible. The process begins as it does in production of Harley Farms’ fresh chèvres, but in this case curds are drained for a shorter time. The final product is higher in protein content than the chèvre, thus it’s less suitable for heating.The shorter draining time in production of this cheese means that flavor is tangier and texture is lighter and fluffier than in a classic fresh chèvre. Incredibly creamy and soft, this cheese has a cloud-like consistency that melts in the mouth.Pair it with a Prosecco or with a Riesling."

Having spent time with a small-scale cheesemaker in Brittany during the 1970s, Allison was working as a state dairy lab technician in Vermont when she responded to a request from Bob Reese to produce some fresh chèvre for a state dinner. At the time, Bob was employed as marketing director for the Vermont Department of Agriculture. The chèvre was a hit and after some experimentation, Bob and Allison decided to go into production on a more formal basis, founding Vermont Creamery. Milk for cheese production comes from twenty-one family farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Quebec. Each farm has an average herd size of approximately 150 goats. Vermont Creamery makes a variety of fresh and young style cheeses and cultured dairy products, many of which are based on French recipes. They also make an outstanding cultured butter. Cheeses are made from either goat`s or cow`s milk. Often referred to as the French answer to yogurt or cream cheese, Fromage Blanc is a cheese made from fresh, soft curds that have been slightly drained of whey. Allison Hooper`s inspiration for Fromage Blanc comes from her time working on a dairy farm in Brittany, in Northern France, where the cheese was regularly mixed with a little sugar and enjoyed for desert.It can also be served with honey, mixed with granola, or simply used as a savory dip when blended with herbs."
Fromage de Meaux,Rouzaire,France,Ile de France,"14 ins diameter, 2 ins high",5-6 lbs,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Made in Ile de France, in northern France, the production of Fromage de Meaux is identical to that of Brie de Meaux, with one key difference. Fromage de Meaux is made from pasteurized milk, whereas Brie can only be produced using raw milk.The AOC (name protected) status awarded in 1980 to Brie de Meaux, stated that cheeses must be made from raw milk in order to comply. In order to satisfy the tremendous demand for Brie de Meaux - as well as comply with the United States` import regulations concerning raw milk cheeses - it was decided to produce a pasturized version called Fromage de Meaux.Traditionally, maturation of Fromage de Meaux lasts about eight weeks and must take place within the areas of Ile de France, Centre, Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine or Bourgogne.Production of Fromage de Meaux can be artisanal or industrial. Due to the large surface area of the cheese, liquid evaporates quickly. Therefore, during cheesemaking, the curd is handled very carefully to retain as much moisture as possible, and cheeses are allowed to drain naturally without any pressing.When Fromage de Meaux is consumed, at least half the thickness of the cheese should be ripe.The cheese has a balanced appearance and aroma and the rind should look like white velvet, although when the cheese is very ripe the top and sides will often have red patches.The interior paste is the color of straw, with occasional holes, becoming softer as the cheese ripens under the rind. Aromas are slightly sweet and smoky with a rich, concentrated mushroom or truffle flavor.As with Brie de Meaux, the flavor characteristics of Fromage de Meaux are luxuriously rich, buttery and smooth and fill the palate in a balanced, creamy way."

Frère Fumant,3 Corner Field Farm,,New York,"8 ins diameter, 5-6 ins high",6 lbs,www.dairysheepfarm.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Smoked,,Smoked,"Owned by Karen Weinberg and her husband Paul Borghard, 3 Corner Field Farm is a sheep dairy and cheesemaking operation located in the Battenkill Valley, near Shushan, New York. Both formerly from Manhattan, Karen and Paul bought the farm in 1990, and now run a flock of 120 East Friesian milking sheep on the property. The sheep are rotationally grazed and moved to fresh pasture every 24 hours. Karen and Paul have worked hard to develop and manage the grazing, providing a wide variety of forage such as clovers, fescue, trefoil, wild oregano, timothy and cattails to enhance the animals` diet and improve milk quality. In addition to cheesemaking, Karen and Paul also sell their lambs, wool and soaps at a number of Farmers Markets that they regularly attend. During the season, which runs from April to September, the sheep are milked twice each day. Every morning, Karen combines cooled milk from the previous evening`s milking with the warm, fresh milk from the morning`s milking to make cheese. Karen makes a variety of cheeses, as well as a sheep`s milk yogurt. The cheeses include the camembert-style Shushan Snow, Feta, and two versions of an aged, Basque-style sheep`s milk cheese called Battenkill Brebis, one of which is smoked and called Frére Fumant. Frère Fumant is made from raw milk and modeled after another smoked sheep`s milk cheese - Idiazabal. Milk is heated to 86°F and a mesophilic starter culture and traditional calf rennet are added. After the curds are formed they are placed into cloth-lined cheese molds. (The cloth leaves small indentations in the rind of the cheese, which help the desirable molds to adhere and grow on the cheese, aiding maturation.) After pressing, the young Frère Fumant are brined for 24 hours before being taken to nearby New Skete monastery. There, Brother David cold smokes the cheeses over Hickory wood before returning them to 3 Corner Field for further maturation. ""Frère Fumant"" literally means ""Smoking Brother"" and is named in honor of Brother David. Wheels are aged for a minumum of two months although some are held for up to 12 months prior to release. The texture of Frère Fumant is smooth, firm and slightly moist. The interior paste is pale golden-ivory in color, while the rind is a deep red-orange color - a result of the smoke. Flavors are sweet, herbaceous, rich and smoky - yet the smoke does not eclipse the flavor of the milk. There are savory hints of grass, clover, almonds and hay."
Försterkäse ,Käserei Krümmenswil  ,Switzerland,St Gallen,"6 ins diameter, 2 ins high",2 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Made by Ernst Diriwächter in the canton of St Gallen in Switzerland, Krümmenswiler Försterkäse (usually known simply as Försterkäse) is a washed-rind cow’s milk cheese, encircled with a strip of spruce bark. Ernst previously specialized in the production of Tilsiter. However, in the face of increasing restrictions he decided to create his own cheeses, each of which are influenced by and reflect the flavors and “terroir” of the region. Milk for the production of Försterkäse is sourced from from fifteen small farms, located near the dairy. The herds contain a high percentage of Brown Swiss cows, a breed whose milk is particularly suited to cheesemaking. Once the milk is at Ernst’s dairy, it is thermalised, meaning that its heated to a higher temperature than raw milk, but not so high as to pasteurize. Ernst believes that this process preserves many of the best flavors of the milk that are then translated through to the cheese. During production, the curd is handled very carefully to preserve as much moisture in the cheese as possible. The cheese vat sits on a raised platform allowing the newly formed curds to be moved via gravity to a draining table below. There, they are put into molds where they remain for 24 hours at room temperature to ‘ripen’ before being transferred to a brine bath in the caves below the cheese room. After removal from the brine, each cheese receives its strip of spruce bark, kept in place with an elastic band. The bark is harvested locally during the summer months, deep frozen and then sterilized in hot water prior to use. The water allows the bark to be curved to the shape of the cheese which, in turn, helps the cheeses to maintain their shape during aging as well as imparting a wonderful woody flavor. In addition, the cheeses are placed on spruce shelves in the aging cave. Cheeses are matured for at least six weeks before release. During the maturation period, they are washed regularly (about three times each week) with a brine solution which encourages the development of the bacterium linens mold. This mold is largely what gives the cheeses its pungent aroma and orange, sticky rind as well as aiding the breakdown or softening of the interior. When young, Försterkäse is fairly firm in texture becoming noticeable softer as it ages which is when it begins to take on the complex floral and woodsy flavors imparted by the spruce."

For brothers Egidio and Mario Fiandino, butter and cheese production is a matter of family tradition. Their forefather, Stephano Fiandino, founded what was to become Fattorie Fiandino at the turn of the 18th century when he moved to the Valle Maira in Piedmont from Milan to raise sheep and make cheese. In the 1920’s, the brother’s grandfather, Magno, purchased the estate where the current Fattorie Fiandino is located from the Earls Grimaldi del Poggetto. Due to the respect that Egidio and Mario have toward their family history, the culture of Piedmont and the ecology of the Valle Maira, Fattorie Fiandino only uses traditional techniques in the production of butter and cheese, eschewing much of the technology used in industrial production of dairy products. However, Fattorie Fiandino has also embraced some new technologies; for example, they source about a portion of their power from solar panels installed in 2005. Frumage L`Ottavio is the embodiment of the food culture of the Valle Maira. It is a raw milk cheese that showcases the microclimate of the valley. Milk is coagulated using plant-based rennet (from Cynara cardunculus, a flower in the thistle family). Beer and malt are incorporated into the fresh curd and rubbed onto the outside of the wheels as they age.The resulting cheese has a soft, unctuous texture under its edible brown rind. While its aroma is of beer, the flavor is delicate and mild with notes of coffee and cocoa. Barley malts come at the end as an after-flavor.This cheese pairs very well with dark, malty beers such as stout."
Fumaison,Patrick Beaumont,France,Auvergne,"6 ins high & wide, 14 ins long",4.5 lbs,,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,SmokedNatural,,,"Created by French cheesemaker, Patrick Beaumont in 1990, Fumaison is a smoked raw Lacaune sheep’s milk cheese. It is very similar to Jesus de Lyon, a sausage from Auvergne, in both shape and flavor. The reason is that M. Beaumont uses charcuterie-making techniques to produce Fumaison. For example, it is aged by hanging it from the roof of a cave for 100 days, the same way a ham would be. The production of Fumaison begins two hours after the milk arrives at the cheese-making facility. Rennet is added for quick coagulation and once separated from the whey, the curd is placed in moulds. It is then pressed gently for 24 hours to remove much of the moisture. Next, Fumaison is brined for another full day before beginning the aging process. Once Fumaison is removed from the roof of the caves, it is smoked, creating a cheese like no other. Under a rind that has grey, red and yellow molds is a paste that smells of mushrooms, smoke and wood.Fumaison’s flavor is complex and savory. At the beginning it tastes of smoke and woods. It then develops the flavor of Hazelnuts with a touch of sweet, and a bit of animal in the background. The texture of Fumaison is rich and firm.Fumaison is available from June to September and is best paired with a White Graves, or a sweet Gamay wine. To balance out the smoke, serve it with fresh fruit."
Funkmeister,Haystack Mountain Goat Cheese,United States,Colorado,,8 oz,www.haystackgoatcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Washed,Washed-Rind,," Cow’s milk cheeses are a relatively new venture for this Longmont, Colorado-based dairy, which was founded as a farmstead goat operation in 1989. It was run for nearly two decades by founder and retired teacher Jim Schott, until he ceased his daily creamery work in 2008. Around that time, the dairy began a partnership with the Skyline Correctional Facility in Cañon City, purchasing milk from the facility’s goat farm—a consistent, quality milk source that offers training opportunities for inmates. (For more info, check out culture’s 2012 photo essay on the partnership.) The cow’s milk cheeses, released in mid-2015, are made with organic milk that’s sourced from a local dairy. Funkmeister’s name—which supposedly translates to “foreman of the funk”—says it all. The double-cream cheese, made from organic cow’s milk and cream, is washed repeatedly in brine while it ages, developing an orange-red rind.With a supersoft texture reminiscent of softened butter, or even queso dip, Funkmeister exudes aromas of sausage, bread and stone. On the palate, it’s total salt bomb; itskick brushes away some of the funkier elements in the background, which linger on the palate (oceany notes, mushroom gratin).Slather this cheese on some bread to tamper down saltiness, then wash it down with a floral, piney IPA."
Fuzzy Wheel,Twig Farm,United States,Vermont,"4 ins diameter, 3 ins high",1.25 lbs,www.twigfarm.com,CowGoat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Twig Farm is a small goat dairy and cheesemaking business run by Michael Lee and Emily Sunderman. Located in West Cornwall, Vermont, about ten miles south of Middlebury, the 20 acre farm was established in 2005 and produces aged, raw milk goat cheeses. Having worked as an apprentice at Peaked Mountain Farm in Townsend, Vermont, Michael manages the goats, and produces and ages the cheese. Emily manages the business and marketing for Twig Farm and simultaneously works as an analyst for a publishing company. Twig Farm has a herd of 25 milking does, most of which are Alpine, though there is one Nubian and a few Saanens. They make a variety of raw milk cheeses of which Fuzzy Wheel is one. Fuzzy wheel is a very seasonal cheese, being made only in the early spring months from a mix of Twig Farm’s raw goat’s milk mixed with raw Jersey cow’s milk. The cow’s milk comes from Animal Farm in nearby Shoreham and is left over from their butter-making process. It therefore has a fat content of approximately 2% - ie. partially skimmed. Since the cheese is made in early spring during the colder months, the cheese maturing room is naturally much drier. The cheeses naturally develop a layer of fuzzy mold on their exterior, but the lower humidity greatly slows the rate of growth allowing Michael to spend less time in the aging room and allowing him to focus on other tasks. The cheeses are aged for between 70-90 days before release, at which point they have fully developed the ‘fuzzy’ grey mold on the rind, that gives the cheese its name. The interior paste of the cheese is ivory white in color with a supple texture dotted with small ‘eyes’ or holes. Flavors taste richly of milk, butter and cream with earthy and piquant notes."

This is an area well known for its sheep and cows, as well as the high altitude mountain pastures that provide such favorable summer grazing for the livestock.Raw milk from both sheep and cows is used for the production of Gabietou, in a ratio of about one third to two thirds respectively. Cheeses are made from November to July. The maturing process, which lasts between three anf five months, involves washing the cheeses with a brine solution that comprises of water and rock salt sourced from local warm springs. This, according to Bachelet, contributes to the copper tint seen on the cheese`s rind.Bachelet also sells some young cheeses to affineurs Jean d`Alos and Herve Mons, who mature them in their own cellars before selling them. Each affineur has slightly different maturing methods that will affect the fine tuning of the cheese after production, although the basics remain the same.The texture of Gabietou is semisoft, smooth and supple with a pale, straw-colored paste and occasional holes, or ""eyes."" The rind is thin and a golden-orange color, slightly pungent but not overwhelming.Flavors are dense, rich, mellow and creamy with notes of fruit that are balanced by earthy, mushroomy notes."

Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons.GADDIS was named after cheesemonger Tim Gaddis of Star Provisions in Atlanta, GA, known locally as “Tim the Cheeseman.” The Youngs wanted to pay tribute to his passion for discovering local, handmade cheeses that have a sense of time and place.GADDIS is a seasonal washed-rind cheese made in square blocks. It resembles Taleggio in appearance, but it isn’t really inspired by that Italian cheese. It’s actually made during the production of Fortsonia, another one of Nature’s Harmony Farm’s original cheeses. While making Fortsonia, Tim and Liz interrupt the process at a precise stage and hoop GADDIS cheeses while they continue to make Fortsonia in the vat. They age GADDIS for about 60 days, washing, brushing and flipping the squares daily. In the end, GADDIS is quite different than Fortsonia; while Fortsonia is dense, smooth and nutty, GADDIS is pungent and soft, with a red rind. According to Tim, “this illustrates the affect a cheesemaker can have on helping fluid milk make the leap to blissful bites.”GADDIS is pungent and creamy, with an aroma of freshly cut grass, flavors of sautéed onions and grilled meat, and a lactic, sweet finish. Pair GADDIS with a Riesling, a Gewürztraminer, or an IPA. "
Gamalost,Vik Dairy/Tine,Norway,Sogn og Fjordane and Hardanger,Varies,3.8 lbs & 1 lb ,www.tine.no,Cow,,Firm,Animal,None,,,"Gamalost, which literally translates as “old cheese”, is made from soured skim milk and is aged for about two weeks. It`s brown with lighter coloring towards the center, semi-soft, grainy, and rindless. It contains 1% fat and up to 50% protein.Gamalost has a complex and varied history. Once a staple of the Norweigan diet, it has at various times also been called skiør-ost’ (curd cheese), ‘suurost’ (sour cheese) and ‘ramost’ (pungent cheese). It was traditionally a seasonal cheese, made in the mountains during the summer.Historical accounts suggest that there were two methods of Gamalost production; one in which milk was heated in a cauldron and stirred to break the curds, which then sunk to the bottom after removal from the heat source, and were then molded after whey was removed. In the second, floating curds were scooped out of the cauldron and molded, then put back into boiling whey and left for half an hour. In both cases, cheeses were left in the molds for a few days, then placed on shelves in a warm room. After some softening and mold growth, they were placed in a drier room on birch bark and turned every other day. Sometimes they were placed in wooden chests and/or wrapped in oat straw that had been soaked in gin and juniper berries. Starter cultures used for the recipe varied, and often included Penicillum varieties that imparted a green color to the center of the cheese.Gamalost production gradually decreased, along with seasonal mountain cheesemaking, starting in the mid-19th century. Today, Vik Dairy in Sogn is the only remaining producer of Gamalost, and the cheese is sold under the Tine label. Modern production resembles the second method described in historical accounts; skim milk is heated to 63 degrees celsius, curds are separated from whey, then molded and set into vats of boiling whey for a couple of hours. Once unmolded, they`re placed on steel shelves and sprayed with a mucor mucedo car. racemosus mold culture (a pure strain as opposed to the varied strains of the past). The mold imparts a thick, fuzzy surface to the cheese within 3 days, which is patted down by hand a few times before ripening finishes in 12-14 days.Gamalost is difficult to find outside of Norway, as it`s not made in sufficient quantity for export. Yet it remains a source of local pride in the Sogn region; each summer there`s a Gamalost festival (Gamalostfestivalen) in Vik.Gamalost is often eaten on dark break with sour cream, butter, cranberries, or syrup, or served alongside fresh fruit."
Queso de Gamonéu,Various,Spain,Asturias,"8 ins diameter, 5 ins high",4-6 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,NaturalBlue,,,"Cow, goat, sheep, natural mold, white mold, and blue mold: this Spanish wheel has it all. Produced northern Spain`s Asturias region, Queso de Gamonéu (also known as Gamonedo) was originally produced as a “transhumance” cheese, made seasonally during the annual migration of animals to and from higher mountain pastures, with whatever milk was available (often a blend of cow, sheep, and goat). Today it`s made year round by a dwindling number of artisanal producers, most of whom are no longer nomadic. As they grow older, their knowledge and traditions are in danger of disappearing—but a PDO (protected designation of origin) aims to preserve the recipe and traditional techniques. To make this rustic wheel, the curds are gently pressed to retain as much moisture as possible. After unmolding, they`re lightly salted on the outside. Three days later, they are placed in a small cabaña where they’re lightly smoked and allowed to gently dry for another month. At that point, the wheels are transferred to a maturing cave with walls covered in natural mold for further aging of between one and two months before release. Although Gamonéu can be considered a blue cheese, unlike most blues, it`s not pierced to accelerate the flow of oxygen that promotes blue veining. Rather, the delicate patches of interior blue mold are allowed to develop naturally, giving the cheese a gentle flavor where the blue is in sync with the flavors of the milk and smoke, neither one overwhelming the other.The rind is natural and slightly undulating, with a beige color pockmarked with white mold. The interior is dark ivory with intermittent patches of delicate blue veining. The flavors of this unique cheese begin gently and build steadily, accumulating hints of blue, butter, raw cow’s milk, earth and grass in a full, long finish with aromas of apple and cellar. The texture is firm and slightly dry, with a granular, delicately chalky mouth-feel and naturally permeating blue mold.For a terroir-driven pairing, try Gamoneu alongside a hard cider from Asturias."

Owned and run by Dee Harley, a native of Britain, this is the only remaining dairy in San Mateo County, a once thriving dairy region. Having originally started with six pet goats, Harley Farms is now home to over 200 American Alpine goats. The milk is transformed into farmstead cheeses daily. In production of this fresh chèvre, the milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature in order to retain as much of its character as possible. The curd is also handled very gently to preserve the high moisture and delicate texture of the cheese. The fresh cheese is allowed to drain for 12-16 hours before being formed into logs and rolled in chopped chives.Flavor of Garden Chive Chèvre is fresh, milky and sweet with slight vegetal notes, a hint of citrus and a balanced chive flavor.

Garlic (Everona),Everona Dairy,United States,Virginia,"4” tall, 9” diameter; or 3” tall, 4” diameter",6 – 7 lbs,www.everonadairy.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Washed,,,"It is rare indeed that a dog began a dairy, but that is exactly what happened in the case of Everona Dairy. At a Food Festival in 1992, the late Dr. Patricia (Pat) Elliot came upon a demonstration of the skills of Border Collies and was so impressed, she took a puppy home with her. Soon it became obvious that the dog needed something to keep occupied, and what is the best thing to keep a Border Collie occupied? Sheep. So, sheep were purchased and in time began to drain the good doctor’s bank account. In an effort to have the sheep pay for themselves, Dr. Elliot began milking them with a view to developing a cheesemaking operation.Whereas some people might be daunted by the prospect of taking on an additional new cheesemaking career with no previous knowledge of sheep or making cheese, Dr. Elliot was undeterred. A medical doctor who had raised seven children and adopted two others, while simultaneously putting herself through medical school, she was well equipped with the determination to teach herself how to make cheese. Pat was also a life-long DIYer and, after reading books on the topic, at age 67 took classes at the University of Wisconsin to learn the scientific side of cheese making. By 1996, she had also travelled to Greece for further education. While it took a long time to reach the skill-level necessary to produce great cheese, in 2005 the ACS awarded Everona‘s Piedmont with its top honors in the Farmhouse Sheep’s milk cheese category. Until her death in 2013 at age 85, Dr. Elliot continued to practice medicine as well as helping to run the Dairy with her son, Brian, and daughter-in-law, Carolyn.Using Piedmont as the base cheese for this riff on the original, Garlic is a raw milk cheese produced in limited quantities, and only periodically. It has a light orange rind, the product of washes in a brine solution, covering a pale cream-colored paste with small eyes sprinkled throughout. The number pressed into its side is the batch number that the cheese was produced in. With Piedmont at its core, Garlic has a nutty sweetness that underlies the intense garlic flavor. It has a rich semi-firm to firm texture.With the intense garlic flavor of this cheese, big, bold red wines with firm tannins are best. Try it with Spanish Rioja or Italian reds that use Tempranillo grapes or a good Cabernet Sauvignon. Darker beers such as stouts are highly recommended as well. This is the cheese to cook with if you like garlic. So, whether it is melted over ripe tomatoes and arugula on an open faced sandwich, into a béchamel sauce for garlic Mac n’ Cheese, or mixed with Mozzarella on top of pizza, it adds that extra punch."
Garrotxa,Various,Spain,Catalonia,6 ins diameter x 4 ins height,2 lbs,,Goat,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced in Catalonia, Garrotxa is a traditional Spanish goat`s milk cheese. It had virtually become extinct by the 1980`s, but it was revived in 1981.Today, Garrotxa is produced by a small number of cheesemakers who are dedicated to revitalizing this cheese. Historically, Spain, unlike other European countries, did not develop as many cheeses for commercial sale. However, recent years have seen this trend reversed. New cheesemakers have inspired a renaissance of traditional and formerly-extinct cheeses, like Garrotxa, as well as the introduction of many new varieties. Made from pasteurized goat`s milk, Garrotxa is shaped into 2lb rounds and matured for between three and four weeks in natural caves. The cheese develops a suede-like dark gray rind, inspiring its other moniker: ""Pell Florida,"" which means ""bloomy rind"" in the Catalan dialect. The interior paste is ivory-white in color, with occasional small holes, and becomes slightly darker towards the rind. The texture is firm, smooth, and slightly flaky.Flavors are mildly herbal and earthy, with a pleasant goaty tang that lingers. There is a hint of hazelnuts in the aftertaste.Serve with walnuts, honey, and Spanish ham as a part of a tapas spread. Garrotxa pairs well with simple reds and crisp whites like Vinho Verde and Cava, or try it with a summery wheat beer."

Made from a mix of cow`s and sheep`s milk, it ripens into a luscious little wheel over time. The transformation happens over 15 days at Brooklyn`s Crown Finish Caves, whereaffineurs experiment with maturation methods and as diverse array of washes in a former layering tunnel under the Nassau Brewery building. (The tunnels here stay at about 50 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, the perfect climate for ripening cheese.) Much experimentation here has centered around Gatekeeper, which has been washed in a range of different ciders while aging, yielding several iterations. First, it was washed in Millstone`s Farmgate—hence its name—a dry and earthy cider from Maryland that gave the cheese a unique allium flavor. Now it`s washed in Farm Flor from Graft Cider, apleasantly-sour cider from New York. Fruitier than Farmgate, though still not super juicy, the rustic, barrel-aged libation pushes the cheese in a funkier direction.Fudgy, dense, and creamy, Gatekeeper`s flavors range from fruity to vegetal to funky.While hard cider is the obvious choice, we also love Gatekeeper alongside fresh peaches or a Finger Lakes riesling.

Georgia Gouda,Sweet Grass Dairy,United States,Georgia,"5” tall, 10” diameter",10 - 12 lbs,www.sweetgrassdairy.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Founded by Al and Desiree Wehner in 2000, Sweet Grass Dairy is steeped in dairy farming tradition. Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successibe generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay.For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats.Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition.Made with Jersey Cow milk and aged for at least 60 days, Georgia Gouda has a light brown natural rind and a yellow paste with a few eyes of various sizes dotted throughout.Its aroma reflects the pastures that the dairy’s cow graze in with a nice amount of grass at the beginning, which gives way to a clean lactic smell. Georgia Gouda’s texture is smooth, rich and dense. It has flavors of decadent, sweet, brown butter and roasted nuts with notes of grass.A rich textured cheese deserves a rich beer to drink with it such as an Imperial Stout or a Porter. Georgia Gouda also pairs very well with red wines like Merlot and Zinfandel or white wines such as a Riesling."

The farm is named after the Old Boston Post Stagecoach Road, which runs right through the property. Robert and Gisele Gervais have been farming since 1962 along with their family of fifteenchildren. In 2007 they bought the dairy with their four daughters Anne, Theresa, Susan, and Annette, and they’ve since added a cheesemaking facility and a small retail store to sell the cheeses, goat milk soaps, maple syrups, and bakery items which are all made on the farm. Cheesemaker Anne Doe started making this cheese according to a recipe for Appenzeller, but after doing some research she realized that she wouldn’t be able to recreate the Swiss classic, nor be able to finish it with the top-secret recipe for the brine it’s washed in. So she adapted the recipe and wash to fit her own style, using the farm’s own apple cider and a special mix of spices to make an original brine. The cheese is named after the mother of the family, Gisele. “She does a lot of work behind the scenes but never wants any recognition,” says Doe, “we have 15 siblings in the family… so naming a cheese after her is a very small recognition for all she has done to endure with a family of our size.”This cheese exudes a faintly spicy, floral and cinnamony smell with notes of cooked onions. Texture is creamy, thick and pliable, and flavors build slowly on the palate as a sharpness hits the sides of the tongue. Hints of salami, earth, bark and apples are present towards the rind.Pair it with a sparkling wine, a merlot, pears or grapes."
Gjetost,Tine,Norway,Gudbrand Valley,Various,Various,,GoatCow,,Firm,Vegetable,None,,,"Originally produced in the Gudbrand valley in Norway, Gjetost is also known as Gudbrandsdalsost. The name also derives from the Norwegian word for goat - Gjet. The production of Gjetost is unusual in that it`s made by heating (and therefore reducing) the leftover whey of cow`s and goat`s milk until the lactose caramelizes - hence the light brown appearance of the cheese. The mixture is then poured into rectangular molds (or traditional larger round ones) and left to cool. Occasionally, cheeses are made solely from goat`s milk, in which case they are known as Ekte or genuine Gjetost. Since Gjetost has a very low moisture content, it is extremely durable, so much so that traditionally mariners took the cheese with them on long voyages.Flavors of Gjetost resemble a slightly sour but sweet caramel. The texture is smooth and fudge-like.Contemporary uses include thin-shaven slices accompanied by coffee for breakfast, or as a Christmas time favorite in Norway, where it is eaten with spiced fruit cake."

Adams. That geologically wondrous landscape is where John and Marci Schuman landed after ditching city life in Portland, Oregon. The region itself had once been home to a thriving dairy landscape—known for its caves that mirrored the Roquefort caves of France—and, as they settled into the community, the couple decided to bring back the bygone tradition. After apprenticing under a local dairy farmer, they invested in a production facility on their own property and began sourcing local milk from Pearson dairy to produce a line of cheeses. More recently, the couple invested in an aging facility built right into the lava tube caves—the natural airflow from the subterranean network keeps humidity and temperature at a prime for aging cheeses. One of the company’s flagship cheeses, this blue wheel develops a natural rind as it ages for 75 days, developing a fudgy, deep yellow paste with a beautiful sheen and periwinkle splotching. It’s designed to be a “gateway” blue, approachable and palate-pleasing even to blue cheese skeptics.Aromas are floury and yeasty, reminiscent of damp basement, sweet scones, and spruce trees.

Tipperary, Ireland, is home to the Maher family, fourth generation dairy farmers and their herd of pedigree Friesian cows. There is a long history of quality milk production here, with their first award for milk having been presented in 1905. Breda and Jim Maher together with their son Pat started their cheesemaking operation in 1986. The rich, peaty Tipperary pasture is among the best in the world and ideal for producing artisanal cheeses. As with so many other dairying families in Ireland, part of the spur for getting into cheese production was the introduction of European milk quotas in 1984. The quotas effectively meant that the Mahers were forced to find a way of adding value to their milk. Breda, who already had a degree in hotel management, took a course in cheesemaking at the University of Cork and also gained experience at Ryefield Farm in Cavan. The first stage of the Maher’s cheesemaking plant was completed in 1989. In 1999, the family also purchased the Dublin-based Dúnbarra cheese company, effectively adding several more sales channels. In 2000, Cooleeney also added goat’s milk cheeses to their production range. Gleann Óir was first created in 2009 and is Ireland’s only firm, natural-rinded goat’s milk cheese. Inspiration for this more aged cheese came from the sweet, rich flavors of the goat’s milk and the success of the Maher’s other highly popular soft goat cheese, Gortnamona. The name Gleann Óir comes from the Irish words for “Golden Vale” - a term used to refer to Ireland’s prime dairyland, of which Tipperary is a part. Milk is sourced from a neighbor’s goat herd where the animals roam and graze freely. The pasture here is verdant and lush as a result of the rich, peaty soil.Aged for up to nine months, Gleann Óir delivers a range of flavors that change throughout its maturation.  The sweetness of the milk remains a feature of the cheese accompanying other robust, earthy flavors with notes of cellar and mushrooms. When mature, the natural rind is a mottled brown, grey dotted with spots of yellow mold.  The interior texture is crumbly and dense, becoming darker near the rind as the cheese ages.Pairs well with Viognier"

They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into the property in Maine that had belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Kennebec Cheesery’s classic and most popular chèvre comes in two ways: in small rounds or in cubes marinated in olive oil. To produce the fresh cheese, milk is heat-treated and cooled down to 75-80 degrees before culture and rennet are added. The inoculated milk then sits for 24 hours as the curd forms. The following day, curd is scooped into molds, where it sits for another two days, being flipped periodically, then is salted and moved to the refrigerator. Finally, on the fifth day, rounds are cut into cubes and placed in their containers with a marinade made of herbs and extra-virgin olive oil that’s imported from Italy. Kennebec Cheesery Chèvre is smooth, creamy and lightly salted, with a fantastic spreadable texture. In this cubed version the generous helping of olive oil becomes part of the textural and olfactory experience, with flavors offering only a touch of spice. Marinated cubes are sold in the following flavor combinations: Basil, Pine Nut and Garlic; Herbes de Provence; Rosemary, Garlic and Peppercorn; Sundried Tomato and Chili Pepper."

Goat Montasio,Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,,5 lbs,www.mozzco.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Hard,Vegetable,,Alpine-style,,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as this Montasio, inspired by the aged Italian classic of the same name. The traditional PDO-protected Italian version of Montasio cheese is produced in a mountainous region near Venice. Like the original, this Texan version becomes nuttier in flavor and firmer in texture as it ages for six months. But Paula and her team have spiced up the traditional recipe with added twists such as, in this case, the use of goat’s milk sourced from different grade “A” farms in Texas and Oklahoma.With a dry, crumbly texture reminiscent of an aged Asiago, this Goat Montasio is thick and chunky in texture, lending itself easily to grating. Flavor is subtle and almost sweet, earthy and lightly floral. An initial sharpness subsides as sweet flavors build progressively, and notes of whiskey are present.Pair it with a Pinot Noir."
Goatlet,Consider Bardwell / Crown Finish Caves,United States,Vermont / New York,10 in diameter x 3 in height,10 lbs,considerbardwellfarm.com,CowGoat,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,," Purchased by Angela Miller and Russell Glove in 2000 and licensed as a creamery in 2004, Consider Bardwell Farm makes award-winning cheeses out of West Pawlet, Vermont. Currently, the farm uses goat’s milk from their own herd of Oberhaslis and cow’s milk from neighboring dairy farms to make their small batch cheeses.  “Goatlet was a cheese created out of necessity,” says Leslie Goff of Consider Bardwell. To use up the season’s last goat milk, cheesemakers blended it with cow milk (20% goat’s milk to 80% cow’s milk). Goatlet, based on the farm’s Italian-style toma Pawlet, became a way for them to celebrate Thanksgiving: Blending the milks shortened the make day so staff could return to their families earlier.   For years, Goatlet remained a staff favorite, with limited quantities sold in New York City farmers’ markets. But in 2017, Goff suggested partnering with Crown Finish Caves, the small affinage company that operates out of Brooklyn’s now defunct Nassau Brewery. The underground tunnels—once used as a space for lagering beer—now house cheese, moving about 70,000 pounds over a year. Crown Finish does not make the cheese; instead, different makers, like Consider Bardwell, provide young cheeses for them to age.  Goatlet is aged for an average of five months in Crown Finish’s cool and humid caves. It’s washed in a light brine for a week, and then brushed and flipped weekly. Goatlet’s textured gray rind is imprinted with a cheerful goat face.Goatlet has a firm paste. On the palate, expect a yogurt-like tang and notes of lemon cream pie. Try Goatlet on a slab of rustic bread with a layer of whole grain brown mustard and pickles. Pair with a farmhouse ale (Benton Brown, co-owner of Crown Finish, recommends the one from New York City’s urban brewhouse Transmitter Brewery)."

Gorgonzola Dolce PDO,Various,Italy,Piedmont or Lombardy,"25-30cm diameter, 25cm high",25 lbs,,Cow,PasteurisedRaw,Soft,Animal,Foil Wrap,Blue,,"Those seeking a blue cheese with a kick might turn to a Gorgonzola Piccante, but not everyone is always in the mood for that Italian mountain cheese`s hit of pungency. That`s why this version was developed; meaning ""sweet"" in Italian, Gorgonzola ""Dolce"" was developed largely in response to the demand for a milder version of the iconic blue wheel. The production process for Dolce is almost identical to that of Piccante, and both styles must be made according to name protection regulations (DOP in Italy; PDO at the EU level). Cow`s milk is sourced from one of the designated provinces in Piedmont or Lombardy, and the cheese must also be made within that area. About 60 dairies, ranging from small family operations to giant industrial concerns, produce Gorgonzola. The main difference between Dolce and Piccante is the age. The former matures for about two months, whereas the later is aged for at least three months and often longer. For both styles, milk is inoculated with blue mold spores to induce veining, but the Dolce requires a less intense culture. The curd for Gorgonzola Dolce is neither cooked nor pressed. This results in a higher-moisture cheese with a lighter, more open texture that allows for ample development of blue mold. The vein development gets a boost when the wheels are three to four weeks old, at which time they`re pierced with steel needles to introduce air. The interaction of oxygen with the enzymes, and mold with oxygen, allows the blueing to develop much more rapidly. Weighing about 25 pounds, wheels of Gorgonzola Dolce are usually cut into quarters before shipment, with each piece wrapped in foil to protect the rind and prevent further moisture loss.The interior paste of Gorgonzola Dolce is ivory-white in color with subtle blue-green veins that are widely spaced. Flavors are milky and unctuous, with notes of sour cream and butter and a clean, lactic tang.Gorgonzola Dolce pairs well with a Tuscan Vin Santo or a Champagne. Our favorite way to eat it, though? Scooped into a mini ice cream cone."
Gorgonzola Piccante (Mountain),Various,Italy,Lombardy or Piedmonte,"12 ins diameter, 8 ins high",25 lbs, ,Cow,,BlueFirm,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced in both the Piedmonte and Lombardy regions of Italy, Gorgonzola Naturale is a cow`s milk blue cheese with a big history.The town of Gorgonzola was a traditional resting point in the spring and autumn for the herds of cows making their way back and forth between the alpine pastures of Lombardy.Local farmers took advantage of the surfeit of milk that arrived in the town and used it to make cheese. They also discovered a natural strain of Penicillum Glaucum mold in the area, that, if allowed to develop, caused the cheeses to taste much better than before. Subsequently, they actively encouraged its growth and Gorgonzola was created. Today there are about 40 producers of Gorgonzola Naturale, and Italian law dictates that Gorgonzola can only be made in either Lombardy or Piedmonte.Gorgonzola is produced in two styles: Dolce and Piccante. Dolce is the younger version that was developed just after WWII. Piccante or Mountain Gorgonzola is the more traditional, matured version. (Gorgonzola Piccante was formerly known as Gorgonzola Naturale or Stagionato.)Today, the cheese may be made from either pasteurized or raw milk. Traditional artisanal producers use the two day curd method, whereby the inoculation of the milk happens as a result of adding the previous day`s curd to the mix. However, the majority now make the cheese in one day and innoculate with a starter culture.After about a month, wheels are pierced with copper needles that allow the air to penetrate the cheese and the blue veins to develop.The cheeses are wrapped in foil to preserve moisture and the maturation continues for a total of three to six months, during which time cheeses develop a reddish rind.The texture of Gorgonzola Naturale is dense, smooth and punctuated with pockets of slightly crunchy crystals contained within the blue veins - especially on more mature cheeses.The color of the paste is a dark ivory, shot through with fine blue/green/grayveinsFlavors can be assertive, robust, meaty and spicy. An indicator of the strength of the cheese is the paste of the interior - the darker it is, the stronger it will taste."
Gouda - Smoked (Maple Leaf Cheese Cooperative),Maple Leaf Cheese Cooperative,United States,Wisconsin,"10 ins diameter, 5 ins high",12 lb,www.mapleleafcheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Smoked,,,"Located in Monroe, WI, Maple Leaf Cheese was founded as a co-operative in 1910 by a group of local family farmers wishing to establish a consistent, trustworthy market for their milk. Today, three generations later, Maple leaf is still farmer-owned, by many of the same families that helped establish it one hundred years ago. Cheesemaking takes place under the guidance of Jeff Wideman and Paul Reigle, both Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers. A variety of cheeses are produced at Maple Leaf including their renowned Smoked Gouda. According to Jeff Wideman, the inspiration for this cheese dates back to 1982 when he was searching for additional styles of cheese to add to his range, thereby helping to benefit the co-operative members and milk suppliers. Mapleleaf has collaborated with the same smoke house in nearby Evansville since 1982. The cheeses, which are smoked over hickory chips, are sent for smoking at about one week of age. The process is a delicate one with the length of the smoke depending on the time of year and outside temperature. In terms of flavor profile, Jeff is looking for a balance of smokiness that works well with the cultures and the milk , each element being able to work well independently as well as together. Maple Leaf Smoked Gouda has a gentle, yet distinctive smoke aroma. The texture is firm. Flavors are pleasantly light, with a sweet maple flavor enhanced with a more meaty umami bacon flavor."

Gouda Gris,Imported by Essex St Cheese,Netherlands,,"10 ins diameter, 3 ins high",9 lbs,,Goat,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Gouda Gris is a farmhouse gouda made at a small co-operative dairy in northern Holland. Milk is sourced from a single herd of Saanen goats only during the spring and summer months when the goats are pastured and there is no silage in their diet.After the wheels are formed, cheeses are allowed to soak in a brine solution for twenty four hours. This hardens the outer surface and promotes the development of the rind. They are then packed up and transported to the Cher region of France to mature in natural caves at a temperature of between 51-54 degrees F. During this time, wheels are turned and occasionally brushed to control the development of mold.After a maturation period of two years, the cheeses are released. At this point the interior paste is white and occasionally tinged with a hint of pink while the exterior rind is a gentle grey color - hence the name. Flavors are earthy and nutty, with caramel notes and a sweet aroma.Good pairings include dark beers such as stouts or white Loire wines."

Gouda (Old Amsterdam),Westland,Netherlands,Various,"14.5 inches diameter, 4.5 inches high",22 lbs,www.oldamsterdam.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Plasticoat,,,"One of the Netherlands’ most famous Goudas, Old Amsterdam was first created in the 1940’s by Lambert Westland and his family. Lambert’s father, Gijsbert Westland, had originally been a thriving fish merchant, but the construction of the IJsselmeer Dam in 1932 signaled the end of fishing for the family. Having always been enthusiastic about cheese, they soon set sights on becoming skilled cheese mongers, buying a cheese wholesale and maturing business in Amsterdam. A few years later, the Westlands expanded their business by developing their own Gouda recipe, cultures and maturing process. The business model proved successful and, over the intervening decades, the company has grown considerably. Today, Old Amsterdam is made at a several Dutch dairies that work with carefully selected, high quality milk, according to the original family recipe. Cow’s milk for each cheesemaking operation is sourced from a number of farms that typically have about 50 Friesian Holstein cows, each cow producing between 30-40 liters (8-10 US gallons) per day. For production, the incoming milk is pasteurised and then the starter culture, rennet and a small amount of annatto (natural coloring) are added. After the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut and transferred into the distinctive Gouda-shaped molds. The cheeses are pressed and then placed in a brine tank which helps to develop the rind. After several hours in the brine, the wheels are transferred to a maturing warehouse. The process of maturation for Old Amsterdam is fairly unique in that it consists of three different stages. Each stage, is designed to contribute and bring out certain characteristics in the flavor and texture development of the cheeses. The wheels mature at different rates, so the decision as to when they are ready for release is based on flavor and texture rather than time, the judgment call being made by the company’s specialist master cheesemakers. The interior paste of Old Amsterdam is pale butterscotch in color. The paste is smooth but dotted with occasional eyes and small crystalline nuggets of amino acids.

The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese.

Through the ages, the garrison changed hands several times, passing to the Medici family and was even occupied by the German army in 1943 until Allied soldiers captured the manor and made it their headquarters. Over the centuries, Palagiaccio has endured and retained its function as a fortified farm. In recent years, it`s been restored as a testament to the culture and tradition of Tuscany.  The milk is sourced from cows that drink mineral water from the Panna mountain. Once the cheese is made, it is aged in the Ubaldini Grottos beneath the Palagiaccio for 15 months and massaged each day with local extra virgin olive oil.Gran Mugello is intensely buttery with hints of nuttiness and olive oil. Each bite can be savored slowly as it melts in the mouth.Pair Gran Mugello with a Champagne or bubbly Italian. If you prefer reds, try a Tuscan chianti classico or Montalcino."

Grana Padano,Various,Italy,Po River Valley,18 in diameter x 9 ins height,80 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,Grana / Grating cheese,,"Grana Padano is a hard cheese produced from raw, semi-skimmed cow`s milk and often aged for up to two years. In fact, the word “grana” means “grainy”, in reference to the cheese’s granular texture. A single Wheel weighs a hefty 80 pounds, and the thick rind is a dark straw color that can become slightly oily when warm. The interior paste of the cheese is a pale butterscotch, closely textured and dense with no ""eyes,"" or holes. Grana Padano also features crystalline spots of an amino acid called tyrosine, which give the paste an extra crunch.  A close cousin to Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano originated in the 12th century, created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle Abbey. The popularity of the cheese grew rapidly, and by 1200 Grana Padano was being produced by a large number of cheesemakers. Today, the areas of production are Piedmont, Lombardy and Veneto, and in the provinces of Trento, Bologna, Ferrara, Forlì, Piacenza and Ravenna.  In 1996 it gained a protected designation of origin status (or PDO). The designation is placed on foodstuff from a specific region, whose quality is determined by the environment surrounding the particular are, and whose production takes place within that designated region. In the case of Grana Padano, it is prepared, processed, and produced all within the Po River Valley.Grana Padano has a fragrant aroma. On the palate, expect notres of caramel, butterscotch, and tropical fruit flavor.Grana Padana goes beautifully with Italian wines such as Barolo and Gavi. Younger versions pair well with pilsner, while more aged versions pair well with darker, maltier beers. Use as a grating cheese or serve on a cheese board with prosciutto."

In order to cave-age his cheese, Mr. Guffanti purchased an abandoned silver mine in the Varese province of Italy. When his sons, Carlo and Mario took over the business in the early 20th century, they began exporting their cheese to Argentina, California and other regions where large numbers of Lombards and Peidmontese had emigrated. Today, while Guffanti is still famous for its Gorgonzola, it also produces and ages a wide range of cheeses from throughout Italy for sale both domestically and abroad. Gratin, also called Toma Brusca is a cooked and pressed cow’s milk cheese from Piedmont. The small, but hefty cheese has a surprisingly intense sweet flavor. This is as a result of the milk being allowed to curdle naturally, without the used of rennet during the first step in the production process.The dense ivory colored paste is enveloped by a dark rind, which is spattered with yellow, grey and white molds. When young, the paste is so dense and firm that it is friable, but with age, the paste breaks down, becoming supple and more yielding. It is suggested that Gratin should be paired with full-bodied red wines and beer. This is a cheese that can, and should be enjoyed on its own."

Made with cow`s milk, Grayson is soft, yielding, and reddish-orange, yielding a pungent aroma and an approachable flavor.  Rick and Helen Feete launched Meadow Creek Dairy in 1988 as a family farm in the mountains of southwest Virginia. The Feetes use sustainable livestock management practices, including rotational grazing, to allow the soil and the pasture to replenish without being overburdened. Over the years, they`ve focused on improving the genetics and milk quality of their herd of Jersey cows, breeding for specific characteristics and shaping the unique terroir of the cheese.  Meadow Creek produces cheese seasonally, beginning in late March after the calves have been born and the grass shows signs of new growth. The herd grazes on native grasses and legumes, with the occasional supplementation of grains, salt, and Norwegian kelp. Milking and cheese production slow down in the fall and come to a halt just before Christmas. Unlike many dairy operations, Meadow Creek’s cows are never confined.   The development of Grayson was inspired by the Feetes` trip to Wales and Ireland in 2000. After many years of tweaking the recipe and process, and a few more trips to Europe (for research purposes, of course), the Feetes settled on the version of Grayson that`s made today. The final product is a direct reflection of its locality and a perfect expression of the nuanced flavors of the milk that go into it. Grayson’s flavors are robust and balanced, with savory notes of bacon, smoke, grass, and butter. It can be slightly sweet, with nutty and earthy undertones.Grayson is the type of cheese that can stand alone in its boldness. However, it does pair well with bread and dried fruit, a full-bodied chardonnay, or a medium red like pinot noir. "

Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successive generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with his future wife, Desiree, persuaded him to stay. For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing their number of cows, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats. Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the family farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the business. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheesemaking operations and has now gained national recognition. Green Hill is a double cream cow’s milk cheese made in the style of Camembert. The cheese is created over a five-hour process that includes hand ladling the curds into molds. Disks undergo a short aging period of two weeks before being wrapped by hand and released for sale.The resulting cheese has a golden-yellow paste, aromas of sautéed mushrooms and cream on the nose, and a rich, silky texture that coats the mouth. Flavors of sweet butter and popcorn linger, with hints of cellar and funk.This cheese is best paired with a sparking wine, that will cut through the richness of the paste. It can also be paired successfully with Belgian Trippel ale. Serve Green Hill with sweet preserves, dried figs, local honey, mild salamis, or a bright tasting piece of fruit like watermelon."

When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. Thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, today they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well suited to cheesemaking; in terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, which comprise of 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of several other Vermont based producers. This cheese was created when the Cellars teamed up with Murray’s Cheese in New York City to create an original for Eleven Madison Park’s “Iconic New York” menu. The name “Greensward” was inspired by the first name for Central Park, “the Greensward Plan.” The spruce-wrapped cheese, which is created in the style of the famous Alpine Vacherin Mont d’Or, was developed after much experimentation: adjustments in the micro climate, adding yeast to the Virtue Cider-based brine that the rounds are bathed in, and transferring the cheese to different caves.With an orange-hued, textured rind enclosed by a spruce jacket, this cheese is visually striking. Its off-white paste is spoonably creamy and silky, while taste is pungent and perfumed with floral, resiny notes. Hints of ripe fruit, wet barnwood, kalamata olives and leaves can be detected, and rounded, savory flavors of broth, meat and booze linger on the palate.Pair Greensward with a Bourbon or with a Pinot Noir."

However, there are some versions of Gres des Vosges that are washed with Kirsch - a type of cherry brandy. In either version, as with most washed rind cheeses, the flavor of the cheese is much milder than the smell would suggest.The interior paste is white, smooth, rich and velvety, becoming yielding and unctuous with age.Flavors are very clean and lactic, with notes of fruit and straw.Either version can be considered a cousin to Muenster cheese - one with a slightly less intense flavor."
Grevenbroecker,Catharinadal Farm,Belgium,Flanders,"3” tall, 11 ¾” diameter",12 lbs,www.catharinadal.be,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Blue,,,"Located in the former site of a Franciscan convent in the Flanders region of northern Belgium, brothers Peter and Bert Boonen along with their wives Cane and Carine run the family farm, Catharinadal.The brothers took the farm over from their father in 1990. At that time the milk from the family’s 60 cows was used to produce butter, but Peter and Bert expanded production to include a cheesemaking operation. Today, the herd has grown to 100 cows that graze on clover-rich fields on the family’s 50 acres. Bert and Carine care for the cows while Peter and Cane are responsible for the cheesemaking, including a number of historic regional cheeses that date back 500 years. All the cow’s milk used for production is raw and sourced from the family’s herd. The goat’s milk used in some of the cheeses comes from the farm De Stalse Schans, located in Koersel, Belgium.A strikingly beautiful cheese, Grevenbroecker is made from raw cow’s milk. The process that creates the blue veining surrounding the large cream-colored curds starts with hand stacking the Penicillium Roqueforti inoculated curds in the molds. As air seeps through the cracks in the cheese, over a period of ten weeks, the blue mold is activated and spreads throughout; following the natural fissures between the curds.As a result, Grevenbroecker is a cheese with a robust oblue flavor, but without being aggressive or overly assertive.  Instead, it balances sweet grass and earthy flavors. The texture is almost fudge-like, but when served at room temperature, it’s spreadable. The manual process used to make Grevenbroecker is so intense that the production is extremely limited, from 30 to 35 wheels per week.  However, the cheese has been extremely well received both in Europe and in the USA, winning at the 2008 Caseus Awards in Lyon, France.The classic pairing of Tawny Port with blue holds true with Grevenbroecker.  As far as beer pairings, Trappist style ales are best, with Achel Trappist dark and Brooklyn Local 2 as particular favorites."

Master Cheesemaker Jean-Marie Dunand runs the village dairy at 2,950 feet above sea level in the heartland of traditional Gruyère production in the Fribourg region of Switzerland. The dairy, which dates back to 1900, has been run by Dunand since 1986. He makes 18-20 wheels of Gruyère each day, 365 days a year, using freshly delivered milk from eight small local farms. The cows graze on mountain pasture, and the unique composition of the grass is reflected in the cheese. After wheels have been aged for three months at Le Crêt, Fromage Gruyère SA brings them to their caves 15 km away to continue the affinage. Fromage Gruyère was founded in 1916 as a public affineur to sustain the production of Gruyère in its traditional production zone. Today the company, led by Gérald Roux, is the only affineur still located the ""La Gruyère"" region. They’re responsible for aging Gruyères from 30 small village dairies and 18 Alpages (high mountain dairies). To distinguish the highest-quality cheeses, Roux and his team have launched the ‘1655’ brand of Gruyère AOP. To qualify for the 1655 brand, a dairy’s cheeses are rigorously tested monthly by team of external experts (one representative of the AOP organization, one representative of the Gruyère master cheesemaker association, and one representative of the Gruyère affineurs association) at four months of age. They’re graded according to condition, taste, texture, consistency, form and condition on a scale up to 20 points. Gruyère AOP Le Crêt has a five-year average of 19.67 points and is one of only three dairies to meet the 1655 criteria. Gruyère AOP 1655 producers exclusively use Sel des Alpes in production–a pure salt from a 200 million year old source that`s been continually rinsed out with water from the Les Diablerets glacier. Gruyère AOP 1655 from Le Crêt is aged at least 12 months. Its paste is the color of butterscotch, and its texture is firm, dense and slightly flaky.Flavor is a complex balance of sweetness and salt, under which one can detect a nutty, caramel taste with notes of mushrooms, hay, earth and fruit."

There are strict rules surrounding the animals` diet because of the effect it has on the milk, and therefore cheese production.Milk is usually delivered twice daily from farms within a 12 mile radius. Although evening milk is held overnight and milk from the second milking is sometimes skimmed, all milk must be less than 18 hours old at the start of cheesemaking.Cheeses are made using cultured, raw cow`s milk and production typically occurs in an open copper vat.Rennet is added at 87°F and coagulation lasts between 30 and 50 minutes. After cutting, the curds are re-heated to about 131°F for 40-45 minutes before being put into molds, where they are pressed with 600-1900lbs. of pressure for about 20 hours.After pressing, cheeses are brined and placed on spruce shelves in the maturing cellar at a temperature of about 55°F with a relative humidity of about 92%. For the first 8-12 days the cheeses are salted, rubbed and turned daily. Cheeses are then matured for a minimum of five months.Ideally, maturation should last 12-16 months, during which time the cheeses are washed regularly with a brine solution and have the opportunity to reach their full potential.With an interior paste the color of butterscotch, the texture of a well matured Gruyère is firm and dense and slightly flaky, frequently studded with small, crunchy granules that are crystalized amino acids.Flavors are a complex balance of sweetness and salt that should dissipate, revealing a nutty, caramel taste with notes of mushrooms, hay and earth and fruit."

After marrying into a farming family in Ireland, ­where some of the best milk in Europe is produced, ­ Giana, with and her husband Tom started to experiment with their own cheeses and ultimately began to produce Gubbeen on a regular basis. The West Cork Gulf Stream creates a warm and humid climate at Gubbeen, which is ideal for growing grass and making cheese. Giana`s and Tom`s farming methods strive to keep the land productive for grazing, and their herd of cows are kept outside on pasture for at least eight months of the year. Milk is sourced from their own mixed breed herd, which consists of British Friesian, Simmental, Jersey and Shorthorn breeds, together with Ireland`s only native breed, the Kerry Cow. Milk from a mixed herd, can prove a great asset to cheesemaking because of the balance of butterfat and proteins. Giana and the Gubbeen dairy team have produced Gubbeen since 1979. After production, wheels of Gubbeen are regularly washed with a solution of the natural Gubbeen flora which has been isolated and made up as a rind wash, together with white wine, salt and water. The wash stimulates the growth of the Bacterium Linens mold (the culture that gives the cheeses their sticky orange-pink rind and pungent aroma) and creates the unique Gubbeen rind . With age, Gubbeen also often develops patches of white candidum mold on the rind as well. The interior paste is semi-soft, pliable and a golden, straw-like color, with small ""eyes"" (holes). It has pleasant aromas that are slightly musty, earthy and reminiscent of an old cellar. Flavors are of mushrooms, butter, peat and nuts - all pleasantly in sync with one another and not as strong as the aroma would suggest."

Cheeses are selected for smoking at 5 days old. Wheels are first brined and then dried to promote a dry surface before going into the smoker for four days. The smoking process takes place over locally gathered beech and oak wood that is stored for a season before use. Giana uses the Pinney method of smoking, which means that any tar given off by the smoke is diverted away from the cheeses allowing for a very gentle process and delicate flavor. Cheeses are closely monitored during smoking and adjustments made for heavy or wet weather which slows everything down. When the wheels emerge, they are virtually the same color as when they went in. Each cheese is checked to ensure no ash has fallen onto the rind. After drying for a day in the creamery, the newly smoked wheels have three thin coats of wax applied to each side, before being transferred to a humidity controlled maturing room. There, they are held at a temperature of between 41-46 F (5-8 C) for a period of about 5 months, at which point they are given one last coating of wax before release. The interior paste of Smoked Gubbeen is semi-soft, pliable and a golden, straw-like color, dotted with small ""eyes"" or holes. As far as flavors, Giana is looking for ""Cheese with smoke, not smoke with cheese"". To that end, flavors are delicate and lasting, with light notes of smoke, butter, mushrooms, bog and a fudgy sweetness on the finish."
Hafod,Holden Farm Dairy,United Kingdom,Wales,"10” tall, 10” diameter",22 ½ lbs,www.hafodcheese.co.uk,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Cloth Wrapped,Cheddar-like,,"Holden Farm Dairy is located in West Wales near the Ceredigion coast at Bwlchwernen Fawr. The cheesemaking business is owned and operated by Patrick Holden along with his wife Becky, Patrick’s son Sam and his wife Rachel. Having started out as an organic commune in 1973, Bwlchwernen is the oldest, continuously registered organic farm in Wales. Holden was a member of the commune, and after it was dissolved, he stayed on as a tenant on the land, eventually purchasing the property. Patrick remained committed to the organic movement in the UK, eventually becoming the Director of the Soil Association. Today he runs a charity called the Sustainable Food Trust. In 2005, Holden convinced Sam and Rachel to try making cheese on the farm. Simon Jones, the well-respected cheesemaker at Lincolnshire Poacher, taught the Holden family how to make cheese using Swiss techniques he learned from another famous local cheesemaker, the late Dougal Campbell. Inspired by Dougal’s techniques, Bwlchwernen was producing their own cheese in 2007. Although Hafod is a cheese with traditional Welsh roots, prior to the Holden family taking over, the recipe had undergone various changes, introducing some Swiss influences. However, the Holdens decided to take Hafod back to its Welsh roots and changed the recipe to reflect how cheddars were produced in their community fifty years ago. This change brings new meaning to its name, since Hafod, in Welsh means “a summer place, or pasture,” a perfect reflection of the place next to the river Aeron where Bwlchwernen is located. Hafod is made daily in small quantities of milk sourced from the farm’s herd of Ayrshire cows. The milk is pumped directly from the milking parlor to the wood-sided Dutch vat in the creamery which is where the milk is warmed and a small amount of starter added, beginning a slow ripening and coagulation process. This process also allows the Holdens to use lower temperatures in their cheese making, resulting in a finished cheese with a springy texture and brown butter flavor. Like many traditional cheddars, young cheeses are wrapped in cloth and covered with a thin layer of lard to protect them during aging.Robust, rich and flavorful with notes of grass, Havod owes its butteriness to Ayrshire milk, which is high in fat and protein. Texture is firm and deeply golden in hue.Hafod pairs well with a wide range of beers; Kernel Brewery`s Pale Ale is a particular favorite of the producers. It also pairs nicely with oaked sauvignon blanc and light fruit forward red wines such as pinot noir or beaujolais. It is a great table cheese when paired with fresh apples or pears, and dates. In cooking, it can be grated over pastas as a refreshing twist, and it is excellent in fondue."
Halleck Creek,Nicasio Valley Cheese Company,United States,California,"2 ¼” tall, 8” diameter",4 lbs,www.nicasiocheese.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Located in Nicasio, California, Nicasio Valley Cheese Company is owned and operated by the Lafranchi family. Founded by Fredolino Lafranchi in 1919, Lafranchi Ranch, was a dream come true for the Swiss immigrant who arrived in the U.S. at the age of 17. The ranch became a family operation years later when Will Lafranchi, Fredolino’s eldest son took over running the business. Throughout this period, family connections to Switzerland remained strong and Will, along with his family, visited many times. These visits were filled with locally produced food, including artisanal cheeses at every meal. Inspired by his experiences in the old country, Will dreamed of producing great cheese on his ranch. Unfortunately, Will was unable to achieve this dream during his lifetime, but his children who now run the ranch, founded Nicasio Valley Cheese Company. Nicasio Valley Cheese focuses on bringing cheeses inspired by their family heritage to the U.S. Using rotational grazing for their herd of 400 cows and sustainable practices throughout the ranch, 100% of their herd is certified organically raised and their milk is used for the production of cheese. The creamery is located in a converted milking barn and recycled shipping containers are used as the aging rooms. Halleck Creek is a large-format, bloomy rinded cheese made in the style of Camembert. Considered the big brother of Nicasio Valley’s Formagella, it has a dry, snow-white rind and a mineral aroma.Inside the 3 to 4-week old cheese is an ivory to pale yellow paste that develops a decadently oozy texture and a grassy aroma. The flavor is mild with a touch of tang.With its mild flavors, Halleck Creek is best paired with a White Bordeaux or dry Sparkling Wine. Serving suggestions include pairing it with fruit, in salads, or on sandwiches."
Halloumi,Various,Cyprus,,,,,SheepGoat,,Firm,Animal,Rindless,,,"Halloumi is a bit modest-looking, with a spongy, rubbery-white appearance that belies little of its grandiose Cypriot origins. Yet the Mediterranean island is famous for its diverse flora; simultaneously straddling vegetation zones of Europe, Africa, and Asia, it boasts some 1,800 flowering plants. And the island`s ruminants dine daily on that floral salad, resulting in milk that`s packed with flavor. Traditionally made with sheep`s milk, goat`s milk, or a blend of the two, Halloumi originated on Cyprus centuries ago. Its unique texture is achieved via a second heating during the production process. The cheese is onlypressed for a short time, resulting in a higher-than-usual pH (around 5.8), before it`s dipped in hot whey, which kills the starter bacteria and prevents further development of acid (meaning that calcium phosphate flows out of the cheese). That ensures a strong, rigid protein network which doesn`t melt when heated, making Halloumi a stellar cheese to grill or sear.Halloumi is by definition mild and salty, but the most authentic versions will yield some added complexity: think whey, mint, milk, and barnyard.This summery cheese is lovely served fresh alongside watermelon, but its non-melting texture makes it a stellar cooking cheese, too. We love it marinated with mushroom and drizzled with truffle honey; sautéed and served as a crostini; or wedged into aspicy eggplantsandwich."

Fresh milk is delivered each day in a tank, and pasteurized in Luizzi Angeloni`s facility in Hamden, Connecticut. The final product is a creamy artisanal Ricotta that has placed first in its ACS category two years in a row. “When you put it in your plate, it’s absolute smoothness,” says Frank Angeloni. “There’s no grittiness.” Hand Dipped Ricotta is sold in traditional metal tins, which were the norm from the 1920s to the 1950s until plastic packaging became popular. Luizzi Angeloni is one of only a few Ricotta manufacturers still using these metal tins. Luizzi Cheese–Caseficio Moderno was a shop and cheesemaking operation founded by Pasquale “Lino” Luizzi, an Italian immigrant from Bari, Italy in 1981. Lino’s family continued to run the business until 2008, when they partnered with Frank Angeloni, a cheesemaker with 48 years of experience in the Italian cheesemaking business, to form Luizzi Angeloni Cheese Company. Since then, the Connecticut-based operation has extended their market to many cities around the U.S. and won eight awards at ACS.The creamy cheese is delicious eaten with fruit, in a cheesecake, or as a filling for ravioli or manicotti."
Hanfmutschli,Kaeserei Steinen,Switzerland,Emmentaler,"5 ins diameter, 2 ins high",1 lb,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Created in 2005 by two young cheesemakers, Mike Glauser and Juerg Wyss, Hanfmutschli or “the joint” is produced in the Emmental region of Central Switzerland. The unique feature of the cheese is that the interior paste contains hemp oil and is studded with roasted hemp seeds. In addition, the top rind surface displays an imprint of a hemp or cannabis leaf. Despite this, the cheese contains no hallucinogenic characteristics due the heating of the seeds during the cheesemaking process. For production, raw cow’s milk from the local co-operative is delivered to the cheese plant. at 6.00am. It is filtered and tested before being heated to 90?F. An hour and a half later, the milk coagulates and is then cut into quite large pieces to preserve the moisture. Shortly afterwards, the hemp seeds are sprinkled into the cut curd which is then transferred into molds where it frains naturally for several hours. After unmolding, the cheeses are transferred to a maturing cellar where they are washed with salt water to encourage the development of the Bacterium Linens rind. Aging takes about 5-6 weeks before the cheeses are released. The texture of Hanfmutschli is semi soft and slightly springy with an interior paste the color of old ivory, punctuated with hemp seeds. The rind is a soft orange-brown, with the distinctive hemp leaf design on the top surface. Flavors are mild, with refreshing, creamy notes that balance the delicate nuttiness of the hemp seeds."
Hannahbells,Shy Brothers Farm,United States,Massachusetts,"1 inch high, 1/2 inch diameter",0.2 oz,www.shybrothersfarm.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Shy Brothers Farm, located at the eastern tip of Massachusetts, is owned by the Santos brothers, two sets of fraternal twins who are third generation dairy farmers. The farm is situated directly between the confluence of two rivers and close to the Atlantic coast. The climate is relatively temperate due to the Gulf Stream and also affected by the salt air – both factors that impact the grass which in turn affects the flavor of the milk and the cheese. Named for the brothers’ shy nature, the farm is also home to 120 milking cows that consist of three different breeds; Holstein, Ayrshire and Jersey. In recent years the brothers have been introducing more Ayrshire genetics into the mix since Ayrshire milk is ideal for cheesemaking. The four brothers all share most of the jobs on the farm with Karl taking responsibility for the cheesemaking. After many years of dairy farming and having produced milk that was sold on the open market, in 2006 the Santos brothers found they we no longer able to make a living due to falling milk prices. Having looked at various ways to add value to the milk, they hit upon the idea of making cheese. Karl attended a weekend cheesemaking class in New Hampshire, a course at the Vt Institute of Artisanal Cheese and made a two week trip to France to visit various cheesemakers. It was while he was in the Burgundy region that he was introduced to the recipe for making the tiny, thimble-sized cheeses known locally as “boutons de culottes” or “trouser buttons”. Even though the French farmer and cheesemaker spoke no English, and Karl spoke no French, they communicated on the quality of the herd, the herd`s diet, the climate, and the cheesemaking technique. Karl then returned to Massachusetts bringing the recipe and adapted it to suit their environment and milk quality, naming the cheese “Hannahbells” after their mother. Whereas the French cheeses tended to be dry and quite salty, Karl’s cheeses have a creamy mouthfeel and less salt. The brothers began making this cheese because its completely different from anything else on the US market and it also has a quick turnaround time, thereby increasing cash flow for the business. Karl makes one or two batches of Hannahbells per week, using 132 gallons of milk (or 1150 pounds) for each batch. For production, the curd for Hannahbells is allowed to acidify and develop over a four day period. This is an unusual practice even in Europe and the Santos brothers are the only ones to be making cheese in this way in the United States. On the fourth day, the curd is gently placed into individual molds and left to drain for a further 24 hours. After being unmolded, they are put on clean plastic mats and sprayed with a Geotricum culture to promote rind development. The cheeses then flipped every day for five days to achieve the optimum moisture level needed for flavor development. Hannahbells are made in four varieties: “French” which is the original version with no added flavors, Lavender flowers, Rosemary, and Shallot (pictured left to right in the image). There is also Chipotle flavor (not pictured) and proprietary flavors such as saffron are made on request.The cheeses have a firm and slightly chalky texture when young, becoming smoother with age. Flavors are rich and deep, varying with the addition of spices and herbs. According to Barbara Hanley, who works closely with the Santos brothers, Hannahbells are very good to cook with since they have a big flavor profile. Barbara suggests using them placed in mushroom caps or scooped baby potato halves or on a cheese plate accompanied by a fig or balsamic vinegar."
Harbison,Jasper Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,"4” diameter, 1.25” tall",.66 lbs,www.jasperhillfarm.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Harbison is the newest cheese made by Jasper Hill and is named after Anne Harbison, a local activist and grandmother figure in Greensboro, Vermont. She’s known Jasper Hill`s Kehler brothers since they were children. This delicate cheese is held together by spruce bark that`s collected from the woodlands on the Jasper Hill property. The bark not only acts as a support for the cheese, but it also lends a woodsy essence to the paste. Located in the beautiful, rolling countryside of Vermont`s Northeast Kingdom, Jasper Hill Farm was bought by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler in 1998. When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 45 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down provides a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses,and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars—made up of 22,000 square feet of cheese-maturing caves—were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature cheese forseveral Vermont-based producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Moses Sleeper, and Winnimere.Harbison is herbaceous and bright in flavor. When ripe, the paste is so soft that it can be spooned out onto a warm baguette. For a nice contrast, serve it with either stone-ground mustard or fruit preserves made of apple, stone fruits, or berries.Beverage pairings include light-bodied reds such as Gamay, full-bodied whites with some oak such as Savagnin or Arneis, and beers such as saison, wheat beer, lambic, and IPAs."
Harbourne Blue,Ticklemore Cheese ,United Kingdom,Devon,"8 ins diameter, 6 ins high",7 lbs, www.ticklemorecheese.co.uk,Goat,,BlueFirm,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Harbourne Blue is the creation of Robin Congdon who has farmed in the Sharpham area of Devon, England for the past 30 years. Harbourne is one of only a handful of blue goat`s milk cheeses made in Britain.Made from heat-treated, full fat goat`s milk, the production of Harbourne includes the addition of the Penicillium Roqueforti culture while the milk is being heated. After coagulation, the curd is cut, stirred and allowed to rest before it is broken by hand and packed into molds.After pressing, the surface of the cheeses are salted and pierced to allow air into the cheese. The air reacts with the enzymes and bacteria naturally present, and allows for the development of the delicate, blue veining before wheels are finally wrapped in foil prior to being sold.The texture of Harbourne is dense, close and firm, yet pleasantly creamy. The interior is ivory-colored with a straw-colored hue, threaded with blue veins and pockets.Flavors are spicy and assertive, and, as Robin himself admits, Harbourne can vary considerably in strength throughout the season. For this reason it can overwhelm milder cheeses, therefore it is advisable to serve it last, or alone with a robust wine."

Princess is still involved with sales and special events for the creamery.Ploughgate occupies a building that was an existing creamery, and which Marisa and Princess bought from a cheesemaking couple that were on the verge of retirement. Together they renovated the building and started their own business.Both sheep`s and cow`s milk is currently sourced from small local dairies, although there are plans to develop the Creamery`s own herd within the next few years. Ayrshire cow`s milk is used for production of Hartwell, and comes from a 50 animal herd owned by the Hancock family, located about 18 miles away. It is a small, family run farm, that has been operating on the same land for the last 99 years.Marisa produces a small range of cow`s and sheep`s milk cheeses, the first of which was Hartwell, named for a pond near the creamery.The vision for Hartwell arose from a shared passion for bloomy rinded cheeses. Made from organic, pasteurized cow`s milk, much in the style of a camembert, Hartwell is a soft, mold ripened cheese. The rind is predominently white, but, in the style of many Normandy Camemberts, is also mottled with pale, brown patches that appear when the cheese is at its peak.At a relatively young age, Hartwell is transferred to The Cellars at Jasper Hill for further maturation to the point of sale.The texture of Hartwell is smooth and yielding and the interior is china-white in color.Flavors are clean, rich and accessible but complex, with notes of earth, mushrooms and barnyard and a long, pleasing finish."

Havarti (Danish),Denmark's Tradition,Denmark,Vejle,"12 ins long, 4 ins diameter",12 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Waxed,,,"Although Havarti has become somewhat ubiquitous today, much of it taking the form of mildly flavored Cream Havarti produed on a large scale, traditional Havarti was originally made in small quantities, often on the farm or small dairy, and had a fuller, deeper flavor. The traditional version originated in Denmark in the mid 1800’s, when Hanne Nielsen, a farmer, decided to travel around Europe in order to learn the art of cheesemaking. Once back at her own farm at Havarthigaard, north of Copenhagen, she produced a cheese that she named after the farm, giving rise to Havarti. The version featured here is stylistically close to Nielsen’s cheese and is made by a second generation cheesemaker at a dairy in Syddanmark that was founded in 1909. Having been a cooperative for many years, the business was running into trouble when it was bought out by the current family owners in 1959. Private enterprise is extremely unusual in Denmark with approximately 95% of cheese production taking place within a cooperative environment. This traditionally produced, smear-ripened Havarti is produced using four cheese vats. After the milk has coagulated, the curd is pumped out of the vats onto draining tables, where the whey is left to drain out naturally without pressing. Once drained, the curd is put into loaf-shaped molds and flipped several times over the course of 24 hours in a warm environment to expel more whey. Cheeses are unmolded and placed in a brine solution for 48 hours before being allowed to mature for between five and eight weeks. During the aging process, cheeses are smear-ripened by being dipped into a mixture of potato starch, water and bacterial cultures. Before dipping, cheeses are white in color and fourteen days later having been dipped at regular intervals, they are bright orange. Before being released for sale, cheeses are scraped to remove the smear-ripened crust that forms and a delicate coating of wax applied to the exterior.The texture of this Havarti is semi-firm and the paste is dotted with small “eyes” or holes that tend to distribute themselves horizontally throughout the cheese. Flavors are buttery and nutty, accompanied by a pleasant underlying funk – a result of the smear-ripening process."

Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats.Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition.Heat is Sweet Grass Dairy’s take on pepper cheese, but they have upped the ante on this one. A combination of Ancho and Pasilla peppers are blended with Chipotle and Paprika into a paste, which is then stirred into the curds. It is then aged for at least 60 days during which time it develops a marbled appearance and a crumbly texture.The aroma of this cheese is of intense chili peppers and smoke. Heat is mild at first, but slowly develops heat on the tongue. It has a smoky flavor behind the spice.This cheese is best paired with an IPA or Ale when it comes to beer. For a wine option, an off-dry white such as a Gewurtztraminer or on the opposite side, a bold red like a Malbec.  Heat is a good cooking cheese as it melts very well. It can be used in many Mexican dishes including tacos."

Owners George Boyes and Debra Amrein-Boyes run the farmstead operation along with their adult children. Debra, cheesemaker and cookbook author, is one of only twelve persons in western Canada and the U.S. who has been inducted into the prestigious French Cheese Guild known as Guilde des Fromagers Confrerie de Saint-Uguzon.  The Boyes family’s herd of Guernsey and Brown Swiss cows and goats graze in grass fields during summer and on organic hay in winter. No pesticides, hormones or antibiotics are used on the farm. Heidi is an Alpine-style cheese that is only produced during summer months, when the cows are grazing on lush pasture. During the first period of aging, wheels are washed periodically with a whey-based brine solution, and later in the aging process they’re simply brushed. Wheels are aged for a minimum of 8 months, but are really best enjoyed after 12 months.When ready for sale, Heidi has a smooth golden paste and a rich flavor. Sweetness and saltiness are balanced with aromas redolent of summer grasses.Pair Heidi with a Chardonnay, a Beaujolais or a Pinot Noir."

Today the company, located in Radeberg in Saxony, has grown into a mid-sized cheesemaking cooperative. German product importer Fond O’ Foods is the exclusive importer of the cheese to the U.S. This Bierkäse is supposedly based on an old recipe that dates back to the 1990s. A bit of local Radeberger beer is added to fresh curd before the cheese is formed in a barrel shape. The little “kegs” of cheese are rubbed with a mixture of beer and salt during an initial aging period, then covered in a black wax coating as ripening continues.With buttery, yeasty and vegetal notes, the wax-coated, barrel-shaped cheese has a powerful but pleasant flavor that reminds us of crouton-topped French onion soup or an onion bagel.It would go fantastically with a malty German beer, of course."

Flavors are rich, sharp, and guaranteed to please garlic lovers.While its strong aromas make Herbal Jack completely snackable solo, 5 Spoke staff recommend pairing it with a riesling or a Hennepin beer."
Herbes de Provence (Everona Dairy),Everona Dairy,United States,Virginia,"4” tall, 8” diameter",6 lbs,www.everonadairy.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"It is rare indeed that a dog began a dairy, but that is exactly what happened in the case of Everona Dairy. At a Food Festival in 1992, the late Dr. Patricia (Pat) Elliot came upon a demonstration of the skills of Border Collies and was so impressed, she took a puppy home with her. Soon it became obvious that the dog needed something to keep occupied, and what is the best thing to keep a Border Collie occupied? Sheep. So, sheep were purchased and in time began to drain the good doctor’s bank account. In an effort to have the sheep pay for themselves, Dr. Elliot began milking them with a view to developing a cheesemaking operation. Whereas some people might be daunted by the prospect of taking on an additional new cheesemaking career with no previous knowledge of sheep or making cheese, Dr. Elliot was undeterred. A medical doctor who had raised seven children and adopted two others, while simultaneously putting herself through medical school, she was well equipped with the determination to teach herself how to make cheese. Pat was also a life-long DIYer and, after reading books on the topic, at age 67 took classes at the University of Wisconsin to learn the scientific side of cheese making.  By 1996, she had also travelled to Greece for further education. While it took a long time to reach the skill-level necessary to produce great cheese, in 2005 the ACS awarded Everona‘s Piedmont with its top honors in the Farmhouse Sheep’s milk cheese category. Until her death in 2013 at age 85, Dr. Elliot continued to practice medicine as well as helping to run the Dairy with her son, Brian, and daughter-in-law, Carolyn. Herbs de Provence is a twist on Everona’s signature cheese, Piedmont. This raw sheep’s milk cheese has had a mixture of 11 herbs and spices added to the curd during production. The herbs enhance the already nutty, floral and earthy paste of this 2 to 4-month old cheese with the complementary flavors of Herbs de Provence. The cheese has a light orange rind and dark ivory paste with herbs heavily sprinkled throughout.This cheese is versatile when if comes to pairing with wine. It is delicate enough to have with dry whites, but also will work with earthy reds such as Pinot Noir. Serve Herbs de Provence with Sockeye Salmon, or smoked meats. Or, it is wonderful melted over the top of roasted potatoes, especially when served with roasted chicken."

Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lived. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today Maplebrook Farm is located in Bennington, Vermont, and it is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Maplebrook Farm’s Burrata is made using the traditional techniques of a stretched curd cheese, very similar to Mozzarella, pulled into a sheet. The sheet of cheese then has fresh cream and stracciatelli (shreds of Mozzarella curds) placed in the center. In this variety, the shreds and cream are mixed with Herbes de Provence. The sheet of stretched curd is then wrapped around the filling and pinched off at the top. The result is a ball of cheese that when cut, spills its creamy contents onto the plate.Creamy on the inside but firm and chewy on the outside, herbs take this Burrata in a welcomed savory direction. Smell is fresh and slightly herbal, while on the palate flavors of of basil, sage and oregano are more robust.This cheese would be a great topping for a margherita pizza, combining the classic mozzarella with herb seasonings. For drink pairings, try it with a pinot grigio."
Herbs de Humboldt,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,Northern California,Size: 3 ins diameter. 1 inch high,4 oz,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,FlavoredNone,,,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Cypress Grove produces a variety of fresh, flavored chevres, each of which have their own distinct identity and name, mirroring the ingredients used as well as the company’s play on words. For production, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are then added. The mixture is moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt and formed into disks. Herbs and other flavorings are added by hand. The disks are then vacuum sealed, labeled and sent directly to market without aging. Cypress Grove’s Fresh Chevre is available in several varieties; Ms Natural, Purple Haze, Herbs de Humboldt, Sgt Pepper and PsycheDillic that known collectively as the Flashback Family of Chevre. Herbs de Humboldt is made using a hand-blended mix of Herbs de Provence that is applied to the exterior of the cheese.Flavors are earthy, floral and delicately herbaceous."

Heublumen,Käserei Stofel,Switzerland,St Gallen ,"12 ins diameter, 3 ins high",14 lbs,www.bergmilch.ch,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Herbed,,,"Founded in 1983, Käserei Stofel is located in the town of Unterwasser in the north-eastern part of the canton (region) of St Gallen in Switzerland. There, second generation cheesemaker, Thomas Stadelmann makes a variety of cheeses and dairy products such as yogurts from organic milk at his small, family owned dairy. Stadelmann trained as a cheesemaker in the western area of Switzerland by making Gruyere. Then in 2000, he took over the running and operation of the family dairy from his father. By nature, Thomas has a passion for creating new and original cheeses, many of which have won multiple awards.Named Heublumen after the German word for “hayflower” in which the cheese is coated, this cheese is a riff on some of the more traditional Swiss Alpine style cheeses found in the region.For production of Heublumen, organic milk is heated in a copper vat and starter cultures and rennet are added. After the curd is cut and the excess whey drained off, large blocks of curd are placed into cheese forms and pressed. After pressing, the newly formed wheels are soaked in a brine solution for twenty four hours in order to expel more whey and to help with the formation of a rind.The wheels are then transferred to a maturing room where they are matured for two months before a dense coat of bits of hay is applied to the outside. Stadelmann has a proprietory method for ensuring the hay remains stuck to the outsode of the cheese and doesn’t fall off.The cheeses are then aged for a further two months before release. During this time, they are regularly brushed to keep any mold from developing.By the time Heublumen is released for sale, the interior of the cheese is pale straw colored with a firm texture dotted with occasional small holes or “eyes”.  The exterior rind is a dark green/brown in color and flecked with small pieces of hay. Flavors are milky and delicate with notes of sweet, raw almonds becoming more woodsy and barnyard-like near the rind."

In the process of searching for a good milk source in order to begin making cheese, they found that they were unable to get the quality that they wanted. So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced.Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012.Named after the Baptist church at the end of their street, Hickory Grove is a raw Trappist style cow’s milk cheese. It has a deep ochre rind covering the rich yellow paste. It has a slightly pliant texture with a toothsome snap. The rounded buttery flavors develop more complexity as the paste lingers on the tongue.Given that this is a Trappist style cheese, the best pairing is a good Trappist-style Ale or Cider. Serve the cheese with some sliced apples for a bright contrast. This is a wonderful cheese for melting, whether it be on burgers, or in Mac n’ Cheese."

Hildene Farm Chevre,Hildene Farm,United States,Vermont,Various,3 oz & 6 oz,www.hildene.org ,Goat,,Soft,Animal,None,,,"The Hildene Estate (now Hildene, The Lincoln Family Home) was the home of Robert Todd Lincoln, the son of Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln. It was built in Manchester, Vermont in 1905. At the time, Robert was the President of the Pullman Company; the largest manufacturing firm in the world at the time.The name Hildene is an Old English term meaning hill and valley with a stream. Robert, who had also served as an Amabssador to the Court of St. James’ as well as Secretary of War in the 1880s and 1890s, lived on the estate until his death in 1926. The home remained in the Lincoln family until 1975 when the last descendant to live at the estate, Mary Lincoln Beckwith, died. Three years later, after a long struggle, Friends of Hildene, a non-profit organization purchased the estate to save it from development and to restore the house and grounds. The estate now serves as a historic house in Vermont with tours and educational programs for children.Part of the Estate is the Rowland Agricultural Center at Hildene Farm, or Hildene Farm for short. The Farm’s mission is to educate visitors on the agricultural heritage of the estate, which included the presence of a herd of dairy cows and other livestock. It is also tasked with connecting farming heritage with the 21st century need to utilize green practices in farming. This includes using solar power for the farm’s energy needs and education on sustainable farming, renewable clean energy and forest management.Hildene Farm Chevre is made by hand from the milk of the farm’s herd of 25 milking does. The goats are milked twice a day, once in the early morning and once late in the afternoon, from April to December. Demonstrations on how the goats are milked are part of Hildene Farm’s public tours and educational programs, so the milking times were adjusted to ensure that the children participating in the program are able to see how goats are milked.It takes four milkings to gather enough to make a batch of the Chevre. Once enough milk is collected, typically around 48 hours after the initial milking, it is pasteurized and allowed to cool.Cultures and a minute amount of rennet are then added to the milk and it is divided into small, 4-gallon containers that are covered and allowed to rest overnight. During this time, the milk coagulates into a semi-solid mass. The cheesemakers closely monitor this coagulated milk until it reaches a specific pH level. Then it is hand-ladled into molds without cutting or stirring. The newly molded cheeses are allowed to drain while in their molds for a full day.They are then transported to a cool, temperature controlled room, where they are removed from their molds, salted and left to drain on cheese matting. Over the course of an additional two days, the cheeses are salted and flipped a few more times until the flavor and consistency are correct.This cheese-making process is vital to the educational program at Hildene Farm. Students from local schools are invited to visit the farm throughout the year, where they are able to see the cheese-making facility through a glass-enclosed space. They are able to interact with the goats and also participate in a class where they learn about goat health and help make cheese. Students are then able to sample Hildene Farm Chevre.This Chevre has a very rich, dense, almost cream cheese like consistency. Its flavors are generally light and clean, but there are seasonal variations. In the spring, the cheese will have more of a lemon-like tang, while the Chevre produced in the autumn will be more buttery in flavor.Not surprisingly, this Chevre pairs beautifully with French Sauvignon Blanc, especially Sancerre with its bright, mineral characteristics. The cheese is particularly good when served at room temperature on top Avocado chips."

It is off the grid, and powered by solar and hydro-electric systems installed by Vern, a former career Marine.The dairy herd consists of about 30 milking goats. The Caldwells initially chose Nigerian Dwarfs for a 4H project for their young daughter (due to their managable size). Several years later, Gianaclis and Vern find themselves with one of the best herds in the country. They have worked hard on improving genetics and the goats lead a happy life, listening to National Public Radio and jazz, and grazing at pasture for as much of the year as the weather permits.Gianaclis makes cheese in a room adjacent to (but separated from) the milking parlor and the main barn. The quality of the goats` milk is outstanding and Gianclis approaches cheesemaking in a very methodical and diligent way.Made from raw milk, Hillis Peak is named after the pioneer mountain that looks over Evans Valley and Pholia Farm to the east. It is a washed curd cheese that develops complex flavors and aromas during aging. Wheels weigh aapproximately 2.5lbs.The cheeses have a natural rind that is formed as a result of regular rubbing with olive or vegetable oil and smoked Spanish Paprika during the aging process.The texture of Hillis Peak is semisoft and very smooth, dense and supple with occasional holes. The paste is bone-white in color.Flavors at six to eight months of age are reminiscent of a Basque sheep`s milk cheese.

During production, curds are cooked and pressed. This process expels more whey and creates the dense, tight texture characteristic of mountain cheeses.Finished wheels of Hoch Ybrig weigh approximately 16lbs., considerably less than the 80lb. Gruyère. The smaller size has two main advantages: the wheels are easier for retailers to manage and they also age faster. Hoch Ybrig is usually released at eight months of age, whereas the best Gruyères are matured for up to 16-20 months.Hoch Ybrig is selected and matured by famous Swiss affineur Rolf Beeler. Wheels imported into the United States are brough in by Swiss native, Caroline Hostettler, who likes to keep them until they`re at least a year old. Throughout their maturation, the wheels are washed with brine that contains white wine, which, Hostettler claims, creates the cheese`s sweet finish.At one year, the interior paste of the cheese is a deep, golden straw color, becoming slightly darker towards the rind, which is thin and dark-ochre in color.The texture is very smooth, dense and slightly supple. There are occasional holes, or ""eyes,""` and some cheeses develop a few crunchy granules that are the result of crystallized amino acids.Flavors of Hoch Ybrig are concentrated and sweet, with a perfect, fine balance of salt and acidity. There are also definitive caramel and butterscotch notes."
Hoelzerne Geiss,Willi Schmid ,Switzerland,Lichtensteig,"4 ins diameter, 2 ins high, ",1.5 lbs,www.rolfbeeler.ch/e-index.php,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,Washed,,,"Although Willi Schmid has only had his own dairy since 2006, in a short amount of time he has become an extremely well known cheese maker in Switzerland. Every morning before making any one of his two-dozen cheeses, he tastes the raw milk to determine which one it will be best in. Mr. Schmid is passionate about using only raw milk that he collects personally from local dairy farmers. He also allows the cheeses he creates to age in his cellar until they are ready to send out to affineurs and vendors. The result of his uncompromising dedication to quality is that Willi Schmid’s cheeses are some of the best in Switzerland. For the last thirty years, Rolf Beeler has had a small cheese booth located in Lucerne, Switzerland, that is dedicated to selling fine Swiss cheeses. Mr. Beeler works solely with small-scale cheesemakers. Although some producers are still dedicated to making very traditional Swiss cheeses, Beeler also works with many new and innovative cheesemakers. These producers have emerged in the last fifteen years as a direct result of the easing of strict regulations surrounding Swiss cheese production. Beeler, in partnership with Caroline Hostettler, was among the first to introduce quality artisanal Swiss cheese to America. He is a highly acclaimed affineur (one who matures cheese) as well as Master Cheesemonger and has been dubbed by his peers as “Switzerland’s Pope of Cheese.” Hoelzerne Geiss translates to Wooden Goat, referring to the band of spruce that is wrapped around the cheese. Made in a similar way to Bergfitche (see separate entry), a Swiss cow’s milk cheese, Hoelzerne Geiss is aged for 8 weeks. Like all washed rind cheeses, it has a pungent aroma, intensified by the fact that it is made from goat’s milk.The top rind of the cheese can be cut away to reveal an unctuous and runny interior paste, which can then be spooned onto warm bread.  Its flavor is a balance of tangy, slightly acidic goat’s milk, and the spruce wood, which imparts a pine-like nuance to the cheese. The result is complex and interesting.Hoelzerne Geiss is a cheese that can stand-up to a heavy red wine such as a bold Cabernet Sauvignon or the opposite, such as an Alsatian Riesling.  Serve it with fresh fruit such as apples or pears."
Hoja Santa,The Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,"2.5 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",5 oz,www.mozzco.com,Goat,,Soft,Microbial,Leaf Wrapped,,,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, one of which is Hoja Santa. Paula’s inspiration for the creation of her Hoja Santa cheese came from Patricia Quintana, a chef in Mexico City (Izote). Patricia uses hoja santa leaves, which are native to Veracruz and Oaxaca, for wrapping fish and chicken, which are then steamed over a smoldering fire pit, dug in the ground. After tasting this dish, Paula was captivated by the idea and, having seen French cheesemakers using a similar technique with chestnut leaves, decided to try adopting the concept with hoja santa leaves. Milk for cheesemaking is sourced directly from a number of goat dairies located across the state border in Oklahoma. The goats are Saanen and a La Mancha mix – both breeds well known for their excellent milk production. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized and starter cultures and microbial rennet are added to the milk and stirred in. The milk is left to coagulate slowly overnight, and the following day the curd is carefully hand-ladled into small, perforated molds. The gentle handling of the curd greatly helps to preserve moisture and its delicate structure, which in turn contributes to the texture of the finished cheese. The curd is left to drain in the molds for 24 hours before being turned out onto cheese mats where they are dry salted and left to drain further. The cheeses are turned and salted daily to encourage even drainage of the whey and, when they’re ready, wrapped in the fragrant hoja santa leaves and tied with raffia to resemble small, green parcels. The leaves from the hoja santa plant, also sometimes known as Mexican pepperleaf, are sourced from local organic growers and harvested until the first frost in November. The leaves are large and aromatic with the result that the flavors subtly permeate the cheese while they mature. Cheeses are aged for between one and six months and are therefore available all year. When young, the texture tends to be slightly chalky and crumbly. With time, the texture breaks down, becoming creamier and smoother. The flavors of Hoja Santa are fresh, milky and tangy with distinct vegetal notes and interesting flavors of mint and pepper from the sassafras leaf. The flavors intensify with age but never become overwhelming. Aside from serving the Hoja Santa on a cheese plate, Paula also recommends gently heating a whole cheese so that when the leaf is cut the warm cheese flows out onto the plate."

There are several cheesemakers in the town. However, the cheesemaker that produces Hollandse Creme is also called Rouveen and he produces a few different cheeses on a small scale, all of which are made along the lines of Gouda recipes.For production of Hollandse Creme, Rouveen uses only full fat whole milk. This gives the cheese a particularly rich, milky and buttery flavor as well as a texture that has a much softer mouthfeel than traditional Goudas."

Having owned the farm for a number of years, MacAlistair started milking cows and experimenting with cheesemaking in 1997 with a view to keeping the farm alive and sustainable. Two years later in 1999, Gillman left his job to join her and, after they had each taken several workshops and courses, they were able to begin cheese production in earnest. Gillmanis the primary cheesemaker at Cato Corner and is also responsible for the cheese aging, while MacAlistair manages the farm and milking. The farm is home to a mixed herd of 45 Jersey cows that graze outside from May to the end of October. During the winter months they eat only natural fodder and supplements. All the cheeses are made by hand in small batches from raw milk. Mark makes a variety of cheeses, the style of each type being suited to the seasonal components and characteristics of the milk. One of these cheeses, a particularly stinky washed rind wheel called Hooligan, lives up to its name. During an aging period of 60-75 days, it`s washed repeatedly in a brine solution to encourage the development of a bright orange surface.The interior has a high moisture content when young and a slightly chalky center with a tendency for the paste to break down and become softer just under the rind. Flavors at this point are pleasingly grassy, savory and vegetal. With age, these characteristics are accentuated. The paste becomes much more runny, and the flavors of the cheese become more assertive. Not for the faint hearted!Melt a wedge of Hooligan on top of cranberry-walnut bread, slather it with hot pepper jelly or serve it alongside a Belgian-style ale."

While taking care of a friend’s goats, Sara fell in love. Her affection for animals resulted in the acquisition of various pets together with a small herd of dairy goats. Shortly afterwards, inspired by tasting another friend’s cheeses, Sara started to experiment with making her own.About ten years later, Sara and her husband Denny were one of the first farms in Texas to file the necessary paperwork with the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) as a “Certified Organic Farm.” Sara came up with the farm name, decalring it was “Pure Luck that it worked”!The batches of cheese that Sara made for family and friends were so well received that in 1995, she made the major transition to start a Grade A Goat Dairy. Since then, Pure Luck’s dedication to quality and the family’s love for the goats have resulted in several national cheese honors. Although tragically, Sara died in 2005, her passion and love of the farm remains with her family, with her daughter Amelia heading the cheesemaking operation.Pure Luck Dairy’s Hopelessly Bleu is named for Amelia’s sister Hope, who always refused to eat this particular cheese. Hopelessly Bleu is produced between March and October each year. It is made from pasteurized milk, innoculated during the heating process with Pencilium Candidum and P. Roqueforti cultures. Cheeses are then ripened for between 8-12 weeks before release. At this point, each wheel has an attractively mottled, undulating, blue-grey rind.The interior is ivory white in color, shot through with pale blue veins. The texture is soft and yielding with a full, cream-like mouthfeel.In terms of flavor, this cheese is renowned for being a “gateway blue”.  In other words, its mild and slightly sweet flavors appeal to many people either trying goat’s milk cheeses or blue cheeses for the first time.  Rich notes of butter, milk and gentle hint of blue are characteristic of this cheese."

Hot Pepper Jack,Carr Valley Cheese Co. Inc. ,United States,Wisconsin,,10 lbs ,www.carrvalleycheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,,,,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.In the 1980s, Sid and father decided to spice things up by adding red and green Jalapenos to their popular Monterey Jack. The resulting Hot Pepper Jack was a great success, so great that it’s now made in both original and smoked varieties.Hot Pepper Jack has a spicy and robust flavor that balances well with the smooth jack cheese.Sid says that this cheese pairs dangerously well with beer, and is therefore perfect for tailgaiting. “If you eat the cheese you want to take the heat away with some beer,” he says, “but then the beer makes it hotter, so then you drink more beer, and then you have to have more cheese.”"

The farm was originally purchased in 1971 by Bob and Letty Kilmoyer who ran it as a cheesemaking operation until 1996, when the Stetsons bought the business. After one month`s intensive apprenticeship with the Kilmoyers, they took over Westfield Farm and have continued and expanded production ever since.Sourcing both goat`s and cow`s milk from local dairies, Westfield Farm produces slightly over 1,500lbs. of cheese per week.Hubbardston Blue can be made from either cow`s or goat`s milk, and the two versions switch out seasonally to keep up with demand. Unlike the Classic Blue Log that receives its inoculation of Penicilium Roqueforti mold on the surface of the young cheese, milk used for the production of Hubbardston Blue is inoculated while still in the vat.Hubbardston Blue is a surface ripened blue cheese that develops a very soft and creamy center upon ripening.When mature, the rind of the cheese is covered by a powdery, blue-gray mold that encases a bright, white interior.The interior paste is soft and almost mousse-like when young, becoming more yielding and runny with age.The blue mold on the exterior of the cheese results in complex flavors that are reminiscent of truffles and mushrooms, with a blue tasting, lactic tang."
Huckleberry Blue,Prairie Fruits Farm,United States,Illinois,"5.5 ins diameter, 2.5 ins high",6 lbs,www.prairiefruits.com,Goat,,Firm,Animal,Leaf Wrapped,,,"Prairie Fruits Farm was founded in 2003 by the husband and wife team of Wes Jarrell and Leslie Cooperband, who left academic and urban lives in Madison, WI to run a farm in Champaign Urbana, IL.With a focus on organic and sustainable farming, Wes and Leslie set about restoring the 7-acre farm’s soils that had been previously used for cash grain crops. A task that in 2004 led them to plant 350 fruit trees, 600 berry plants, and the purchase of their first Nubian goats. In 2005, they were licensed as a Grade A goat dairy and farmstead creamery. Since then, Wes and Leslie have grown the farm to more than 40 acres and expanded their goat herd to around 70 milking does of both the Nubian and La Mancha breeds.While the couple uses milk from their own herd, they also purchase sheep’s milk from the only licensed sheep dairy in the state. With the goat and sheep’s milk cheeses that Prairie Fruits Farm produces, they are dedicated to highlighting the terroir of Central Illinois.Made from raw goat’s milk, Huckleberry Blue is an aged blue-veined cheese with a natural rind sometimes encased in sycamore leaves. The name was inspired by one of Prairie Fruits Farm’s foundation Nubian milking does “Huckleberry.” She’s an assertive, strong-willed doe and both her coloring and personality match the bold, blue flavors of this cheese. Cheeses are made seasonally between early spring and late fall. This allows cheesemaker Leslie Cooperband to take advantage of the naturally high solids in the seasonal goat milk - and particularly the high butterfat content.The blue veins in Huckleberry Blue develop as a result of the inclusion of starter culture Penicillium Roqueforti which is added as the milk is heated for cheesemaking.Wheels are offered for sale with or without a wrapping of sycamore leaves. If applied, this happens after about 1 month of age, with leaves that come from a tree on the farm. The leaves are then soaked in a local, organic pear brandy sourced from Koval Distillery in Chicago IL. As the cheeses mature, which takes a minimum of three months, wheels are pierced once to promote the development of the blue veining.This cheese pairs well with a Burgundian style red wine such as Pinot Noir. It would also pair well with an Italian Nero D’Avila."

Hudson Red,Twin Maple Farm/Pampered Cow,United States,New York,Varies,1.5 lbs or 3.0 lbs,www.pamperedcow.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Washed,,,"Hudson Red is a washed rind cheese produced at Twin Maple Farm in the famously beautiful Hudson Valley, in New York State. Although Twin Maple Farm has been continuously farmed since 1801, in 2008 part of the farm was converted to a flagship creamery for Pampered Cow, a company created to help market, promote and distribute cheeses produced within the Hudson Valley region. The business partners behind this venture are Matthew Scott, Dan Berman, and cheesemaker/owner Douglas Ginn. The inspiration for Hudson Red came from the Raclette produced at nearby Hawthorne Valley Farm, where Douglas worked previously. For production of Hudson Red, raw Jersey cow’s milk is collected from nearby Dutch Hollow Farm and brought back to Twin Maple Farm. There, the milk is transferred into a 120 gallon, Dutch style vat where it’s heated to 90°F over a period of 30 – 40 minutes when the cultures and microbial rennet are added. After coagulation, the curd is cut by hand into ½ inch cubes and then cut again using orbital blades until the pieces resemble small, pea-sized particles. The curd is cooked at a higher temperature for between 10-20 minutes before being drained and transferred into net-lined Kadova molds. Once inside the molds, the curd is kneaded and lightly pressed. The young cheeses are turned (flipped) regularly throughout the day before being left to drain overnight. The following morning, cheeses are unmolded and allowed to dry a little further before being placed in an 80% salt brine solution for between 11-13 hours depending on their size. In the evening, they are moved to racks and allowed to dry overnight. The cheeses are aged for a minimum of 60 days before release. During this time, they are flipped regularly to ensure the even distribution of moisture. They are also washed several times with a solution of salt, water and Brevibacterium Linens (the bacteria that gives washed rind cheeses their distinctive orange and sticky rind and pungent aroma). The washings take place at about 7-8 days, 10-11 days at 14 days and then once or twice each week after that. Cheeses are wrapped at between 60-90 days and stored at a temperature of 38°F until release. The texture of Hudson Red is yielding and semi-soft. The interior paste is rich ivory-yellow in color with an orange-brown, slightly sticky exterior rind. Flavors are rich and savory with toasty notes."

Parish Hill’s cheeses are inspired by the traditional cheeses of Italy. They’re handmade in small batches using raw milk, which is produced at the Elm Lea Farm at the Putney School. The farm is just five minutes down the road from the cheese house, and its milking herd grazes on fresh pasture from June to October. Parish Hill cheese production happens from May to November in order to take advantage of the pastures that give a highly aromatic quality to the milk, resulting in complex and subtle flavor variations. Milk for cheesemaking is ripened using homegrown cheese cultures, which are produced by inoculating the farm’s raw milk with pure bacterial cultures and then propagating them continuously. Traditional calf rennet is sourced from Europe and Quebec, and sea salt is sourced from the Maine Sea Salt Company in Marshfield. Humble Herdsman is a whole milk, semi-soft tomme-style cheese. During 3-5 months of aging, wheels are repeatedly washed with local hard cider.Humble Herdsman has a golden-hued rind surrounding a smooth yet dense paste spattered with small holes. Flavor is mild and nutty with grassy, vegetal notes.Pair it with a white wine from the Piedmont, such as Roero or Langhe Arneis."
Humboldt Fog,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,California,,1lb or 5lb,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,,,"Cypress Grove is located in foggy Humboldt County, in the temperate northwest coastal region of California. Its origins date back to the 1970’s, when founder Mary Keehn became interested in goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. After starting with two animals, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the herd increased significantly; finding herself with excess milk, Keehn began experimenting with cheesemaking, founding Cypress Grove in 1983. Keehn was a pioneer. At that time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US. As the company grew, Keehn decided to sell her animals to a number of local farms and buy back the milk. Today, each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring consistent high quality. As the company expanded, Keehn was approached with many acquisition offers. However none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keeping the company headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Keehn first dreamed up Humboldt Fog in 1993 after returning from a trip to Europe, inspired to create a cheese that visually echoes the typical thick white fog that frequently settles over the dark green landscape of her native Humboldt County. To make the cheese cheesemakers pasteurize goat milk in a vat where cultures and coagulants are added and held for the acid ripening process. The mixuture is then moved to a curd press where the whey is drained off. The curd is mixed with salt, hand-packed into cheese forms, ashed, and then sprayed with mold cultures. The cheeses spend ten days in primary ripening where they are turned daily, and then “cold stabilized” for several more days before being wrapped and sent to market.Apart from the horizontal line of ash, the interior paste of the cheese is snow-white in color when young, with a smooth, dense and slightly crumbly texture. With age, the paste starts to break down under the rind, becoming smoother, slightly translucent and ultimately runny. The flavors of Humboldt Fog change with age. When young, the cheese is clean, bright and lemony with a citrus-like tang. As it matures, flavors intensify and and can become quite assertive, especially just under the rind."

Humming Bark,Carrigbyrne Farmhouse Cheese,Ireland,Wexford,,5 ½ oz,www.carrigbyrne.ie,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Washed,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),," Patty Berridge learned to make cheese from his mother, in her kitchen—and from a Camembert maker he worked for in Normandy, France—before coming back to his family farm on the outskirts of Adamstown, Co. Wexford, and launching Carrigbyrne Farmhouse Cheese in 1982. Today Berridge’s daughter Jenny Malsen and her Aussie husband Dave are running the dairy together, while French native Jean-Luc Danquigny works as head cheesemaker. Inspired by the bark-wrapped cheeses of France and Switzerland, Humming Bark is a washed-rind oozing disk wrapped in a strip of spruce made with fresh milk from the farm’s own herd of 350 Friesian and Jersey-crossed cows. After cheesemakers pasteurize, culture and coagulate the milk using rennet, curd is manually scooped into molds, in which it drains for a full day before disks go into a drying room. Washed every other day until a red-orange rind develops, the small rounds gradually absorb woodsy aromas from the spruce bark that’s been sourced from France.Smelling of hard cider, resin, and sap, this small rustic cheese has a golden paste and a soft washed rind. The flavor is balanced and bright, pronounced but not overwhelming with smokier notes toward its bark-wrapped exterior and lingering woodsy, earthy notes.Pair it with crusty bread, sour beer or a dry rosé."

Hunkadora,Prodigal Farm,United States,North Carolina,,,prodigalfarm.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold RipenedAsh,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Taking a cue from traditional French Selles-sur-Cher from the Loire Valley, Hunkadora is an ash-coated goat’s milk cheese from Prodigal Farm.  Coating a fresh cheese in ash began as a traditional method for protecting the paste as a rind developed. On a chemical level, ash is a base, while the goat cheese is acidicIn helping to neutralize the pH of the cheese surface, the ash impacts maturation of the cheese.In Hunkadora, it also influences the development of a robust, lingering flavor that distinguishes the cheese not only in looks, but also in taste, from its sister cheese Candide.  Dave Krabbe and Kathryn Spann bought their 120-year-old farm in Rougemont, North Carolina and began Prodigal Farm in 2010, fulfilling Krabbe’s dreams of farming and as a return to Spann’s roots. They bought their first herd of goats to clear out the overgrowth around the old fields and barns. After producing their first batch of cheese, Krabbe and Spann invested in a larger herd and dairy, and the rest is history. Today, Prodigal Farm is well known for its use of sustainable agricultural practices and Animal Welfare Approved husbandry practices, and it shows in the quality of their products, from fresh goat cheeses to goat meat.  All Prodigal Farm’s goats are pasture-fed on the 95-acre farm and named. They are moved to a fresh pasture every few days in a gutted school bus and are rotationally grazed every nine months, ensuring the best quality milk. And Krabbe and Spann take as much care of their cheese as they do of their goats, checking and turning them daily to ensure even ripening and rind development.Hunkadora has a sweet and tangy flavor that lingers with an accent of grass and citrus. As it ripens, Hunkadora forms a delicate cream line surrounding a denser, fudgy center, making every bite a smooth, delicious journey.Drizzle with a light honey and enjoy with rosé."

Over the years, they have developed excellent dairy and milking genetics in the herd, which have greatly helped other American LaMancha dairies improve their stock.Goat`s Leap is a seasonal dairy. Cheesemaking normally commences in April and lasts until late October or early November. The cheeses that Barbara makes also reflect the seasons. Every day, weather permitting, the goats are taken out onto the hillside above the house to browse the native California shrubs and bushes.Barbara makes a variety of predominently younger, mold ripened cheeses in the tiny cheese room, just up the hill from the house.What sets Barbara`s cheeses apart is not just the flavor but their texture. Starting with very high quality milk, Barbara handles the curd for her cheeses with great dexterity that results in some of the finest, silkiest textures of any American cheeses on the market.Named after one of Barbara`s favorite goats, Hyku is an elegant goat cheese aged for about six weeks.The white, bloomy rind can become quite dense with age, but the interior paste is delicate, smooth and velvety.Flavors are herbaceous and only gently goaty, the cheese is creamy and subtle with a refreshing tang."

Extramadura is renowned as one of the most ruggedly beautiful and undeveloped regions of the country and the goats are largely allowed to roam freely, browsing on the indigenous shrubs, herbs and grasses.After pressing, the cheeses are matured for a minimum of 100 days, during which time the rinds are rubbed either with olive oil or sweet paprika, or a combination of the two. This often gives Ibores an attractive rusty colored red rind and an earthy, slightly spicy aroma.The texture is semifirm and smooth, yet the bone-white paste is punctuated with occasional holes.In terms of flavor, Ibores is a very accessible cheese. Although slightly salty, the cheese has a balanced flavor with notes of cellar, mushrooms and earth, all underpinned by a slight taste of sour cream.For pairing, Ibores matches up well with a several wines, ranging from Pouilly Fume and some of the more oaky Chardonnays through to spicy reds."
Idiazabal,Various,Spain,Basque/Navarra,"7 ins diameter, 5 ins high",6 lbs,,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Smoked,,,"Produced in the Basque and Navarre regions of northern Spain, Idiazabal is a smoked cheese made from the raw milk of Latxa or Carranzana sheep. Idiazabal’s denomination of origin has been protected since 1987, making it one of the region’s best-known products. Named for the village of Idiazabal, located in the Goierri valley, the production of the cheese originated in the high mountain pastures of the region, where it was made by the nomadic shepherds. For the duration of the summer, the shepherds would move their sheep up the mountain to graze on the lush, new grass. During this time they would milk the sheep and make cheese in mountain huts. The cheeses matured in the rafter, where fires inside the hut would impart a smoky flavor. At the end of September, the shepherds, sheep, and cheeses would all return to the lower slopes, and by this time, the cheeses were ready for sale. Today, the artisan producers of Idiazabal cheese imitate these traditional methods. After production, cheeses mature for at least two months. As a final step, the cheese can be smoked using beech or alder wood. At the time of sale, Idiazabal has a smooth, dark, yellow-brown rind and has a slightly burnt aroma. The rind carries the marks of the wooden molds in which the curd is drained. The cheese’s texture is compact, slightly waxy, and dotted with small holes. It is pleasantly supple and toothsome in the mouth.Flavors are sweet and balanced, with notes of bacon and caramel. In smoked versions, the smoke should be noticeable but should not overpower the slight sweetness and hint of acidity.Idiazabal pairs well with a simple red wine like tempranillo, dry cider, or saison."

In Your Face Cheddar,Face Rock Creamery,United States,Oregon,,40 lbs,www.facerockcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Microbial,None,Cheddar-like,Flavor added to paste,"Face Rock Creamery is located in Bandon, Oregon, in one of the oldest cheesemaking areas on the west coast. As early as the 1880s, cheese was being made in the many dairy farms in the Coquille Valley to the east of the town, and in 1936 the Bandon Cheese Factory was founded. The son of the factory’s founder, Brad Sinko, took over and ran it until 2003 when it was bought out by a larger competitor. Sinko then spent 10 years as the head cheesemaker Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle and New York. While Sinko was making cheddars in Seattle, the Bandon Cheese Factory was abandoned and torn down by the company that had purchased it. Locals in the town, including developers Greg Drobot and Daniel Graham, were disappointed to see a gravel pit where the Bandon Cheese Factory once stood. Working alongside the community and the City Council, Drobot and Graham decided to rebuild a structure that would host not only a 9,000 sq. foot creamery, but also a 2,000 sq. foot well retail space and cafe. Today cheese is being made in Bandon once again in this location, and Brad Sinko has returned as head cheesemaker. The name ‘Face Rock’ refers to a local monolithic formation on the Oregon coast that resembles a face looking up at the sky. Face Rock sources all of its milk from Scolari’s Dairy Farm in Coquille, only 15 miles from Bandon. The farm has been owned by the same family since the early 1930s, and today has a herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows. Sinko oversees the production of 1,000 pounds of cheese at Face Rock Creamery each day using traditional techniques. In production of In Your Face Cheddar, jalapeno, habanero and sweet red peppers are mixed in with the curd before the cheese is formed into 40-lb blocks. Aged in plastic coating for at least four months, In Your Face is named for itshit of spiciness.While its scent is reminiscent of a tame pepper jack, this cheddar, with its tri-colored spattering of hot peppers decorating the paste, is surprisingly spicy. Heat builds slowly amongst notes of smoke, acidity and the slight sharpness of the cheddar.Pair it with a Burgundy or with a pale ale."
Infossato,Casa Madaio,Italy,Campania,Varies,3.25 lbs,www.casamadaio.it/en.html,Sheep,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Owned by the Madaio family, Casa Madaio is an acclaimed cheese affineur (maturer) and producer located in Salerno, Italy. The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Infossato is an sheep’s milk cheese with ancient origins. Cheeses are placed in pits dug into the ground that are lined with herbs and leaves such as ferns for one year. The ferns and leaves protect the wheels as well as creating an optimum environment for maturation. In addition, the leaves contribute herbaceous aromas and flavors to the cheese. The practice of burying cheeses to age them has been dated to Etruscan times when it would have protected cheese from thieves as well as pathogens.Matching the rustic manner in which it is matured, Infossato’s appearance is a rustic sphere. It has a wrinkled brown rind with a dense light yellow paste inside. The flavor is strong, a result of the seasoning that takes place during aging in the pits. The suggested wine pairing for Infossato is Aglianico; a red wine made in the Basilico and Campania regions of Italy. It is a full-bodied red wine with high acidity and a good amount of tannins. Lager beers also work well with this cheese. Cooking suggestions include grating it over bean soups, or serving it on its own with apple jam. "
Jarlsberg,TINE SA ,Norway,Vest Elnesvagen and Sor Naerbo,"15 ins diameter, 4 ins high",22 lbs,www.jarlsbergusa.com/,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Waxed,,,"Made from pasteurized cow’s milk, Norway’s best known and most widely produced cheese is Jarlsberg. Although a couple of different legends exist about the origins of the cheese, the true development of Jarlsberg began in 1956 with research conducted by the Agricultural University of Norway. The recipe, which took ten years to perfect before being considered ready for full scale production, is based on a combination of the recipes for traditional Gouda and Swiss Emmental. The recipe has remained virtually unchanged over the decades, and still uses a blend of cheese cultures that include mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (used commonly in Gouda) and propionic bacteria (used in Emmental). The cheese was named Jarlsberg (Jarl means “Earl” in Norwegian) after the Jarlsberg Manor in Vestfold. This area is known to have been home to the site of Norway’s first dairy in 1815 and although no cheese resembling modern-day Jarlsberg was ever made there, the region became known for its dairying and cheesemaking, especially during the summer months. The original cheesemaker of Jarlsberg was dairy student named Per Sakshaug who worked under the supervision of Professor Ystgaard at the University of Norway’s Dairy School. In more recent years, production of Jarlsberg switched over to a company called Tine (pronounced “Teenah”), Norway’s largest dairy co-operative and cheese producer. Jarlsberg accounts for over 80% of all Norwegian cheese exports. Tine has taken the brand to a new level and, in addition to continuing the traditional version of Jarlsberg, has also introduced other varieties varieties such as extra aged, low fat and rindless as well as overseeing production of the cheese in the USA and Ireland. Although production of Jarlsberg is highly mechanized, the end results are consistent and widely appreciated. Milk for cheesemaking is sourced from Tine’s co-operative dairy farms and transported to the cheese plant in Tine’s milk trucks. The dairy farmers receive considerable support from the company, thus ensuring a consistent and high quality milk supply. Jarlsberg is an all-purpose cheese, good for both cooking and eating as a snack. Due to its capacity to melt easily, it is an ideal ingredient for grilled cheese sandwiches or panini.Since Jarlsberg is made from semi-skimmed milk, flavors are mild, buttery, slightly sweet and balanced.  The texture of the cheese is smooth and firm, characterized by the presence of large round holes or “eyes”.Appropriate pairings include a delicate Chenin Blanc, crisp Sauvignon Blanc or Gewurztraminer.  Soft Merlot or medium-bodied Malbec are good choices, too.   Pair with plums and apricots, figs, grapes, apple and pear, assorted hams, black, dark or rye breads and nuts."
Jeffs' Select Gouda,Maple Leaf Cheese / Caves of Faribault,United States,Wisconsin / Minnesota,11 in diameter x 4 in height,11 lbs,faribaultdairy.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,Gouda-like,,"Self-proclaimed “cheesemakers without borders” Jeff Jirik from Minnesota’s Caves of Faribault and Jeff Wideman of Maple Leaf Cheese in Wisconsin started collaborating on this aged gouda in 2009. Wideman’s team makes the 11-inch-wide wheels using forms brought over from Europe and sends them to Faribault’s famed sandstone caverns when they’re between 30 and 60 days old. After an initial month stint curing alongside the Amablu and St. Pete’s Select blues, the cheeses develop surface yeast and molds. Then they move to a less-humid affinage cave, where they’re turned frequently and wiped down for the remainder of their stay (usually about a year).“It’s very much a labor of love—it’s very, very labor-intensive,” Jirik says. “They require a lot of care”With a firm texture and a bright-orange rind created by a hand-rubbing of annatto, the resulting Gouda has a complex nut and caramel flavor with a nice amount of tang and a dash of salt on the finish. Extra-aged versions sport ruddier rinds and still-creamy, crystal-laden pastes, with flavors that come on strong with caramel-butterscotch and berry notes. But never becomes cloying: “There’s a lingering lactic hint and a touch of salt that cleans up [the palate]—it’s almost refreshing,” Jirik says. Meaning that once you start eating this gouda, you just can’t stop.Jeff Jirik still raves about a fabulous combo he tried five years ago—Jeffs’ Select Gouda with dry white wine and figs. The accompaniments “amplified the sweet notes in the cheese,” he remembers, “while the white wine clarified the sharpness and a little bit of the nuttiness and put an edge on it.”"
Jersey Blue,Willi Schmid,Switzerland,Lichtensteig,5 in diameter x 5 in height,4 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,BlueNatural,Blue,,"This dome-shaped cheese looks otherworldly even before you dig into it, with its mottled surface of grey, blue and white molds—but cut into the paste, and you`ll find striking jagged veins of mold hiding within. Jersey Blue is a great example of an externally rinded blue, a newer style being pioneered by just a select few creative makers. Swiss cheesemaker Willi Schmid has owned his dairy since 2006. Every morning, before making any one of his two-dozen cheeses, he tastes the milk to determine which one it will be best for. Schmid is passionate about using only raw milk, which he collects personally from local dairy farmers. He also allows his cheeses to age in his cellar until he determines they are ready to send out to affineurs and vendors, such as master fromager Rolf Beeler. The results of his uncompromising dedication to quality are some of the best cheeses in Switzerland.  Jersey Blue is a raw Jersey cow’s milk blue cheese in the shape of a dome. The blue veining is product of hand ladling curds into a mold, creating pockets where the two types of blue mold used by Willi Schmid develops. The cheese is then aged roughly 10 weeks, or until the blue mold has developed throughout the paste and coated the rind. As Schmid says: “I wait for the cheese, not the cheese for me.”Aging Jersey Blue in a cellar imbues it with a slightly musty aroma, contrasted by a clean and tangy scent scent once cut. The Jersey milk provides a rich, buttery backdrop to the assertive flavor of the blueing. Much like the color of the veins, which starts a light blue and darkens to green, the blueing flavor is mild at first but strengthens for a long lasting finish.  We recommend eating it either fresh or aged. The freshness emphasizes the buttery quality of the Jersey milk, while allowing it to age a little longer will dry it out but sharpen the flavors.Jersey Blue is best paired with white wines such as Gewurztraminer and riesling. For a red wine, try Brunello, or a dessert wine such as Vin Santo. Eat it with Birnbrot, a pear bread from the same region of Switzerland. We also recommend this cheese for cooking, because it melts like cream."

This region is referred to as “the Highland of Zurich” in Switzerland. Schafkaeserei Koster (which translates as “Sheep Milk Dairy Koster”) is owned by Franz Koster and his family who established the dairy in 1990. At first, they only worked with sheep’s milk. Then, when government restrictions were lifted and Jersey cows were allowed into Switzerland, the Kosters, being passionate devotees of the breed, were the first to buy a herd.  Realizing that they couldn’t consume all the milk the herd was producing and that it would be wasteful to just sell it to the local co-op which would just blend it with other milks, the Kosters decided to use it for cheesemaking. The Koster dairy is still very much a family business, operated by Franz and his wife together with their grown-up daughters. Today, in addition to making cheese from the milk of their own Jersey cows, the business also purchases Jersey milk from another herd. The Kosters continue to buy sheep’s milk, sourced from seven different flocks. The Jersey Camembert was the first cow’s milk cheese that Franz Koster produced. He developed the recipe while experimenting with the milkand quickly realized that its rich, buttery characteristics made it ideal for a Camembert style cheese. Production of the Jersey Camembert takes place over 24 hours. Starter cultures are added to pasteurized milk while it is heated and, after the newly formed wheels are removed from their forms, they are given an hour-long brine bath. The next step sees the cheeses transferred to a cool ripening room for a period of about ten days and during this time, the white fluffy penicilium candidum mold beging to grow on the outside of the cheese, forming its rind. The cheeses are wrapped in paper when they are still relatively young and firm. About one week after being wrapped, the interior texture begins to soften around the edge, becoming completely soft throughout after 22-25 days. Flavors of the Jersey Camembert are extraordinarily complex with deep, rich notes of cream, butter, mushrooms and earth. The interior texture is a golden, butter color - a result of the carotine-rich Jersey milk - with a meltingly soft and yielding paste.Ideal pairings for this cheese include Champagne or a dry, sparkling white wine or a Sauvignon Blanc."
Jersey Jack,Spring Hill Jersey Cheese,United States,California,,8 lbs,www.springhillcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Vegetable,None,,Smoked,"Located just west of Petaluma in Sonoma County, California, Spring Hill Jersey Cheese is a certified organic farmstead dairy. Cheese is produced by owner Larry Peter, whose herd of pasture-grazed Jersey cows provide the high-butterfat milk. The Petaluma Creamery, which was founded in 1913 and purchased by Peter in 1987, produces a range of products including quark, butter, and several cheddar and jack cheeses. The creamery also provides a place for neighboring farmers to process their milk into value-added products. Production of cheese at Spring Hill begins with the production of feed for the farm’s cows, which is grown on-site. The forage silage mix includes red and white oats, bell beans, rye grass and fava beans, which enable the cows to have a nutritious diet during the winter months when they aren’t grazing outside. Cows are milked twice daily, and milk is delivered directly to Petaluma Creamery, where it is pasteurized. Starter cultures are added as well as vegetarian rennet, and the curd is cut. The whey is removed and sent to the dairy for the cows to drink, or is made into other by-products. The curd then forms a mass, which is placed in a trough, eventually cut into blocks with a knife and turned as they continue to drain. After draining the cheese is put through a curd mill, which cuts the cheese into small pieces, allowing cheesemakers to then incorporate salt, herbs and seasonings. Mixtures are tied in cheesecloth and formed into 8-pound wheels. After 12 hours of pressing the wheels are vacuum-sealed and refrigerated for aging, a minimum of 30 days.Spring Hill’s OrganicJerseyJack comes in both regular and smoked versions. The non-smoked version has a mild, creamy flavor. The smoked version is approachable with a subtle, savory flavor that lingers, reminiscent of campfires and beef jerky, and perfect for topping a hamburger.Pair the regular version with a zinfandel. The smoked version would go well with a strong dark beer."

This domestic twist on the Mediterranean classic hails from Indiana, on the farm of one of America`s most iconic lady goat cheese makers. Judy Schad has been making cheese since 1976, when she and her family moved from the suburbs to a hill farm in southern Indiana. After running the title and discovering the farm had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great, great grandfather in the 1870s, the new land felt like home.  In 1988, after several years of acquiring goats and making goat cheeses for family and friends, the familyopened a commercial dairy. By 2012, after 36 years of breeding and milking at Capriole, they decided to sell their herd. With so many goats and limited space the family wanted to focus exclusively on cheesemaking. Now their milk is produced by Tuckhill Farm, and Schad produces many different goat`s milk cheeses across a wide spectrum of styles. The cheese is named after Hungarian intern, Julianna Sedli, who took an experimental variation of an Old Kentucky Tomme and turned it into something new. During production the milk is coagulated and the curd is cut, cooked, washed (to reduce some of the acidity), and then carefully ladled into large molds. Cheeses are flipped (but are not pressed) over several hours. Afterwards, the young Juliannas are unmolded and placed in a brine solution for about eight hours, then removed to a drying area for two days before being placed in the aging room. The cheeses develop a surface of white, flossy Penicilium candidum mold. Once the surface mold is developed, the herbs are applied, wrapped in paper, and stored in boxes to finish aging.Flavors are buttery, smooth and nutty with a mushroomy-tasting natural rind of herbs, similar to Brin d`Amour. The overtones of the herbs are an integral part of this cheese, and definitely add another dimension and layer of flavor.Rosés and Gruner Vetliners pair well with Julianna, as do Virtue Cider`s Maple Mitten and Percheron. Serve with pickled watermelon or rhubarb, and olives."

Today the company, now headed by Hans’ son John, has grown to become one of the largest Swiss cheese manufacturers in the U.S. The dairy is located in the rolling hills of Geauga County about 35 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio, in one of the largest Amish settlements in the United States. The 100% Grade A milk used in cheesemaking is processed in enclosed equipment to ensure safety throughout the process, and visitors to the facility can explore an on-site Cheese House museum and a Cheese Chalet shop. Jungfrau, also known as Baby-Eyed Swiss, is named after one of the tallest mountains in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. Blocks of the cheese are sealed in plastic before being aged at least two months, during which little holes develop throughout the paste as Proprionibacterium create bubbles filled with CO2. An egg-white paste punctuated with eyes yields a soft, pliable texture.

The berries used for the production of Juni are harvested locally from the mountains. The cheese is made in in the Toma Brusca style, meaning that for production, fresh milk is left to rest for several hours to acidify slowly and naturally. This forms the curd to which the berries are added just prior to the mix being ladled into molds. After unmolding, the cheeses are transferred to a maturing room where they remain for at least two months before release. The format of Juni is that of a small cylinder, weighing approximately 2lbs.

Parish Hill’s cheeses are inspired by the traditional cheeses of Italy. They’re handmade in small batches using raw milk, which is produced at the Elm Lea Farm at the Putney School. The farm is just five minutes down the road from the cheese house, and its milking herd grazes on fresh pasture from June to October. Parish Hill cheese production happens from May to November in order to take advantage of the pastures that give a highly aromatic quality to the milk, resulting in complex and subtle flavor variations.= Milk for cheesemaking is ripened using homegrown cheese cultures, which are produced by inoculating the farm’s raw milk with pure bacterial strains and then propagating them continuously. Traditional calf rennet is sourced from Europe and Quebec, and sea salt is sourced from the Maine Sea Salt Company in Marshfield. Kashar is a Balkan-style pasta filata cheese inspired by basket cheeses of Turkey and Southeast Europe. It’s produced using the same curd that is made into Suffolk Punch, but instead of being hung to age, the curd is turned out into basket molds to form drums. During at least two months of aging, wheels are rubbed with olive oil and polished to create an edible rind.Firm and smooth when young, Kashar becomes increasingly flaky and drier with age. Flavor is buttery and tangy, with notes of pepper becoming more pronounced throughout the affinage period.Pair Kashar with a Sauvignon Blanc or a Beaujolais when young, or with an Amarone or Nebbiolo once it is aged."

With careers as professors within the Wisconsin and Illinois university systems, (Wes as head of Agricultural Science, and Leslie with a strong background in soil science and management) both bring a great deal of experience to farming life. Wes generally takes care of the goats and does the milking, while Leslie oversees the cheesemaking, with help from Alisa, who is Assistant Cheesemaker. The herd of Nubian and La Mancha milking goats currently numbers about 60 within a closed herd system. The milk is of extremely good quality and yields exceptionally high solids. Leslie produces several different varieties of cheese, ranging from a fresh chèvre through to a raw milk blue. Most of her sales take place at Farmers` Markets or go to select retail stores, where invariably demand exceeds supply. A recent development is that Prairie Fruits Farm is buying a limited quantity of sheep`s milk from a local Amish dairy farmer. Leslie has therefoer started making several sheep`s milk cheeses that compliment the existing range of goat`s milk cheese. Made from raw sheeps milk, one of Lesie’s newer creations is Kaskaskia, a cheese loosely style after Manchego, that gets its name from a river that runs through Arthur, Illinois, close to the Amish sheep dairy. For production, after the milk has coagulated the curd is re-heated to a fairly high temperature to expel as much moisture as possible. The curd is drained and then pressed in cheesecloth for several hours. After pressing, the young wheels are transferred to an aging room where they are matured for approximately six months before realease. Kaskaskia has a hard texture which is slightly crumbly and crystalline. The exterior is smooth and slightly waxy. Both the rind and interior paste are a golden beige brown color . Flavors are of walnuts, almond butter and caramel with a pleasant note of salt."

The tangy cheese is balanced by an earthy flavor from the addition ofvegetable ash.Keep Dreaming has an overall mild flavor, with a paste that coats the tongue. It smells and tastes of stone, but also carries hints of lavender and salt.Best served smeared on some crusty bread with fig jam and washed down with a wheat beer."
Kenne,Tomales Farmstead Creamery,United States,California,3 in x 3 in x 1.5 in,6 oz,www.tolumafarms.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Geotricum,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),," As soon as you pull this mold-ripened goat’s milk square out of the fridge, its undulating surface starts to grow super-soft and supple; when cut open, that thick creamline will start oozing out. That softness—combined with its captivating wrinkly rind—renders the diminutive cube undeniably photogenic. It all starts in Marin County, California, on Toluma Farms—a propery of rolling green hills that David Jablons and Tamara Hicks purchased in 2003. The duo began sheep dairying four years later, and with some help from local grants and organizations built Tomales Farmstead Creamery in 2012. Kenne was released as the creamery’s first cheese.Today the repertoire includes goat, sheep, and mixed-milk cheeses, made using farmstead milk from Toluma’s 100 East Friesian sheep and 200 goats. Creamy Jersey cow’s milk is also sometimes used, sourced from a neighbor’s farm two miles down the road. David and Tamara traveled several times to Italy to witness production of their favorite cheeses, and were particularly inspired byLa Tur. Tomales Farmstead Creamery cheesemaker Anne Marie, who had worked at various farmstead creameries in France, was also inspired by the cheeses she made there. Kenne is a blend of these ideas. The secret toitswrinkly beauty lies in a particular yeast called Geotrichum candidum, which Tomales’ cheesemakers add to fresh goat milk before transforming it into curds and then cheese. After five to seven days of aging, the yeast’s action begins to produce the unique exterior surface of freshly-molded cheeses, and after an additional week at around 50 degrees Fahrenheit the squares are ready for sale.Aromas of hard cider and fresh dough seep from this cream-colored cheese. The fondantlike paste surrounded by a fat, oozing creamline becomes fluffy and mouth-coating on the palate, yielding flavors of fermentation, salted pretzel and rye.Pair this with figs: fig jam, dried figs, or a fig-forward wine."

Originally from New Zealand, both Jean and Linnea were raised on farms. They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into a property in Maine that has belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Kennebec Highlands Caerphilly is an alpine-style cheese made from goat’s milk. To produce the cheese, the Koons heat treat the milk, cool it down to 86 degrees, add cultures and rennet and let the milk inoculate for 1-1.5 hours. After cutting and stirring the curds, the mixture is reheated to 90 degrees, the whey is poured off and the curds are formed into molds. The freshly formed wheels are flipped and pressed overnight, then soaked in brine for several hours before being coated with cream wax and aged for 4-6 months.Aromas of fresh cream, cave and grass upfront give way to a very buttery, salty and well-rounded flavor on the palate. Paste is semi-firm and chewy with some small air pockets.Pair it with a Côtes du Rhône or a white Burgundy. For beer pairings, try a lager or a hefeweizen, such as Rising Tide’s Spinnaker."

Goat`s Leap has built a deserved reputation for very high quality cheese from their small production and their herd of LaMancha goats. Over the years, they have developed excellent dairy and milking genetics in the herd, which have greatly helped other American LaMancha dairies improve their stock. Goat`s Leap is a seasonal dairy. Cheesemaking normally commences in April and lasts until late October or early November. The cheeses that Barbara makes also reflect the seasons. Every day, weather permitting, the goats are taken out onto the hillside above the house to browse the native California shrubs and bushes. Barbara makes a variety of predominently younger, mold ripened cheeses in the tiny cheese room, just up the hill from the house. What sets Barbara`s cheeses apart is not just the flavor but their texture. Starting with very high quality milk, Barbara handles the curd for her cheeses with great dexterity that results in some of the finest, silkiest textures of any American cheeses on the market. Named after one of Barbara`s goats, Kiku is resolutely seasonal, appearing only during the summer when the fig tree behind Barbara`s house is in full leaf. Kiku is doused in Sauvignon Blanc and wrapped in a fig leaf that encases the delicate, silky-textured cheese. The leaf imparts a wonderful hint of coconut to the cheese, accompanied by clean, lactic and citrus flavors."
Kinderhook Creek,Old Chatham Sheepherding Company,United States,New York,"4.5 ins diameter, 2-3 ins high",14 oz,www.blacksheepcheese.com,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,,,"Located in the upper reaches of the Hudson River Valley, Old Chatham Sheepherding Company was founded in 1993 by Tom and Nancy Clark, with 150 East Friesian ewes. It could be said that it was destined to happen, since at aged 10, Tom won a blue ribbon at the Dutchess County Fair for his Hampshire Sheep. At the time he pronounced to a local newspaper reporter that he wanted to raise a flock when he grew up. After life took his career in a different direction for a number of years, the Clarks did, in fact, end up raising that flock when they built Old Chatham Sheepherding Company. The couple has been involved in every aspect of the company, from the design of the barns to cheesemaking to working to maintain the property. Old Chatham not only produce cheeses, but also sheep’s milk yogurt. In fact, in 2007, the yogurt was in such demand that the milk supply on the property was strained. Consequently, they began a program working with a number of Amish farmers in their area to buy their milk as well as helping to increase the farmers’ sheep milk production. This ensured the Old Chatham was able to continue to maximise production of their cheeses and yogurts. Old Chatham’s own flock now numbers over 800 ewes comprised of East Friesian, Dorset Finn and various crosses and as such, constitutes the largest sheep dairy in the United States. Kinderhook Creek is a product of the partnership with Amish farmers. It was released in 2011 and is very similar to Old Chatham’s Shepherd’s Wheel.Aged for only two-weeks before release, the cheese has a very thin bloomy rind. Under the rind is a firm and dense paste with a very mild flavor with a hint of mushrooms.  If matured further, up to 8 weeks, it will ripen from the outside in, becoming supple and spreadable. Kinderhook Creek will also increasingly have the aroma of mushrooms and nuts. The flavor transforms from very mild to savory, to the point of being almost meaty.Pair this cheese with a very dry sparkling wine in order to have nice contrast in texture and flavor. When served on warm bread and drizzled with honey Kinderhook Creek truly shines. It can also be served with mushrooms and flat bread, or in a grilled cheese sandwich using pumpernickel bread."

Starting the creamery allowed the Erbs to preserve a family farm that had been called Springvale Farms, which they’d been running since 1980. The Erbs spent their first decade at Springvale farms purchasing the cows, equipment and land from Doug’s parents. By the time they changed the name in 2008, they had had also renovated an old veterinary clinic owned by Doug’s father, which they’d converted into a modern creamery. While Landaff Creamery’s first cheese, Landaff, was created to be approachable and versatile, their second cheese, this Saint Nectaire-inspired tomme, is decidedly funkier. Once the wheels of raw milk cheese are produced at the creamery, they`re transferred to the aging caves at the Cellars at Jasper Hill in the rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont. Jasper Hill ages the cheese at the proper temperature and humidity levels for three to five months. Initially wheels are washed with brine, however over time a natural rind is allowed to develop as the paste evolves from firm to creamy. The cheese has a complex flavor that includes butter, pungent earthy forest, and mushrooms, plus hints of roasted artichoke and asparagus.Pair Kinsman Ridge with a sauvignon blanc, a wheat beer or a dried saucisson."

Nettle Meadow’s origins date back to 1993, when Raynald Hebert and his wife Laurie Goodheart transformed an old farmstead into a small cheesemaking facility and enough acreage to support approximately thirty goats. Its name was a reflection of the wild nettles and herbs that made up the goats’ diet. Twelve years after its founding, the farm was sold to Sheila and Lorraine, both of whom had been living in California and were seeking a complete change of direction. Since 2005 they have worked extensively to expand the operation. Now spanning 75 acres, it is home to over 360 Alpine, Nubian, Saanen and mixed breed goats, several dozen East Freisian sheep and a variety of other farm animals currently cared for by the farm’s sanctuary. In 2017, estimated cheese production will be about 150,000 pounds of cheese. Sheila and Lorraine are passionate supporters of the farming lifestyle, the human care of animals and artisan cheese and run the farm with the assistance of Shiela’s mother Joan together with eighteen employees. One of Nettle Meadow’s best known cheeses, Kunik is a triple cream cheese made from a blend of pasteurized Jersey cow`s cream and goat`s milk. Available in two sizes, larger wheels weigh between 12-15oz while the small rounds (also known as Kunik Buttons) range from 6-12oz. Cheeses are aged for between three to four weeks before release.The blend of milks results in a particularly rich array of rich, lactic flavors. Earthy, mushroom notes are balanced by a buttery roundness that leaves a delicious coating in the mouth. The texture is close, dense and yet meltingly smooth.Try a slice of Kunik layered onto a gingersnap cookie. Its mellow, lemony creaminess offers a lovely counterpoint to the cookie`s spicy snap, while its paste melds the pair into a luxurious bite.

Its origins date back to the 1970’s, when founder Mary Keehn became interested in goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. After starting with two animals, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the herd increased significantly; finding herself with excess milk, Keehn began experimenting with cheesemaking, founding Cypress Grove in 1983. Keehn was a pioneer. At that time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US. As the company grew, Keehn decided to sell her animals to a number of local farms and buy back the milk. Today, each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring consistent high quality. As the company expanded, Keehn was approached with many acquisition offers. However none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keeping the company headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. In addition to the younger style goat’s milk cheeses made in the Arcata creamery, in 1998 Keehn introduced a new range of matured cheeses to complement and “round out” the Cypress Grove line. These aged gouda-style cheeses are produced in the Netherlands and sold under the Cypress Grove label. Not only does this relationship help Cypress Grove avoid risking cross contamination (associated with making different kinds of cheeses), but it also addresses the issue of the considerable amount of additional space needed for aging these types of cheeses. Released in 2003, Lamb Chopper is made from pasteurized sheep’s milk unlike the other goat cheeses from Cypress Grove.Aged for at least three months, the interior texture of Lamb Chopper is ivory white in color with a smooth firm paste. Flavors of butter and cream are balanced with a gentle acidity resulting in a mild and yet full flavored, accessible cheese.Although Lamb Chopper pairs well with either red or white wines, try to avoid anything too tannic or oaky."

Mrs Kirkham's Lancashire,Lower Beesley Farm,United Kingdom,Lancashire,Various,"40, 25, or 6.5 lbs",www.mrskirkhams.com,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Cloth Wrapped,Cheddar-like,,"At Lower Beesley Farm near Goosnargh Village in the county of Lancashire, England, the Kirhkam family is making the world`s last authentic raw-milk Lancashire cheese. Residents of the property for over 70 years, the Kirhkams have made cheese here for three generations. It all started with Ruth, Mrs. Kirkham herself, in 1978. Eventually she handed the cheesemaking operation over to her son Graham, who runs the business today alongside his partner Kellie, their two sons, and a small staff. Milk is sourced from the farm`s own herd of Holstein Friesian cows. Production of Lancashire is quite a unique process. Each morning raw, cooled milk from the previous evening`s milking is added to warm, morning milk. Starter culture and rennet are added before the curd is cut by hand and allowed to settle, thereby retaining as much fat as possible within the curd. After the whey is drained off, the curd is transferred to another container where it is broken up. In keeping with traditional Lancashire production, Graham then mixes curd from the previous day`s production in equal quantities with the curd from the current batch. The curds are milled, salted, molded and pressed; the exterior cloth or bandage applied between multiple pressings. Cheeses are then coated with a liberal layer of butter and allowed to mature. The Kirkhams like to mature the cheese for at least six weeks before it leaves the farm. This produces a wheel that is mild, creamy, and slightly crumbly. Cheeses are made in three different sizes, the smallest of which (at 6.5 pounds) is reserved for the Christmas market, while the midi and large wheels (25 and 40 pounds, respectively) are sold year-round. Larger wheels continue to mature for up to 12 months, at which point flavors are at their fullest and most rounded. Midi size wheels are usually sold at after three months.The texture of Lancashire is moist, rich, crumbly and creamy - in fact locals refer to it as ""buttery crumble,"" while Graham Kirkham calls it ""fluffy monster."" Flavors are buttery, lemony and yogurty, with a pronounced tang and a long, rounded finish.Pair Lancashire with cake—seriously! In its hometown, the wheel is traditionally eaten alongside eccles cake, a flaky currant-studded pastry, or the less-sweet chorley cake."
Landaff,Landaff Creamery,United States,New Hampshire,"10 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",9-10 lbs,www.landaffcreamery.com/,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Landaff Creamery, located in Landaff, NH, was established in 2008 by Doug and Debby Erb, allowing them to preserve their family farm that had been begun by Doug’s parents in the 1950’s. The Erbs moved back to the family farm, called Springvale Farms, in 1980 and, over the course of the next decade, the Erbs purchased the cows, equipment and land from Doug’s parents. By the time they changed the name to Landaff Creamery in 2008, the Erbs had also renovated an old veterinary clinic owned by Doug’s father and converted it into a modern creamery. The creamery and the cheese get their name from the town of Landaff, which in turn was named after a Welsh bishop who was chaplain of King George III of England. In honor of this link to history, the Erbs created a Welsh style farmstead cheese inspired by a traditional Caerphilly cheese recipe, learned from Chris Duckett. Chris Duckett, a 3rd generation cheesemaker in Somerset, England had kept alive the tradition of Welsh farmstead cheeses, producign a matured Caerphilly cheese for many decades. The result was, aptly named Landaff. Once the wheels are produced at the Creamery, they are transferred for aging in caves at the Cellars at Jasper Hill in Greensborough, Vermont. Jasper Hill ages the cheese at the proper temperature and humidity levels for four months. Once the cheese is aged, Jasper Hill packages and sells the cheese.Each wheel is handmade and is reflective of the season in which it is produced. Inside Landaff’s rustic rind is a semi-firm paste with a rich mouthfeel.  Balanced flavors of tangy buttermilk and savory-sweet brown butter contrast with aromas of grass and cave. Used as both a table cheese and a good cooking cheese, Landaff is great to use in Fondue as a refreshing change from Raclette.Pairing suggestions for Landaff include: dry to off dry apple cider; a variety of beers including Pilsners, IPAs, Saisons and medium Ales; and white wines with good minerality such as those from the Loire Valley."

Granted AOC (now PDO) status in 1975, Langres is produced in several sizes. Although most producers use pasteurized milk for production, two cheesemakers still make a raw milk cheese: La Ferme du Modia, which is farmhouse production, and the creamery of Schertenlieb. The best season for Langres is usually summer through autumn, when the milk is at its best. After production cheeses are matured in cellar conditions for a period of between four and five weeks, during which time they develop much of their unique character. The rind of each wheel receives a coating of annatto (a natural red dye derived from the seed of the South American annatto shrub) that turns it a golden-orange color. They are also washed regularly with brine and Marc de Champagne to encourage the growth of the molds on the rind that mature the cheese. The cheese is known for itsdistinctive depression, or ""well"" in its uppermost surface, which is known as a ""fontaine.""Langres has a pronounced ""stinky"" aroma that is almost invariably stronger than the flavor of the cheese. Its rind is a golden yellow color and distinctively wrinkled in appearance. it can also be slightly sticky.The interior paste is creamy-white in color, with a dense, smooth and slightly moist texture. Flavors are smooth, slightly salty and milky with a lactic tang.It is traditional to pour a small quantity of marc, Champagne or brandy into the fontaineto accompany the cheese; for a real show-stopper, try lighting it on fire."
Lavendar Honey with Chili Burrata,Fiore di Nonno,United States,Massachusetts,,4.75 ounces,www.fioredinonno.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),Flavor added to paste,"Lourdes Smith comes from a long line of Italian cheesemakers; her great-grandfather Alphonso Fiore made cheese in Italy and then in Hoboken, New Jersey after immigrating to the US. She was inspired early on by watching her grandfather Joe, who had taken over Alphonso’s shop, making mozzarella, ricotta and basket cheese. Her business in Somerville, Massachusetts, whose name translates into “my grandfather’s flower,” is a salute to him. Lourdes sources mozzarella curd from partner farms. She recently worked with Shy Brothers Farm in Westport, MA, which is run by two sets of fraternal twins, to develop a curd recipe using their antibiotic and hormone-free cow’s milk. Shy Brothers’ cows graze on pasture in a peninsula that juts out into the Westport River. After Lourdes receives the curd, she transforms it by hand each morning in her Somerville, MA kitchen. The cheesemaking process begins by breaking the curd into even pieces using a tool called a guitar. Lourdes then adds hot water to the curd, which slowly brings it up to melting temperature so that it can be stretched using a wooden paddle, then shaped.The resulting mozzarella is moist and refreshing, soft in texture, milky and buttery with a hint of salt. Burrata originated in the Murgia area of Italy. It’s a disk of fresh mozzarella that is shaped into a pouch, inside of which is stuffed stracciatella (a mix of fresh cream, salt and curds that have been pulled into strings). Fiore di Nonno Burrata is made in several unique combinations that play with sweetness, savory and tangy flavors. To make Lavender Honey with Chili Burrata, Lourdes fills her traditional mozzarella with Italian mascarpone, a dab of Greek yogurt and honey that has been infused with lavender petals and hot chili flakes."
Lavort,Fromagerie de Terre Dieu,France,Auvergne,"6.5 ins diameter, 4.5 ins high",4.5 lbs,www.caseus-lavort.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Re-created in 1989 by French cheese maker Patrick Beaumont with the help of the renowned chef Pierre Troisgrois, Lavort is produced by the Fromagerie de Terre Dieu in the Auvergne region of France. Legend has it that the cheese was originally crafted by a young peasant called Guillaume as a tribute to his mentor, Baron Lavort, who was killed during the Spanish Crusades. In the course of his Crusading adventures, Guillaume was taught the art of cheesemaking by the Monks of Compostella in Spain, and the sunken-topped cheese that they made at the abbey reminded Guillaume of the great volcanoes and mountains of his native Auvergne. Upon his return, Guillaume started making the cheese from the milk of his flock of Lacaune sheep. Today, this raw milk cheese is still made with the milk of Lacaune sheep, a breed that is native to the Massif Central region. Between April and November the sheep are on pasture, and during the winter are fed meadow hay and suppliments of cerials and vegetable proteins. They are never fed silage. The shepherds are paid according to the quality of the milk, thus encouraging a high standard. For production, the milk is gently heated to the same temperature as the bosy heat of the ewes. This helps to preserve the integrity and flavors of the milk. After coagulation and draining, the curd is cut into blocks and each block placed into a mold lined with cheese cloth. Cheeses are turned (flipped) several times to ensure even moisture distribution and drainage before being unmolded and placed in a brine (salt water) solution for 24 hours. This helps to promote the formation of a rind. Finally, the cheeses are transferred to maturing rooms where they are aged on fir wood boards at a temperature below 50?(10?C) and high humidity for between 3-6 months before release. The exterior appearance of Lavort is unique, with each wheel appearing like a flattened boule, with its distinctive “well” on the top and bottom surfaces. The rind is a rich earthy color and rustic in appearance. The interior texture is ivory colored with a fairly open textured paste, dotted with “eyes” or holes. Flavors of Lavort are mild and slightly sweet with distinct notes of hay, earth, smoke and bacon."
Le Brebiou,Bongrain SA,France,Pyrénées-Atlantiques,1.5 in diameter,180g,www.bongrain.com,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,,,"Le Brebiou is a bloomy-rinded sheep’s milk cheese produced by the French cheese company Bongrain.The history of Bongrain dates back to 1920 in Illoud, France, when Jean- Noel Bongrain, then only 19 years of age, inherited the small family business of Fromagerie d’Illoud (as it was then called). By the early 1950’s, Bongrain began to develop the family business in a new direction, seeking to break away from the traditional French cheeses. Jean- Noel‘s vision was to produce a nationally-branded cheese, an idea that was unheard of at the time in France. He wanted to create a recipe that would not only be unique in taste but could be reproduced throughout the various regions of France.The first cheese to be made along these lines was ‘Caprice des Dieux’, first produced in 1950. Having penetrated the French market, Bongrain then launched further afield, and by 1960 was selling cheese in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Today, Bongrain is France’s second largest cheese and dairy producer and 5th largest in the world. The group currently operates production facilities in 24 counties all over the world including Europe, North America, South America, and Asia.Le Brebiou has been produced since 1994, and today is sold in both full-fat and low-fat versions (the low-fat version, called “Brebiou ligne et plaisir”, contains only 10% fat). It’s produced in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques region, and is aged for two weeks. Its rind often shows visible markings from the linen wrappings and bowl-shaped hoops used during production.It’s a mild, creamy, and very rich cheese, with a smooth interior paste that becomes firmer, and a taste that becomes more tart, toward its center. Pair it with a light red, a fruity and dry white, or a rosé. "

Goats were first introduced to the area with the arrival of the Saracens in the eighth century together with their recipes for goat`s cheeses. Fortunately for us, both the goats and the cheese knowledge remained after the invaders were forced to leave.Le Chevrot is produced in both pasteurized and raw milk versions, although it is only the pasteurized cheeses that are available in the United States.Aged for at least two weeks, cheeses have an edible, natural, geotricum rind that gives the Le Chevrot a wrinkled appearance. The interior texture is smooth, dense and quite firm.Cheeses can be sold either young or aged.Younger versions have a milder flavor that is reminiscent of herbs, barnyard, toasted nuts and hay. The texture has a higher moisture content and is quite dense while the color of the interior paste is a bone-white, becoming darker towards the rind.Flavors in older cheeses intensify, while still remaining balanced, and often develop hints of caramel. The flavors of barnyard and goat become stronger while the texture of the cheese becomes drier over time, and the color of the paste darkens.Ultimately, it is not uncommon for these types of cheeses to become suitable for grating."
Le Marechal ,Fromagerie Le Maréchal SA,Switzerland,Vaud,11 in diameter x 4 in height,13 lb,www.le-marechal.ch,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Herbed,,,"Fromagerie Le Maréchal is a family cheesemaking business run by Jean-Michel Rapin and his three sons in the Vaud region of Switzerland.The Rapin family has produced their signature “Le Maréchal“ cheese since 1992. Jean-Michel was originally inspired to make a Swiss original that stood apart from Gruyère. He decided to produce a high-quality firm cheese, and to dress the rind with a mix of aromatic, organic herbs. He named this cheese (and his business) after his great-grandfather Emile, a blacksmith (‘maréchal-ferrant"" in French), who he describes as an “authentic, conscientious craftsmen.” A sketch of Emile Rapin’s moustached face thus became the mark of the Le Maréchal brand, and now adorns the packaging on each piece of cheese.Milk from 14 producers is delivered to the facility twice a day, each day of the year. Jean-Michel and his sons transform it into cheese no later than ten hours after milking. The curd is pressed into wheels, brined and then refined with a special mix of aromatic herbs, which are rubbed by hand over the cheese’s surface throughout its 120-day ripening period.Le Maréchal’s beige paste has a distinctive aroma of butter, dried fruits, and a touch of barnyard. Its flavor is intense and lingering, with notes of salted caramel, roasted almonds and herbs. The herbs are more evident toward the rind, which is edible; instead of removing it, scrape it gently with a knife before consuming.Pair it with figs or olives and a Chasselas white wine.

Le Petit Dejuner,Marin French Cheeese Co.,,California,"2 ins diameter, 2 ins high",4 oz, www.marinfrenchcheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Fresh,,,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the Marin French Cheese Company was founded in1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Marin French, also known as Rouge et Noir, is the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States.Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. Marin French specializes in the production of young and soft ripened cheeses.For production, fresh milk is pasteurized and poured into several hundred individual 20 gallon `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then about 45 minutes later, the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.)With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. By the time the curd from each bucket has been put into the molds, the first cheeses are ready to be flipped for the first time. This manoever allows for the even distribution of moisture and drainage. The cheeses are turned again 2 hours later and then left to drain overnight.After 14 hours the cheeses are unmolded and transferred to the brining room where they are brined for between 30-120 minutes. They are then placed on racks to dry for between 12-24 hours.Le Petit Dejuner is released at a very young age - 72 hours. As such, it is classified as a fresh cheese.The texture of the Dejuner is open, curdy, meaning it is firm with a slightly dense and slightly clay-like mouthfeel. The color of the paste is ivory white.Flavors are of salt and cream, with a slight citrus tang."
Le Sousbois,Le Sapalet,Switzerland,Vaud,"2.5 in diameter, 1 in height",5 oz,www.sapalet.com/drupal,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to rind,"In a country where the dairy cow has been erected as a national symbol, Jean-Robert Henchoz’s decision to build himself a herd of 700 dairy sheep, the largest in Switzerland, was unprecedented. After spending a decade making cow’s milk cheeses in the high mountains of the Vaud region, Henchoz decided to specialize in sheep, starting his own organic sheep farm in 2000. From that time, he has increased his range of yogurt and cheese products by one each year, working alongside his son, his son’s wife and his grandchildren. While Le Sapalet products are primarily produced using sheep and goat’s milks, this cheese is produced using cow’s milk purchased from a neighbour. The organic milk comes from a flock of twenty purebread Simmental cows, a rustic breed with horns. The cows graze up in the high mountains during summer and feed on local hay in winter.Le Sousbois has a very thin bloomy rind and an buttery, gooey yellow paste. Discs are aged while wrapped in spruce bark, which imparts its woodsy, smoky flavors into the cheese, especially into the outer edges. The name is appropriate; separated into two words, sous bois would literally translate into ‘under wood,’ while le sousbois itself means ‘undergrowth.’ The cheese is fittingly earthy and mushroomy, with aromas reminiscent of wet grass. Spruce coating and a pronounced lack of salt bring its intense earthy qualities a step further.Pair Le Sousbois with a crisp and slightly hoppy summer ale, a Champagne or a Bordeaux. "
L’Édel de Cléron,Fromagerie Jean Perrin,France,Franche-Comte,"3 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",12oz,www.jean-perrin.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced by Fromagerie Jean Perrin, L’Édel de Cléron is a a soft-ripened cheese made from pasteurized cow’s milk and encircled with a strip of spruce bark. The cheese is named after the town of Cléron, located in Franche-Comte region of the Jura mountains in south-eastern France. This is also the town where Jean Perrin and his wife Madeleine, both of whom were brought up in the area and come from cheesemaking families, established their own business in 1965. The business is still family owned and operated. L’Édel de Cléron takes its inspiration from another Jura cheese with traditional origins, Vacherin Mont D’Or. While L’Édel de Cléron is made from pasteurized milk and is therefore relatively mild in flavor, Vacherin Mont D`Or is made with raw milk. However, the two cheeses bear several similarities in terms of each having a yielding texture; Vacherin can beome positively molten with age,and the fact that they are both encircled with spruce bark which lends a definite woodsy, pine-like aroma to the cheeses. Milk for production of L’Édel de Cléron is sourced from Montbeliarde cows on Jura mountain plateaus. The cows are fed exclusively on grass and fodder produced on the farm where they live. The farms all operate sustainably with emphasis on animal health and well being, and the dairies collaborate closely with Perrin to produce milk of the highest cheesemaking quality. This relationship provides economic stability for the farmers, with milk prices that are both consistent and higher than the national average,all of which helps to compensate for the added costs associated with producing higher quality milk and difficult climatic conditions. During production, the curd is cut into approximately one-inch cubes and gently hand-ladled into forms, where the curd is allowed to drain under its own weigh with no pressing. This allows for the preservation of moisture, a critical factor in determining the texture of the matured cheese. After draining, the young cheeses are unmolded and a strip of spruce bark is placed around the circumference. This tradition is very particular to the Jura mountains and has been taking place for centuries. The collection of spruce bark takes place during the summer months when it is taken from felled trees in long strips, each one measuring about one inch wide. It is then stored until needed, at which point the strips are boiled to sterlize and soften them before being cut into the appropriate length for the cheese. As well as adding flavor to the cheese, the addition of spruce bark also helps to hold the cheese together as it becomes softer with age.During the cheeses’ two week maturation, the rind will become covered in a soft, bloomy white mold, helping to break down and soften the texture. Simultaneously, flavors from the spruce bark permeate the cheese giving it aromas of wood with distinct notes of mushrooms and earth. Flavors are extremely rich, tasting of cream with echoes of truffle.Pairings for L’Édel de Cléron include Pinot Noir until the cheese becomes very ripe when an Alsatian Riesling or Pinot Gris would be a better match."
Legato,Andante Dairy,United States,California,"5 ins diameter, 1 in high",9 oz,www.andantedairy.com,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,,,"Established in 1999, Andante Dairy is owned and operated by Soyoung Scanlan. The creamery is located at the Volpi Ranch near Petaluma, just north of San Francisco, California, which is also the source for Scanlan`s goat`s milk. Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three. Made in the style of a traditional Camembert, Legato is a soft pasteurized cow’s milk cheese. During its production, the curds are hand ladled into the molds to ensure that the cheese forms gently. Once set, each cheese is turned a number of times before being salted and aged for at least three weeks before release.The result is a cheese with an unctuous paste and highly developed flavor. As a scientist, Soyoung is constantly improving her technique with Legato, so expect it to evolve as time goes on.With a full flavor, this cheese is best paired with light red wines, dry Rosé wines, and Lager or Saison beers. It also can be paired nicely with Brut Sparkling wines. Serve Legato with grapes, or melon and good bread for the best contrast of flavor and texture."
Leonora,,Spain,Leon,,3.5 lbs,,Goat,,Firm,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Produced in the mountainous region of Leon in northwestern Spain, Leonora is a relatively new creation, and is very much a part of a resurgence in Spanish cheesemaking that has been taking place in recent years.Made from the pasteurized milk of Alpine goats, Leonora is produced in a striking loaf shape. Cheeses have a natural, mold ripened rind that is occasionally mottled with gray.The interior paste is bone-white and the texture is very smooth and dense. As the cheeses age, the paste begins to break down just under the rind, becoming more runny and slightly translucent. Leonora should never be completely soft and runny all the way through. In fact, a cheese where the soft layer extends more than an inch into the center of the cheese is probably past its best.In young cheeses, flavors are balanced, bright, creamy and lactic, with a pleasant, lemony tang. With age, these intensify and can become quite assertive, especially just under the rind."
Les Frères,Crave Brothers Farmstead Classics,United States,Wisconsin,"7.5 ins diameter, 2 ins high",2lb, www.cravecheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Washed,,,"Located in Waterloo, Wisconsin, Crave Brothers is a family owned farm and cheesemaking business, operated by four brothers: Charles, Thomas, Mark and George.The siblings, who all grew up on their family’s 40 cow dairy in Wisconsin have arranged the division of labor so that each brother has an area of responsibility best suited to their interests and skills. Tom manages the crops and equipment upkeep, Mark is responsible for milking operations, George oversees and manages cheesemaking and Charles oversees bookeeping.Having originally rented a farm just west of Madison in the early 1980`s, where they milked just under 60 cows, the brothers later purchased 300 acres of farmland in Waterloo, a move which allowed them to farm on a much larger scale, construct a new dairy, and grow their own animal feed.For years they sold fluid milk, until milk prices fell and the brothers needed to think of ways to add value to their milk. In 2001 they decided to go into cheese production.Today, the farm milks 1,100 Holsteins that George proudly describes as “the Cadillac of dairy breeds”. The cheesemaking operation is located across the road from the barns and milking parlor, and milk is pumped directly to the cheese room via a pipe laid under the road.In addition to making cheese, as with many modern cheesemaking operations, the farm is on the edge of environmental stewardship. As such, the Crave Brothers’ facility is carbon negative, a result of utilizing the waste from the cows by channeling it into an computer-controlled anaerobic digester. This produces methane gas that powers an internal combusion engine, in turn generating enough electricity to power the farm, cheesemaking facility and 300 area homes.Crave Brothers produce a variety of fresh and aged cheeses from their three cheesemaking vats. Three vats are designed to each hold 26,000lbs of milk and these are primarily used for production of fresh and part skim mozzarella. A fourth, smaller vat holds 5,000lbs and is used to produce Les Frères and Petit Frère.Literally translating as “The Brothers” in French, production of Les Frères is the most delicate process of the cheeses made at Crave Brothers. Cheeses are hand-ladeled, washed regularly with brine and matured for a minimum of three weeks on site. The construction of a larger ""cave"" underneath the cheesemaking facility has helped improve the maturing process.Reflecting the brothers` French-Irish heritage, Les Frères is a semi-soft, washed rind cheese styled after Reblochon, Muenster and Gubbeen.When young, flavors are milky and clean, with notes of citrus. With age, Les Frères can become quite assertive, with complex flavors best described as fruity, tangy and earthy.Les Frères pairs well with Rieslings and Pinot Gris. For beer drinkers, it is a great match for stouts or Belgian-style ales. It makes a welcome addition to any cheese course or served as part of a mushroom bake with crusty bread."
Leyden,James Ranch Artisan Cheese,United States,Colorado,,,www.jamesranch.net,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,,Gouda-like,Flavor added to paste," A cheesemaking operation is one of several family-run ventures that together comprise Dunrago, Colorado-based James Ranch. It’s led by Dan and Becca James, a couple who met while studying at the University of Washington and then visited cheesemakers in New Zealand and Europe for inspiration before returning to Dan’s childhood home, where they’ve created a 100% grassfed dairy producing milk from Jersey cows. The James’ operation differs from conventional dairies in several ways. Cows are milked seasonally—given a break in the wintertime—and only once per day. They are never fed grain, only diverse grasses from the ranch’s 400 acres of pasture, around which they move three times per day to encourage healthy forage growth. Modeled after a traditional Dutch cheese studded with whole cumin seeds, wheels of Leyden are aged anywhere from six months to a year.Leyden’s craggy, orange paste dotted with seeds is all curry and light cumin on the nose—like walking into a store selling Indian spices.

Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successibe generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay.For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats.Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition.Lil Moo is a fresh Jersey cow’s milk cheese made in the style of Boursin cheese. Lactic fermentation is used to coagulate the milk over a period of many hours or even days.The resulting cheese has a pale yellow color,.  This is as a result of natural carotene present in the grass where the cows are pastured and graze.  Lil Moo’s texture is dense but spreadable, almost like cream cheese. It has a mild, slightly sweet-tart flavor.This is a cheese that can be used in a variety of recipes including spreading on crostini, dolloped on pizzas or blended into sauces.  When served on its own with fresh berries, Lil’ Moo can be paired with light un-oaked white wines such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. It can also be paired with off-dry white wines such as Riesling or sparkling wines such as Moscato. For an interesting pairing, try Lil Moo with a floral IPA."
Lillé Coulommiers,Vermont Farmstead Cheese Company,United States,Vermont,Various,"7 oz, 14 oz, or 3 lb",vermontfarmstead.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),," In 2009, the Vermont Farmstead Cheese Company started as a community effort to preserve a dairy farm in South Woodstock, Vermont and its beautiful 18-acre landscape. The farm, which produced its first cheese in 2011, has since transformed into an award-winning cheese company. In 2012, they added a production facility in Windsor, Vermont alongside a brewery, distillery, sculpture garden, and glass blowing factory.   By merging community collaboration with traditional cheesemaking practices, the farm is creating a new generation of artisanal cheese in its region of Vermont. Committed to farmstead cheese, they use milk from from their herd of 70 dairy cows, a mix of Holsteins, Jersey, Brown Swiss, and Ayrshires.  Lillé Coulommiers was created in the image of the raw milk soft-ripened French Coulommiers. Aged in its own white mold room, Lillé Coulommiers develops a downy white bloomy rind—though with age, it can turn straw-colored and mottled. Its texture is creamy and velvety: When the cheese is young, its paste is supple and firmer at its core, but with age, it softens and becomes more gooey throughout. Lillé Coulommiers is best enjoyed between 40 and 90 days.In the mouth, Lillé Coulommiers is creamy and rich but has a clean finish. The paste is delicate with sweet cream flavor and notes of mushrooms, nuts, and butter. The bloomy rind adds contrast with a touch of salt and a toothsome bite. Flavors become more intense with age.Pair with sparkling white wine and serve with honeycomb, fresh strawberries, fig jam, and toasted pecans."
Lilly Pad,Willapa Hills,United States,Washington,8 in diameter x 7.5 in height,15 lbs,www.willapahillscheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Nestled on the banks of the Chehalis River in southwest Washington, Willapa Hills Farm is a mix of lowland pastures and timbered hills. Amy and Stephen Hueffed first started dreaming of a lifestyle change during an inspiring trip through Northern California, where they sampled local cheeses and pondered one day producing their own. Fourteen years later in 2005, after taking Washington State University cheesemaking classes in Pullman and Skagit Valley, Amy and Stephen finally settled onto their farm with a flock of 60 dairy ewes. Willapia Hills, now home to three generations of the Hueffed family, has continuously revised and expanded its activities and product line. The diverse mix of sheep’s milk, cow’s milk and mixed-milk cheeses is produced with a long-term commitment to sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. For example, the farm has switched over to growing all of its own hay, lowering costs of overall feed and ensuring that hay is natural and free of pesticides and commercial fertilizers. One of Willapa Hills’ newest cheeses, Lilly Pad is an American original inspired by classic European Alpine-style cheeses. Like the early Swiss settlers who logged the old-growth forests and farmed the valleys of Willapa Hills over a century ago, says Stephen Hueffed, the cheese “carries on an old world tradition with a new world outlook.” The barrel-shaped wheels are aged for at least five months.Lily Pad displays a beautiful, firm golden-colored paste surrounded by a brownish rind dotted with mold. Taste is a perfect balance between creamy saltiness and a hint of caramel, brown-butter sweetness. Brothy, umami flavors are concentrated near the rind, and we taste hints of walnuts, potato and Cheez-Its. Aftertaste is smooth and slightly sweet.Pair Lilly Pad with a hard apple cider, and serve it alongside a lighter, non-spiced salami or a meaty prosciutto. It’s also a great sandwich cheese, and it melts beautifully."
Limburger (Country Castle),Chalet Cheese Cooperative,United States,Wisconsin,"4 ins long, 2 ins high, 2 ins wide",8oz,,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Although true Limburger originates in Europe, this American version has, over the years, become an iconic American cheese. Having been enormously popular in the United States in the early to mid part of the 20th century, Limburger was made in several locations across the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, until the cheese style gradually fell out of favor. Now Myron Olson at the Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Green County, Wisconsin, is the sole producer of Limburger in the United States. Chalet`s Limburger is produced under the Country Castle label. Most people know Limburger for its notoriously pungent aroma, which is invariably much stronger than its flavor. The aroma is a result of the cheeses being surface ripened; they`re washed with a solution of brine and Brevibacterium linens at regular intervals during the maturation. Some blocks are released after just a couple of weeks, while others mature for over three months.The rind of the cheese is orange in color and sticky, while the interior paste is pale yellow. While young blocks are slightly rubbery in texture, aged versions develop a softer, more yielding paste with increasingly savory, pungent flavors.Wedge some extra-aged Limburger between slices of rye bread with raw red onion and mustard, and you`ve got yourself a classic Monroe, Wisconsin sandwich. For drink pairings, try either a darker Belgian style ale or an Alsacian white wine."
Limburger (German),Zurwies Cooperative Dairy ,,Bavaria,"5 ins long, 2.5 ins wide, 2 ins high",8oz,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Early production of Limburger was established in the Limburg region of Belgium during the 19th century when it was created by an enterprising group of Trappist monks. The cheese quickly became popular and was copied shortly afterwards by the Germans, who began production of the cheese in 1830 in the Allgäu region and swiftly adopted it as their own. Germany is now the leading producer of Limburger although variations of the cheese can be found in the USA, Belgium and the Netherlands. Although there are few artisanal producers of Limburger left, Bavaria is considered by many to produce some of the best and, specifically, the Zurwies Cooperative Dairy where the cheese is made under the direction of Anton Holzinger. Milk for production is sourced from local, organic farms and comes from cows that are guaranteed not to have consumed silage. (Silage is often considered to adversly affect milk flavors.) Upon arrival at the Zurwies Cooperative Dairy, the milk is pasteurized. Consequently, the cheese has a relatively mild flavor despite its slightly pungent aroma. The exterior rind is pale orange-brown in color and quite thin, a result of the regular washings the cheeses receive during their maturation. The interior paste is a pale straw color and the texture soft and yielding, becoming runnier with age. Flavors are mild, grassy and mushroomy with a delicate tang on the finish. Limburger pairs very well with Belgian style ales."

Lincolnshire Poacher,Lincolnshire Poacher Cheese,United Kingdom,Lincolnshire,"12 ins diameter, 12 ins high",44 lbs, www.lincolnshirepoachercheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Lincolnshire Poacher is produced by brothers Tim and Simon Jones at their farm at Ulceby Grange, near Alford, on the eastern edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds in England.The farm has been in the family since 1917 and Tim and Simon are the fourth generation to run the business. Although dairying started at Ulceby Grange in the 1970`s, it wasn`t until later that Simon began to experiment with cheese production.Lincolnshire is not renowned as dairying country. However, the farm is situated in an unusually chalky area that makes for excellent grazing and successful milk production. Milk comes from their own herd of Friesian cows.With the assistance of Welsh cheesemaker Dougal Campbell, creator and producer of Tyn Gryg, cheesemaking at Ulceby Grange started in 1992. The cheese was so well received, that in 1995 the brothers expanded the creamery and hired Richard Tagg to be their full time cheesemaker. Richard is still head cheesemaker.Produced in hefty 44lb. cyclinders, Lincolnshire Poacher is largely based on a traditional, Somerset cheddar recipe, although with certain small differences. Warm milk from each morning`s milking is combined in the vat with cooled milk from the previous evening.After adding starter culture and traditional rennet, the milk coagulates and is cut to release much of the whey. After further stirring, the curds are ""cheddared"" (ie cut into blocks and stacked) and salted before being transferred into cheese molds.Cheeses are pressed in their molds for 36 hours and matured in temperature and humidity controlled maturing rooms for between 12-24 months.Unlike its cloth wrapped cheddar counterparts, Lincolnshire Poacher has a very firm, natural rind that protects the paste of the cheese. The rind is a mottled brown and gray color with a smooth surface.The interior of the cheese is a golden, staw-colored yellow, becoming slightly darker towards the rind. The paste has a smooth texture with no ""eyes"" (holes).Flavors are of fruit, with occasional tastes of pineapple as well as toasted nuts and grass."
Lindy Hop (Ceased Production),Dancing Cow Farm,United States,Vermont,"4.5 ins diameter, 5 ins high",1.5 lbs or 4 lbs,www.dancingcowcheese.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Lindy Hop is made by Steve and Karen Getz at Dancing Cow Farm, near Bridport, Vermont, from the milk of their own herd of cows. The farm is a pasture-based dairy. No pesticides, herbicides or petroleum-based products are used on the fields. The cows graze on clovers, dandelion, trefoil, and a variety of grasses. The animals live outside during the grazing season, occasionally taking a break in the shade of the barn on hot, humid summer days. The Getzs make their own hay, and after composting the cow manure, spread it on the fields. Milking and cheesemaking are seasonal and take place from March to November when the cows are either grazing on pasture or being fed dry hay. Milk for cheesemaking is uncooled and transferred directly into the cheese room from the milking parlor - the perfect temperature to begin the cheese production process. Dancing Cow Farm produces four cheeses; Bourrée, Menuet, Sarabande and Lindy Hop. The inspiration for production of Lindy Hop emerged from a dialog with Matt Jennings, owner of Farmstead, a cheese store in Rhode Island. Matt encouraged the Getzs to make a blue cheese to best showcase their farmstead milk. Since all the Dancing Cow cheeses are named after dances, Lindy Hop is christened after a 1920`s dance that originated in Harlem, NY and was very popular in Blues and Jazz clubs. The recipe is loosely based on the recipe for Fourme d`Ambert, blue cheese made in the Auvergne region of France. The curd for Lindy Hop is made from the warm, fresh milk of a single milking of the Getz`s cows. Wheels are hand-salted and pierced in order to allow the development of the blue veining and a soft cream Flavors of Lindy Hop are mild, rich and unctious, with notes of grass and a full, creamy mouthfeel. Cheeses have a natural, brown-gray colored rind, encasing a straw yellow interior, dotted with pockets and veins of blue. Cheeses are available year round and produced in both 1.5 and 4 lb wheels."

Like most monastic communities, the monks at La Dalmerie support themselves by practicing sustainable agriculture on their property. Beginning in 2001, the monks cleared and reclaimed approximately 30 hectares of previously abandoned land which which provides ideal forage such as thyme for their herd of dairy goats. Milk from the goats is used for cheesemaking, which takes place seasonally from spring to autumn under the careful supervision of Father Marcel. In order to meet new European regulations, a complex of buildings consisting of a goat barn, a cheesemaking facility and additional storage were constructed, all of which incorporate state of the art technology that allows the monks to carefully control milk and cheese quality. Cheeses are sold to various French affineurs for finishing before being released at an age of about 3-4 weeks. Lingot Saint Nicolas has a wrinkled rind, ranging in color from ivory (pictured) to a golden straw yello. The interior paste is slightly flaky and fudge-like with a semi-soft texture. Flavors of the pasture are clearly reflected in the cheese, which has light yet distinctive notes of thyme and herbs balanced with a rich earthy essence."

Like all of the Marin County-based creamery’s cheeses its name, which translates to “water,” is based on the language of the coastal region’s original inhabitants: the Miwok tribe. “From everything we’ve come to learn about this tribe we know they took excellent care of the land,” says co-owner Tamara Hicks. “Since we have so many school age tours, we wanted to educate people about those who lived on this land and had such great respect for it—and teach some of the few words that are still known.” Hicks and her husband David Jablons purchased Toluma Farms’ 160 acres of rolling green hills in 2003, and began sheep dairying four years later. In 2012, with some help from local grants and organizations, the duo built Tomales Farmstead Creamery and began making cheese. Today the repertoire includes goat, sheep, and mixed-milk cheeses, made with farmstead milk from Toluma’s 100-plus East Friesian sheep and 200-plus goats. Creamy Jersey cow’s milk is also sometimes used, sourced from a neighbor’s farm two miles down the road. Liwa is the youngest, softest ofTomales’ offerings, made with 100% goat’s milk.Looks are deceiving; this fresh chèvre is pretty and simple on the eyes, but surprisingly complex in flavor.

Livarot,La Fromagerie Graindorge,France,Normandie,"1.5 ins high, 3-5 ins diameter",8oz - 3 lbs,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Named after a market town in Normadie, Northern France, Livarot is produced from raw cow’s milk. It also carries a nickname “The Colonel”, due to the five rush bands that encircle the cheese which resemble the shoulder stripes of a colonel’s uniform. According to its AOC name protected designation, cheeses have to be made within a 12 mile radius of the town and only from the milk of the Normandie cow. Livarot is thought to have been created by monks about 700 years ago although now the raw milk version is only made by one remaining dairy, La Fromagerie Graindorge whose owner, Thierry Graindorge is the third generation to make and mature the cheeses. For production of Livarot, semi-skimmed milk is used and allowed to “ripen” for 24 hours before being heated which is when the rennet is added. Curds are cut carefully into small cubes, mixed until they become pea sized and then poured into tall round molds in two steps to ensure the dense texture of the cheese. The molds are turned several times during the first 24 hours before being unmolded and dipped in a brine solution. Cheeses are then transferred to wire racks and transferred to an aging room, where they are dipped in brine several more times over the ensuing six week maturation period. The brine is dyed red with the annato seed (from a South American shrub) which in turn colors the cheeses a deep red on the rind. The salt contained within the brine encourages the growth of the bacterium linens mold that gives the cheese it pungent aroma and moist almost gritty rind. Finally, each cheese is wrapped with five narrow strips of the leaf of the water sedge. The leaves are harvested in July and August and then dried and split. Before being used, they’re boiled for several hours and then wrapped around each cheese. Originally, this was to help preserve the cheese’s shape but today it is for form and tradition rather than function, though it is a requirement for the AOC label. The rind of Livarot is deep orange-red in color, with gentle ridges resulting from maturing on the wire racks and the contrasting sedge bands around the sides of the cheese. The interior texture is dense, springy and slightly open. Flavors are powerful and aromatic and feels quite heavy on the tongue with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Livarot pairs very well with Calvados, produced in the same area as well as an Alsacian wine."

The ranch became a family operation years later when Will Lafranchi, Fredolino’s eldest son took over running the business. Throughout this period, family connections to Switzerland remained strong and Will, along with his family, visited many times. These visits were filled with locally produced food, including artisanal cheeses at every meal. Inspired by his experiences in the old country, Will dreamed of producing great cheese on his ranch. Unfortunately, Will was unable to achieve this dream during his lifetime, but his children who now run the ranch, founded Nicasio Valley Cheese Company. Nicasio Valley Cheese focuses on bringing cheeses inspired by their family heritage to the U.S. Using rotational grazing for their herd of 400 cows and sustainable practices throughout the ranch, 100% of their herd is certified organically raised and their milk is used for the production of cheese.

Lord of the Hundreds,Traditional Cheese Dairy,United Kingdom,East Sussex,"4” tall, 7” wide",10 lbs,www.traditionalcheesedairy.co.uk,Sheep,,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Owned and operated by Cliff and Julie Dyball who purchased the dairy in 2002 after careers in finance and insurance, Traditional Cheese Dairy focuses on making hand-made raw milk cheeses. Located in the village of Stonegate in East Sussex, UK, the dairy produces cheeses made from the cow, sheep and goat’s milk of local single herd family farms. Today, the dairy produces about five tons of cheese every month that they sell at local farmer’s markets as well as stores throughout England. Recently, they have started to export to the United States and Canada. The unusual name of this award winning cheese is in reference to tax collectors who worked on behalf of the local Lords who, during Saxon times, would oversee a region consisting of 100 Shires. On the Traditional Cheese dairy property is a marker where the people gathered to pay their taxes. Aged for 4 months, Lord of the Hundreds is produced from raw sheep’s milk and is square-shaped with convex sides. This is because the cheese is ladled into basket molds without pressing. The weight of the cheese forces the sides to round outward during aging. The cheeses are rubbed and turned every other day during the aging process, which creates a white and light brown natural rind.Underneath is a golden yellow paste, which is darker toward the outside of the cheese. The texture is dry and a bit grainy, rather like an aged Pecorino or Parmigiano-Reggiano. Its flavor is sweet and savory with notes of grass, roasted hazelnuts and salty caramel.  With its balance of sweet and savory flavors, Lord of the Hundreds is lovely when served with Membrillo or quince jam on a cheese board. Many chefs use this cheese as an alternative to Parmigiano-Reggiano. Lord of the Hundreds is best paired with a medium-bodied Pinot-Noir or a Cream Ale as a beer selection."
Lou Bergier Pichin,Fattorie Fiandino,Italy,Piedmont,"8 ins diameter, 2.5 ins high",13.25 lbs,www.fattoriefiandino.it/,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"For brothers Egidio and Mario Fiandino, butter and cheese production is a matter of family tradition. Their forefather, Stephano Fiandino, founded what was to become Fattorie Fiandino at the turn of the 18th century when he moved to the Valle Maira in Piedmont from Milan to raise sheep and make cheese. In the 1920’s, the brothers’ grandfather, Magno, purchased the estate where the current Fattorie Fiandino is located from the Earls Grimaldi del Poggetto. Due to the respect that Egidio and Mario have toward their family history, the culture of Piedmont and the ecology of the Valle Maira, Fattorie Fiandino only uses traditional techniques in the production of their butter and cheese. They stay away from much of the technology used in industrial production of dairy products. However, Fattorie Fiandino has also embraced some new technologies. For example, about a third of their power comes from solar panels installed in 2005. Lou Bergier Pichin is a raw cow’s milk cheese made in honor of Fattorie Fiandino’s founder, Stephano Fiandino. The name Lou Bergier is the term in local Occitan language for shepherd, a fitting homage to “Magno,” a shepherd himself. The cheese is made using an amalgamation of cheese-making techniques reflecting the cultural heritage of Piedmont. The use of thistle rennet to coagulate the milk is inspired by Spanish and Portugese cheese recipes while the tome style of the cheese is distinctly French. The name “Lou Bergier” reflects the fact that the French used to control the Piedmont region and the use of day-old whey to generate starter cultures is a largely Italian process.Aged for sixty days, Lou Bergier has a velvety, mottled brown and grey rind and a semi-soft, pale yellow paste with small eyes. The aroma is of mushrooms and damp caves with hints of butter and barnyard. It is a bright, freshly flavored cheese with floral notes and a touch of citrus. Its mouthfeel is smooth and rich.Crisp white wines and lightly fruity red wines work best with this cheese. Serve Lou Bergier with fruit pastes such as membrillo, sunflower or brier honey, pumpkin ginger compote or lambrusco wine jelly."

What’s his secret? “Happy, healthy cows,” Morin says, of the Holstein and Swiss Brown herd. “It all starts with the milk, and the care we show the cheese as we make it.”Morin’s children represent the fifth generation already at work on the French dairy farm, La Ferme Louis d’Or, and—across the street in the village of Sainte-Élizabeth de Warwick—at La Fromagerie du Presbytère. The farmstead cheese business takes its name from the rectory (presbytère, in French), which the Morin family acquired in 2005 from the Roman Catholic church next door. They began their cheese making in 2007. Four years later, Louis d`Or swept the Canadian Cheese Grand Prix, winning three categories and the coveted title of Grand Champion. In 2014, it won Best Quebec Cheese and Best Firm Cheese with Holes at the Canadian Cheese Awards.The 90-plus-pound wheels of Louis d`Or boast an orange-tan washed rind embossed with their name. (Louis was the second-generation Morin to run the farm; he added ""d`Or"" as a nod to the 17th-century King of France).

Deep aromas of nuts and fruit characterize the velvety, buttery-textured paste, and complex flavors melt on the tongue.Enhance the complex flavors of Louis d’Or with lightly wooded chardonnay or a lighter Côtes du Rhône."
Lowcountry Whey,Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse,United States,South Carolina,4 in diameter x 2.5 in height,14 oz,www.charlestoncheesehouse.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to pasteFlavor added to rind,"Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse crafts and ages a range of cheeses on location in Charleston, South Carolina. Since 2014 the creamery has been owned by chefs Greg Tatis and Monica Jaramillo, who specialize in recipe development and cheesemaking, as well as by Pete and Heather Holmes, who specialize in sales and marketing. The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw and thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. Lowcountry Whey is a flavored version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park. Described as a cross between a brie and a farm cheese, the production process for these these bloomy-rinded discs is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling. Discs are aged from three to four weeks. To make this version, locally sourced honey is incorporated into the curd, and the top of the cheese is crusted with Sneaky Hot Pecans produced by Charleston-based roaster Molly & Me. Charleston’s cheesemakers chose to top the cheese with the pecans in order to avoid overmixing the curds. Although they don’t add more cultures to the top of the cheese, the white fuzzy mold grows around the pecans, so that the rind almost entirely covers this upper layer.With beige, fuzzy surface and a white paste with small holes, Lowcountry Whey is quite mild, with flavorings only adding a hint of grass, wood, butter and slight floral notes from the honey.Pair Lowcountry Whey with an apple cider, a hard cider, or with raw or grilled granny smith apples."

Maggie's Round,Cricket Creek Farm,,Massachusetts,"7 ins diameter, 3 ins high",4 lbs,www.cricketcreekfarm.com,Cow,,Hard,Microbial,Natural,,,"Produced near Williamstown, Massachusetts, Maggie`s Round is made at Cricket Creek, one of the oldest dairy farms in the region. The farm was bought in 2002 by the Sabot family with a view to developing a farmstead cheesemaking operation. After considering and experimenting with various options, a small herd of Jersey cows was bought and a new milking parlor constructed to replace the previous one. In tandem, it was decided to have a grass-based operation and also to construct a cheesemaking facility. Finally, in 2004, the Sabots began milking their first animals under the careful eye of Brian Stone, who managed the farm in the initial stages. A second phase of the plan actually saw cheese production get under way seriously. A number of Brown Swiss cows were purchased from Sam Dixon at Shelburne Farms, in order to supplement the Jersey milk. The milk of Brown Swiss cows is particularly sought after for cheesemaking, since it naturally has an excellent fat-protein ratio. Cricket Creek produces two cheeses, of which Maggie`s round is the better known. Made from raw milk, Maggie`s is aged for at least four months and has a very smooth, firm, slightly waxy texture and a distinctive ridged rind that clearly shows the basket type mold in which it was formed. Flavors are sweet and nutty, with herbaceous overtones and hints of butter. It has a long, pleasing finish."
Mahon,Various,Spain,"Menorca, Balearic Islands","8 in. square, 2-3 in. high",5-6 lbs,,Cow,,Hard,Animal,Washed,,,"Mahon is produced on the island of Menorca, the most northern of the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean, near Spain. Named after the main port on the island, Mahon is unusual for this region since it is produced from cow`s milk. Milk for production comes from approximately 600 farms, some of which make their own cheese, while others sell their milk to other producers or cooperatives. Mahon was originally made using milk from the island`snative sheep. However, producers switched to cow`s milk after a brief but formative British occupation, which brought Friesian dairy cattle to the island in the 18th century. Due to Menorca`s remote geographical position, the production of any perishable food destined for consumption beyond the shores of the island traditionally had to be geared towards shelf-stable and versatile products, and such is the case with Mahon. As a result, Mahon can be found in several different stages, ranging from a semi-aged cheese (two months) to very old (ten months). Artisanal versions are made using raw milk and often have a more complex flavor that becomes more apparent as they get older. Industrial versions made from pasteurized milk are also available but tend to be milder in flavor. Artisanal version of Mahon are pillow-shaped since the curds are placed in a cloth, which is then knotted at the corners to make the edges more rounded. To allow a rind to develop, the cheeses are brined before being aged in maturing rooms. During the aging process, they are rubbed at regular intervals with a blend of olive oil, butter, and paprika, giving the cheese itsred-orange rind. When young, Mahon`s texture is close, dense, and crumbly, but slightly moist. The paste is bone-white in color, with occasional ""eyes,"" or holes. As it matures, itscolor darkens and the texture becomes drier and firmer.Younger versions of Mahon taste buttery, fruity, and tart, overlaid with a slight sourness and hint of salt. With age, these flavors intensify; some older wheels can be very salty and piquant.On Menorca, Mahon is traditionally eaten by sprinkling the cheese with freshly ground black pepper, olive oil,and tarragon. Mahon needs an assertive wine to stand up to its intense flavors, so try madeira or rioja."

The creation of Malvarosa was initiated as an effort to save the virtually extinct local breed of Guirra sheep by utilizing their milk to make the cheese.Malvarosa is made using pasteurized milk. Cheeses destined for the Spanish market are formed in the traditional Manchego molds. However, cheeses due to be sold in the United States are treated differently: after being placed in cheesecloth, the curds are pressed and drained by bringing the corners of the cloth together and tying them tightly to squeeze out excess whey. Once released from the cloth, the curds take on the imprint and creases of the cloth, as well as the distinctive, pointed ""servilleta"" shape where the knot of the cloth was tied.Cheeses are aged for a minimum of three months beore being released.The texture of Malvarosa is firm and smooth and slightly moist. The paste is a creamy, pale straw color.Flavors are rich and buttery, with notes of caramel and toasted nuts and have the accompanying sweetness of the sheep`s milk.Malvarosa pairs well with a full bodied Rioja."

Manchego,Various,Spain,Castile-La Mancha,"8ins diameter, 6 ins high",6.5 lbs,,Sheep,,Semi SoftFirm,Animal,Waxed,,,"Produced in Castile La Mancha, in Spain, Manchego is probably the best known of the Spanish sheep`s milk cheeses. Production of Manchego has been regulated since 1984, and authentic Manchego can only be made exclusively from the whole milk of Manchega sheep, raised in the La Mancha region. Because of these regulations, cheeses made outside the designated region of La Mancha are known as ""Manchego style"" cheeses—despite being similar in size and type—and cannot legally be named Manchego. The La Mancha region consists of a vast, high plateau, more than 600 meters (2,600ft.) above sea level, that extends between the adjoining provinces of Toledo, Cuenca, Ciudad Real, and Albacete, all in the Castile-La Mancha Autonomous Region, southeast of Madrid.The cheese is produced in clearly defined regions where the climate is extremely continental, with cold winters and hot summers. Manchego`s shape is characteristic and defined, due to the traditional use of esparto grass molds which leave an imprinted zigzag pattern on the sides of the cheese. The small wooden boards used for pressing the cheese mark the Manchego`s typical wheat ear pattern into the top and bottom of the wheels. Manchego has a long tradition, and today there are two basic types of Manchego produced: farmhouse versions made with unpasteurized sheep`s milk, and the industrial versions that can be made with either pasteurized or unpasteurized milk. Still, in both cases, milk from Manchega sheep is the only type used. The texture of young cheeses (semi curado - 3 months of age) is relatively moist and supple, with a pale, cream-colored paste. More mature versions (viejo - aged one year) have a texture that is drier and more crumbly and a butterscotch-colored paste.Younger versions of Manchego have aromas of slightly sour cream and cheesecake and sweet, tangy flavors with notes of hay, grass,and fruit. As cheeses mature (curado - 6 months), the flavors mellow and become more rounded, gaining notes of caramel and nuts, while maintaining a pronounced acidity.The flavor is sweet and lingering.Manchego pairs well with a glass of fino sherry and a slice of fig cake."

Produced in Castile-La Mancha, in Spain, Manchego is probably the best known of the Spanish sheep`s milk cheeses. It`s a cheese with an incredibly longstanding tradition, with a production process that`s been protected with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) since 1984. Authentic Manchego can only be made exclusively from the whole milk of Manchega sheep raised in the La Mancha region. The cheese must be formed in esparto grass molds that imprint a zigzag pattern on its rind, while the small wooden boards used for pressing the cheese mark the Manchego`s typical wheat ear pattern into the top and bottom of the wheels. Despite the similarities regulated under the PDO, versions of Manchego can vary from farmhouse versions made with unpasteurized sheep`s milk to industrial versions that can be made with either pasteurized milk. The 1605 version is a perfect example of the former—a farmstead cheese named for the year Cervantes wrote Don Quixote—produced by Finca Sierra La Solana. Farming since 1878, Finca Sierra La Solana cultivates vineyards, olive groves, and almond plantations, and herds 500 ewes to produce their version of the classic cheese. Manchego 1605 is aged six to nine months, allowing it to develop a slightly granular texture and earthy, caramel-y flavor.Like a classic Manchego, 1605 has an earthy, savory flavor and pronounced acidity with a toothsome texture, but offers a complex mix of sweet notes of nutmeg and caramel. It is reminiscent of sugared almonds and a hint of hay with a long, lingering finish.Manchego pairs extremely well with full-bodied, tannic red wines and a slice of fig-almond cake or a handful of fresh grapes."

Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time.

The sheet of stretched curd is then wrapped around the filling and pinched off at the top. The result is a ball of cheese that when cut, spills its creamy contents onto the plate.One word: creamy. While the outside layer of mozzarella is firm and chewy, the inside melts on the tongue, and a pleasant, delicate semi-sweetness yields a hint of maple. It’s like vanilla ice cream, but better.This cheese would be perfect on top of hot buttermilk pancakes with salty pecans, or substituting ice cream in any a la mode dish."

The “aging” process continues in the jar, as buttons absorb the flavors of the savory herbs and flavorings while they marinate in a mixture of oils, including organic canola oil and/or California extra virgin olive oil and French truffle oil. Buttons remain creamy in the jar and hold their shape. Located in a state-of-the-art creamery in Sonoma, California, Laura Chenel`s has been in operation since the late 1970s. Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States.

Milk for production comes from family goat dairies located in the western United States.High-quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure animal health, nutrition,and general well being.It’s really the flavorings in the jar that characterize the flavor of Cabecou. Buttons are mild yet creamy and tart, infused with each marinade`s flavors. Cabecou is great on salad or served with some crusty bread. Laura Chenel’s cheesemakers recommend brushing fresh Roma tomatoes with some of the oil from the jar, then roasting them until they begin to brown, topping them with a layer of Cabecou buttons and then baking until the buttons soften and get toasty on top.Pair Cabecou with a crisp, light-bodied California pinot grigio with pepper or arugula notes."
Marinated Ciliegine ,Crave Brothers Farmstead Classics,United States,Wisconsin,,,www.cravecheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Flavored,,,"Located in Waterloo, Wisconsin, Crave Brothers is a family owned farm and cheesemaking business, operated by four brothers: Charles, Thomas, Mark and George.The siblings, who all grew up on their family’s 40 cow dairy in Wisconsin have arranged the division of labor so that each brother has an area of responsibility best suited to their interests and skills. Tom manages the crops and equipment upkeep, Mark is responsible for milking operations, George oversees and manages cheesemaking and Charles oversees bookeeping.Having originally rented a farm just west of Madison in the early 1980`s, where they milked just under 60 cows, the brothers later purchased 300 acres of farmland in Waterloo, a move which allowed them to farm on a much larger scale, construct a new dairy, and grow their own animal feed.For years they sold fluid milk, until milk prices fell and the brothers needed to think of ways to add value to their milk. In 2001 they decided to go into cheese production.Today, the farm milks 1,100 Holsteins that George proudly describes as “the Cadillac of dairy breeds”. The cheesemaking operation is located across the road from the barns and milking parlor, and milk is pumped directly to the cheese room via a pipe laid under the road.In addition to making cheese, as with many modern cheesemaking operations, the farm is on the edge of environmental stewardship. As such, the Crave Brothers’ facility is carbon negative, a result of utilizing the waste from the cows by channeling it into an computer-controlled anaerobic digester. This produces methane gas that powers an internal combusion engine, in turn generating enough electricity to power the farm, cheesemaking facility and 300 area homes.Crave Brothers produce a variety of fresh and aged cheeses from their three cheesemaking vats. Three vats are designed to each hold 26,000lbs of milk and these are primarily used for production of fresh and part skim mozzarella. A fourth, smaller vat holds 5,000lbs and is used to produce Les Frères and Petit Frère.Made in the style of Italian fresh mozzarella, Crave Brothers’ version is soft and light, making it ideal for use in salads or simply served with fresh tomatoes. Milk is only hours old when it is transformed into Crave Brothers’ Mozzarella.Marinated Ciliegine are small, cherry (cilliegine) sized balls of mozzarella that Crave Brothers marinate in a blend of olive and canola oil together with their own spice mix."

Marinated Feta (Brazos Valley),Brazos Valley Cheese,United States,Texas,,12 oz,www.brazosvalleycheese.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Microbial,Rindless,,Flavor added to rind,"15 years ago, Rebeccah Salmeri decided to teach herself how to make cheese. Living in Waco, Texas in the traditional agricultural and crafts community Homestead Heritage, Rebeccah was looking for a way to use some extra spring milk that the community’s Brown Swiss cows had been producing. Using books and experimentation, she gradually began producing dairy products, hard and soft cheeses, eventually teaching her craft to others. In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheeses are raw milk cheeses. This feta is produced in small blocks and aged for at least 60 days in a 3% salt brine. The blocks are then chopped down into small chunks and marinated with olive oil, dried tomatoes and garlic.The oily marinade is mild enough not to overpower the crumbly, salty cheese. Slight bitterness and herbal notes are present.Co-owner Marc Kuehl suggests using this feta in salads or with eggs."

Over the years, a herd of three goats has grown to several hundred, while original four-gallon vat batches have grown to a 150-gallon vat operation. A true farmstead dairy, cheeses at Split Creek are made using only milk from animals raised on-site.   One of several fresh and aged cheese varieties produced on the farm, this goat’s milk feta is sliced and packaged in jars containing sundried tomatoes, garlic, and herbs in a mix of olive oil and canola oil. Kicking off with a hint of marcona almonds, flavors in these juicy cubes of feta then give way to olive brine and a medley of Mediterranean herbs. Texture is bready at first before crumbling and melting in the mouth. All in all, it tastes like a whole pizza in one bite. “We serve it with watermelon and cucumber, [and use it] in manicotti,” says farm manager Jessica Bell. When the last savory cubes are plucked from the jar (it’ll happen fast), the leftover marinade adds fragrant flavors of sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and herbs to pasta and salads."
Marinated Sheep & Goat Cheese,Meredith Dairy,Australia,Victoria,Varies,Varies,www.meredithdairy.com,GoatSheep,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,NoneFlavor Added,Fresh,,"Behold, Australia`s most decorated goat cheese. Often referred to as ""marinated feta,"" Marinated Sheep & Goat Cheese is a much-beloved staple that has made waves down under and built a steady following stateside. The cheese hails from Meredith Dairy outside of Melbourne, which is among the largest farmstead goat`s milk product producers in Australia. Owners Sandy and Julie Cameron have created an award-winning business that focuses on sustainable agricultural practices and continuous research into animal husbandry. A focus on sustainability means that the Farm does not grow any GMO crops, while portions of the property have been set aside as native habitat where grazing animals are not allowed. The Camerons have also replanted thousands of indigenous trees on the property as windbreaks and to prevent soil erosion. With their flocks of goats and sheep, the Camerons have established an animal husbandry schedule that ensures milk is available year-round. At any given time, a quarter of each herd is pregnant and a quarter have given birth. The animals are fed a mixture of grain and hay, and are also put out to pasture during the spring and summer months. The results of these practices include not only a thriving farm, but also a constant supply of fresh milk that is then turned into cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products like this marinated beauty. Produced from a mix of goat`s and sheep`s milk, the fresh cheese is cubed and plunged into a mixture of olive oil, garlic, peppercorns, and herbs.The cheese`s flavor is mild and fresh with a good balance of acidity and salt, enhanced by the addictive blend of olive oil and spices that it is marinated in.Pair it with a sparkling wine, a semillon, or an oaked chardonnay."

Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.Made only seasonally with milk sourced from Wisconsin sheep, Marisa is named after Sid Cook’s daughter.The texture of the cheese is firm and quite dense.  Flavors are sweet and mellow - a result of the sheep’s milk - yet quite complex.Good pairings for Marisa include Chianti, Pinot Grigio and lighter Lagers."
Maroilles,Various,France,"Picardy, Nord-Pas-de-Calais","5 in square, 2.5 cm height ",1.5 lbs,www.maroilles-infos.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Maroilles is a semi-soft washed rind cheese from the North of France. After it was invented in the 10th century by a monk in the Abbey of Maroilles, it quickly grew to fame, and was noted as the preferred cheese of several French kings (Philip II, Louis IX, Charles VI and Francis I).Traditionally the farmers in the villages surrounding the Abbey of Maroilles were asked to convert their cow’s milk into young squares of Maroilles cheese every June 24th, the day of Saint Jean Baptiste. On the following 1st of October, the feast day of Saint Remi, the villagers would donate the aged cheeses to the Abbey, and the monks would distribute them to the Champagne grape harvesters for lunch and dinner. October 1st is still known as Maroilles Day in the region.In making Maroilles, the curd is shaped and salted before being removed from its hoop. Young squares rest 10 days in a ventilated area, where they begin to develop a light blue fuzzy surface. They’re then moved to an aging cellar and washed and brushed for several weeks, developing an orange-red rind due to the introduction of Brevibacterium linens bacteria. Maroilles AOC can be made in four sizes, and required ripening times vary accordingly. For ‘Traditionelle’ Maroilles (720g), ripening time is 5 weeks minimum; for ‘Sorbais’ (550g) it’s 4 weeks; for ‘Mignon’ (350g), 3 weeks; and for Quart (180g), at least 2 weeks.Nicknamed vieux pant, or “old stinker,” Maroilles is characterized by a pungent smell. The taste is soft and creamy, with a slight sweetness and lingering flavor. It’s best enjoyed from May to August, but is also good from March until December. Maroilles is a great end-of-meal cheese. It goes well with a brown ale, a French cider, a refined brandy, or an aromatic white wine such as a late-harvest Gewürztraminer. "
Mascarpone Burrata,Fiore di Nonno,United States,Massachusetts,,4.75 oz,www.fioredinonno.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),Flavor added to paste,"Lourdes Smith comes from a long line of Italian cheesemakers; her great-grandfather Alphonso Fiore made cheese in Italy and then in Hoboken, New Jersey after immigrating to the US. She was inspired early on by watching her grandfather Joe, who had taken over Alphonso’s shop, making mozzarella, ricotta and basket cheese. Her business in Somerville, Massachusetts, whose name translates into “my grandfather’s flower,” is a salute to him. Lourdes sources mozzarella curd from partner farms. She recently worked with Shy Brothers Farm in Westport, MA, which is run by two sets of fraternal twins, to develop a curd recipe using their antibiotic and hormone-free cow’s milk. Shy Brothers’ cows graze on pasture in a peninsula that juts out into the Westport River. After Lourdes receives the curd, she transforms it by hand each morning in her Somerville, MA kitchen. The cheesemaking process begins by breaking the curd into even pieces using a tool called a guitar. Lourdes then adds hot water to the curd, which slowly brings it up to melting temperature so that it can be stretched using a wooden paddle, then shaped.The resulting mozzarella is moist and refreshing, soft in texture, milky and buttery with a hint of salt. Burrata originated in the Murgia area of Italy. It’s a disk of fresh mozzarella that is shaped into a pouch, inside of which is stuffed stracciatella, a mix of fresh cream, salt and curds that have been pulled into strings. Fiore di Nonno Burrata is made in several unique combinations that play with sweetness, savory and tangy flavors. Mascarpone Burrata is filled with Italian mascarpone cheese, which lends a buttery flavor, and Greek yogurt for a bit of a tang.Lourdes suggests serving Mascarpone Burrata with smoked trout, saltine crackers and bread and butter pickles, or with citrus fruits."

The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita.Mastorazio is a pecorino that is aged for 12 to 18 months. It has a natural rough brown rind and a dense pale yellow paste. The scent of the cheese is of milk and herbs. Its flavor is herbaceous with a touch of spice.

Frederick Maytag, a son of German immigrants, settled in Iowa in the 1860s and, after successfully establishing a farm implement company, designed a washing machine that would eventually catapult the company to fame and fortune. Frederick’s son Elmer was an entirely different character, finding more satisfaction in establishing a herd of award winning Holstein-Friesian cows. Elmer’s son, Frederick II, inherited both the farm and his grandfather’s business acumen, establishing Maytag cheese production in 1941. Cow’s milk for production is sourced from the farm’s own herd. It`s heated, cultures and rennet are added and, after the curd has formed, cut into cubes in the vat. The whey is then drained off and the remaining curds are mixed with a blue mold powder before being scooped into hoops and pressed. After unmolding, the young cheeses are soaked in a brine solution for several hours before being transferred to the caves—which are dug into a hillside behind the cheesemaking room—for further aging. During a four- to six-month aging process, wheels are pierced to allow air into the interior. The enzymes and bacteria react with the air, allowing for the development of blue veins throughout the cheese. Prior to sale and shipping, each wheel is hand-scraped to remove any surface mold before being wrapped in silver foil.The texture of Maytag Blue is firm, moist and slightly crumbly with an ivory colored paste shot through with sapphire colored blue veins. Flavors are rich and cream-like, with an assertive salty note and a savory finish.Drizzle your Maytag Blue with honey or sip a barleywine-style ale alongside it."

Cheesemaker Brenda Jensen wants “every single batch to come out award-winning,” an attitude that has earned Hidden Springs Creamery multiple honors, including a Best of Class title at the 2014 World Championship Cheese Contest. Brenda and her husband, Dean, live in the heart of Amish country. The vision for Hidden Springs Farm and Creamery is to be sustainable - both environmentally and financially. Since the Jensens are in the middle of Amish farm country (Dean works as a councillor for the Amish community), they appreciate Amish values and work practices. They employ Amish friends and neighbors for milking and construction. Percheron draft horses - not tractors - plow their fields, and donkeys keep coyotes and other predators away from their lambs. Brenda has worked to develop several cheeses, and Meadow Melody Grande is her first mixed-milk cheese, using cow’s milk as well as sheep’s milk. Brenda cuts each curd lovingly by hand for all of Hidden Springs’ cheeses. The washed-rind, 13-pound Grande wheels are aged on wooden boards in underground cheese caves for eight to 10 months. Keep your eyes peeled for a smaller, two-pound version known simply as Meadow Melody.With a rich and dense paste underneath an orange-hued rind, Meadow Melody Grande is creamy and buttery with flavors of grass and toffee.Likened to young Manchego, Meadow Melody Grande matches naturally with delicate, slightly salty Serrano ham."

For owner Allison Lakin, becoming a cheesemaker evolved from a background in anthropology, education, and technical theatre. When the opportunity arose in August 2011 to start her own business, without having her own cows, she took the plunge. According to Allison, cheesemaking combines her fascination with science with her love of magic. Milk for production is sourced from a single, certified organic and grass fed herd of Jersey and Jersey cross cows. She is working toward having her own farm, but currently is renting space from another Maine cheesemaker to produce her cheese. Currently, Allison makes cheese a few days each week, producing a variety of fresh and aged cheeses that are sold either via her local farmers’ market, restaurants and specialty food shops in Maine and New England. Named for its shape, Medallion is a small, mold ripened disc, similar in shape to a French Cabecou. For production, curds are allowed to drain for 1 day before being dry salted and transferred to the aging room where they are held for approximately two weeks prior to release.Flavors of the Medallion are sweeter than the Lakin’s Prix de Diane (see separate entry).   A delicate, thin, white rind encases a smooth, rich and velvety interior texture.  Flavors of fresh mushrooms and cream predominate and give a lingering finish.Suggested pairings: Pinot noir. "
Mélange Brie,Marin French Cheeese Co.,United States,California,"4 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",8 oz,www.marinfrenchcheese.com,GoatCow,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the Marin French Cheese Company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. Mélange is a bloomy-rinded brie-style cheese produced using a 50/50 blend of cow`s and goat`s milk.To make the cheese, the milk is pasteurized and poured into `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.) With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. The cheeses are unmolded and brined, then placed on racks to dry before they’re transferred to the aging rooms where they will spend 10-14 days before release. The cheeses are turned once during this time to promote mold growth.The interior texture of Mélange is smooth, velvety and yielding with a bone white-colored paste. Scent is sweet and mild, and flavor is buttery and creamy, with pleasant deep vegetal hints of earth, mushrooms and a mildly goaty tang.Pair Mélange Brie with a California sauvignon blanc or chardonnay."
Melinda Mae,Mystic Cheese Company,United States,Connecticut,,4 lbs,mysticcheese.co,Cow,Pasteurised,,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Mystic Cheese was born in 2013 as a collaboration between Brian Civitello, who has made cheeses of all styles across the United States and Italy, and cheesemonger Jason Sobocinski, owner of Caseus Fromagerie & Bistro in New Haven, Connecticut. After Civitello learned how to make cheese in Italy, he worked for various cheese companies throughout the US, both making cheese and consulting for small family-owned creameries. When Civitello started his own business, Sobocinski was brought in to help make Mystic Cheese a reality. Both have irrepressible enthusiasm for their work and the future of the dairy and cheese industries, as well as for their home state.   The company is known for pioneering the use of “cheese pods,” affordable, transportable cheesemaking facilities built into refurbished shipping containers. The containers are transformed into mobile, industry-standard spaces for efficient cheese production. Currently, Mystic Cheese is in the process of constructing a new cheesemaking space in Groton, CT. The new facility will offer cut-to-order cheese, grilled cheese, charcuterie, cheese boards, and other snacks, catering, and classes.  The most important part of the cheese making process for Mystic is to to highlight the freshness of the milk. All Mystic cheeses are made to keep the integrity of the delicate characteristics of the milk intact so they may be reflected in the final product.  Stemming from Civitello’s Italian training, many of Mystic`s cheeses are inspired by Old World Italian recipes. Created in 2013 as the second cheese the company offered, Melinda Mae is inspired by Robiola. The name comes from the classic Shel Silverstein poem about a little girl who eats a whale starting with the tail.   At about four pounds and square, Melinda Mae is soft-ripened with a bright white, bloomy Penicillium rind. The wheels are aged from 12 to 21 days in a space specially designed to manage the moisture of the cheese. Maintaining the moisture is vital to generating the pudgy, buttery texture that defines Melinda Mae. With its high yeast flavors, this cheese is reminiscent of warm bread topped with rich cultured butter. Melinda Mae’s bright white rind encases a soft, brie-like paste that smells of butter, milk, must, and fungi. The interior paste has a buttery, nutty tang, while a musty umami flavor emerges closer to the rind. This butter bomb of a cheese can pair well with just about anything. Mystic suggests pairing it with tart effervescent beers, pale ales, bubbles, sweeter jams, seasonal sweeter fruits, and crusty bread."

Each farm was given an identifying number which was stamped on top of the can. This allowed the creamery to identify where the milk came from as well as ensuring that the empty cans were returned to the correct farm for cleaning and re-use.By way of an “homage” to this system, cheeses with the Melkbus name are made on single family farms and distinguished by the addition of a number exclusively used by that farm. Recipes and methods used, adhere closely to the traditions of Dutch farmhouse cheese production and the cheeses spend the first few weeks of the aging process maturing on the farms where they are made.Thereafter, they are transferred to “De Producent” - a 98 year old aging facility located in the center of the city of Gouda. It’s here the cheese is aged in a natural environment on wooden boards until ready for sale. Melkbus Baby Swiss 58 is made by hand to a traditional recipe, resulting in the production of a hefty 35lb wheel of cheese that displays all of the distinct characteristics of a fine young Emmentaler. Cheeses are aged for approximately 10 weeks prior to release.  The interior paste is a pale straw color, dotted with large rounded holes.  Given its young age, flavors are mild, yet surprisingly complex.  Notes of butter, roasted walnuts and a hint of tropical fruit are balanced with a classic lingering sweetness, making this appealing either for eating as a table cheese or in the kitchen."

Menage,Carr Valley Cheese Company  ,United States,Wisconsin,"10 ins diameter, 5 ins high",12lbs, www.carrvalleycheese.com ,SheepCowGoat,,Firm,Vegetable,Waxed,,,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties, as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses.The interior paste of Menage is slightly off-white-creamy in color.Made from a pasteurized blend of cow`s, sheep`s and goat`s milk, Menage is designed to be aged, for a slightly more intense flavor and a drier texture. Cheeses are dipped in green wax prior to aging."
Merlot BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,"12-14"" diameter, 4"" high",20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,,,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin.Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible.For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off.The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey. Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation.Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale.For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels of BellaVitano Gold are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing.This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings—in this case, a Merlot wine.While many of Sartori’s Flavored BellaVitanos minimize their infuser, this cheese straightforwardly asserts its Merlot qualities with a big, front-of-the-palate zing and a lingering wine aftertaste. Velvety, creamy flavors mingle with insinuations of blackberry. Pair it with a Shiraz, a Pinot Noir, or of course a Merlot! For beer pairings, try an IPA, a hoppy pilsner or a wheat beer. "

Midnight Moon,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,Northern California,"12 ins diameter, 5-6 ins high",9-11 lbs, www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Firm,Vegetable,Waxed,,,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. In addition to the younger style goat’s milk cheeses made at the Arcata creamery, Mary introduced a new range of matured cheeses to complement and “round out” the Cypress Grove line in 1998. The line is currently comprised of Midnight Moon and Lamb Chopper. These matured, gouda-style cheeses are produced in the Netherlands and sold under the Cypress Grove label. Not only does this relationship help Cypress Grove avoid risking cross contamination (associated with making different kinds of cheeses), but it also addresses the issue of the considerable amount of additional space needed for aging these types of cheeses. Made from pasteurized goat`s milk, wheels are aged at least six months prior to release. The interior paste of Midnight Moon is a warm, ivory color, becoming slightly darker towards the rind. The texture is firm, smooth and dense with a slightly granular mouthfeel.Flavors are of butterscotch and browned butter with both savory notes and a sweetness not normally associated with an aged goat`s cheese. Midnight Moon pairs well with a Rhone style wine or dry sherry."
Miette,Baetje Farms,United States,Missouri,3,0.25 - 0.5 lb,www.baetjefarms.com,SheepGoat,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,," Steve and Veronica Baetje have been making cheese at Baetje Farms in the foothills of the Ozarks since 2006. The Baetjes keep a large herd of Saanen dairy goats, and produce cheese along with several employees. The day`s milking begins each morning at 4 am, and the rest of the day is spent turning that milk into cheese, shipping cheese, handling sales calls and making local deliveries. Goats receive an unlimited supply of filtered spring water to drink from the farm’s spring, and their diet—an all-natural antibiotic-free whole grain ration—is supplemented with organic herbal teas, mineral supplements, locally grown alfalfa hay, and the farm’s pasture. The milking season begins with the birth of spring kids and each doe receives a rest in the winter, giving the goats a break for several months a year. Miette is a French-inspired bloomy rind cheese made from a blend of goat and sheep’s milks. Drained without pressing and dry salted, the cheese is aged only two weeks and is semi-soft when sold.Miette is creamy, mild, sweet and slightly mushroomy, with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency much like that of a baked cheesecake."
Milleens,Quinlan Steele,Ireland,County Cork,"10 ins diameter, 2 ins high / 4 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",3lbs and 8oz,www.milleenscheese.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Milleens is a soft, washed-rind cheese made from pasteurized cow`s milk and was the first `modern` farmstead cheese to be made in Ireland. The Steele family makers of Milleens, live near Castletownbere on the very south western edge of County Cork. Milleens was created in 1976 by Veronica Steele, largely as a response to the transformation of her local grocer into a supermarket and the fact that she was no longer able to buy good cheese for home consumption. Having begun production using the milk from their one cow, named Brisket, making the cheese for their own consumption, Milleens soon began to find a wider audience among local chefs and then further afield in England. Over the years, production expanded along with the number of cows in the herd. However, in the mid 1990`s, the Steele`s had a major setback and lost their cows, with the result that they now source milk from a neighbor`s Friesian herd. The recipe for Millens has remained much the same despite a switch from raw milk to pasteurized. Also, Veronica and Norman Steele`s son, Quinlan has now taken over the cheesemaking from his mother. Milleens is made in two sizes, a 3lb wheel and a smaller 8oz round known as a ""dote"" (which means ""cherished one"" in Gaelic). The geographical location plays an important part in the development and maturation of the cheese, since the dairy is located on the Beara Peninsula, a windswept coastal area that receives more than its fair share of rain. The moist, salty atmosphere is perfect for cultivating the brevibacterium linens culture that gives the cheese its distinctive rind, flavor and aroma. Milleens has a complex array of flavors, that vary according to the seasons. In the spring and summer, the cheese has distinct notes of flowers, herbs and grass gradually changing with the onset of autumn and winter milk when flavors suggest mushrooms and hay. The texture also varies between a very soft, almost spoon-able paste to semi-firm. The rind is a rich orange-brown color and frequently slightly sticky, with a wrinkled appearance. Aromas are assertive and barnyardy. Milleens pairs well with crisp dry white wines, dessert wines and Belgian style ales."
Mimolette,Various,France,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,"8 ins diameter, 6-7 ins height",8 lbs,,Cow,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced around the town of Lille in northern France, Mimolette is an aged cow`s milk cheese. Sometimes referred to as Boule de Lille, presumably for its distinctive, spherical shape, the production of Mimolette has many similarities to Dutch Edam. The origins of this cheese are subject to debate, as some say that the recipe came from the Netherlands, while others claim it was always made in France. Either way, the truth probably rests with an episode during the 17th century, when France was importing a considerable amount of cheese, especially from the Netherlands. The French minister, Colbert, put a stop to any foreign cheese imports and so the inhabitants of northern France started producing their own versions of some of the Dutch cheeses. Voilà,Mimolette was born. Apart from its distinctive shape, Mimolette`s other striking feature is its bright orange color, a result of the use of annato during production. Annatto, which is derived from the seeds of a South American shrub, is a natural food coloring frequently used to give cheeses an orange color. In the case of Mimolette, it`s particularly bright. Mimolette is sold at varying stages of maturity, although the Extra Veille (Extra Aged) cheeses are distinctly different from the younger versions. The minimum maturation is six weeks, at which time the cheeses are still very moist and have not had time to develop much flavor. At the other end of the spectrum, cheeses can be matured for up to 24 months.At this stage, the exterior rind is dark tan in color and usually extremely pitted and marked. It`s common to see a coating of brown dust on the outside, which is a sign of age and the action of cheese mites on the rind. The rind itself will be very dense and hard and often extends up to half an inch into the paste of the cheese. Although edible, the rind does not taste appealing.The interior paste of the cheese is very dense, hard and smooth, with occasional small ""eyes,"" or holes. Flavors are of bacon, caramel, butterscotch and toasted nuts, with an underlying sweetness that is not cloying.Pair Mimolette with either dessert wines or lighter reds such as Rhônes or pinot noirs."
Mini,Meadow Creek Dairy,United States,Virginia,"6 ins square, 1.5 ins high",1 lb,www.meadowcreekdairy.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Meadow Creek Dairy is a family farm located in the mountains of southwest Virginia. At an elevation of 2,800 feet, the combination of pure water, clean air and deep soils produce an ideal environment for growing diverse, mineral-rich pastures. Rick & Helen Feete have been farming since 1980, and over the years have worked extremely hard, focusing their attention on constantly improving the genetics and milk quality of their herd of Jersey cows. Meadow Creek`s cheese production is resolutely seasonal. Milking begins in late March, when all the calves are born, to coincide with the new growth of grass. The cows are never confined and are born and raised on pasture, where they graze a diverse mixture of perennial grasses and legumes, supplemented with some grains, salt and Norwegian kelp. In the fall, when the grass declines, milk production naturally winds down too. Christmas Eve is the last day of the milking season and the beginning of a two-month rest for the cows and the family. Originally called, Mini Grayson, this washed rind cheese has a personality all its own. While the recipe for Mini was based on Meadow Creek’s award-winning Grayson, it is not just a smaller version of its parent cheese. One reason for that is the extra step of washing the cheese in Highland Brewing Company’s Oatmeal Porter during the finishing process. Another reason is that Mini is made in very limited quantities (about 60 wheels per week), with the first wheels available in mid-June. This makes the cheese more seasonal than any of the other cheeses offered by Meadow Creek. Mini is made using Jersey cow milk that is pumped directly from the milking parlor to the cheese-making facility in the Feete’s home. The milk is then heated to 93ºF and the rennet is added. Once the curds and whey have separated, the curds are cut using an automated method that creates corn kernel to hazelnut-sized pieces. The curds are cooked for an additional ten minutes, then drained and put into square shaped hoops. The newly formed cheeses are then brined for the first time and aging begins. The aging process lasts for between 60 and 80 days, during which time the cheeses are washed first with brine, then with beer and flipped to ensure even maturation.The sweet, grassy flavors of a Munster are present in Mini, but it also has hints of the hops and yeast - a result of the beer used to wash it. Underneath its delicate orange-red rind is a yellow paste created by the carotene-rich milk that is used. The texture of the paste is silky and decadent. Mini’s aroma is pungent and strong. Beer is an obvious pairing with Mini. But it is also great with an Alsatian or Riesling wine or even a single malt scotch. Serve it with summer stone fruit such as peaches, or other summer fruits such as cherries. "

The creamery is located at the Volpi Ranch near Petaluma, just north of San Francisco, California, which is also the source for Scanlan`s goat`s milk. Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three. Andante`s Minuet is a soft-ripened, triple crème made using pasteurized goat`s milk with cow`s milk creme fraiche added to the curds.The result is a cheese that combines the richness of a triple creme with the light tangy qualities imparted by goat`s milk and creme fraiche.  Flavors are bright and clean and luscious, with a very fine, silky texture and delicious, long finish.Minuet pairs well with Champagne or Prosecco."

Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States. Having always been passionate about goats, Laura started her dairy in a former snail-processing plant in Santa Rosa. In 2006 she sold the company to French family cheese producers, Laiteries H. Triballat, who continue the tradition of Laura Chenel’s cheesemaking of both fresh and aged cheese. Milk for production comes from 16 different goat dairies, thirteen of which are in California and three in Nevada. High quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure excellent animal health, nutrition and general well being. Launched in the autumn of 2011, Mélodie is an “American original” made with fresh, pasteurized goat’s milk and named for its black and white rind, reminiscent of piano keys. After cultures and microbial rennet are added to the heated milk, coagulation takes place and the curd is cut and poured into forms to drain. Each 3 lb wheel is flipped several times to achieve optimal drainage before being turned-out and coated in vegetable ash to help promote the formation of the rind. After a few days, a delicate dusting of white mold starts to bloom, creating the signature grey and white rind. The texture of Mélodie is smooth, pliant and supple. The interior paste is bone white in color offset by the delicate, predominantly black and gray rind. Mélodie is delicious when eaten young and, like many soft-ripening cheeses, develops more complex flavors for up to 60-100 days.Flavors are accessibly mild and cream-like, with a gentle lactic tang and a very pleasant balance of salt on the finish.Ideal pairings include almonds and Sauvignon Blanc. For a French twist, pair with Pain d’épices and Champagne."

Moliterno al Tartufo,Central Formaggi,Italy,Sardinia,,11 lbs,www.central.it,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,NaturalFlavored,,,"Produced on the island of Sardinia off the coast of Italy, this is an unforgettably dense and fudgy pecorino laced with thick veins of black truffle. Its story begins in the late 19th century, when Agostino Villecco, an enterprising cheesemaker from southern Italy, moved to the sheep-filled Mediterranean island to satisfy a mainland demand for pecorinos. Using milk from small local shepherds, he began making cheese according to methods from his hometown, and then shipping fresh wheels back to the town of Moliterno for aging and sale. As his sons Carmine and Efisio took up the cheesemaking trade—later passing their business on to Efisio`s sons Jon and Piergiorgio—Central Formaggi developed several versions of the original Moliterno cheese—and this truffle-filled version is one of them. While the modern dairy near Cagliari now turns out 65 different cheeses, Central Formaggi doesn`t compromise on tradition when it comes to Moliterno.Wheels are still made seasonally from December to July. The cultures used to inoculate the milk are homebred. Curds are molded using traditional woven reed baskets, and wheels are aged on wooden shelves, where they cultivate a colorful array of fuzzy molds between weekly washings. While many truffle cheeses are fresh, this one is aged with the special ingredient added, interestingly, after some maturation has already taken place. After traditional wheels of Moliterno age for two months, the most flawless rounds are selected to become Tartufos and enclosed in plastic bags so they stay soft. The paste is infused with freshly ground black truffles during a proprietary injection process, creating the unique zebra stripes whose flavors permeate wheels during additional months of aging; the cheese`s surface is also rubbed with the truffles.When carefully cut open by hand, wheels of Moliterno al Tartufo display a jagged surface reminiscent of a rocky crag. Bite-sized flakes crumble off and melt in the mouth, yielding perfectsavory and creamy harmony, the trufflebalancing the rich earthy notes of the sheep`s milk.Pairings with Moliterno al Tartufo can be challenging. Big, hearty red wines are probably the order of the day, but avoid anything too tannic so as to not overshadow the nuances of the cheese."

During the spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and fed a limited amount of natural grain whilst being milked. Production is also seasonal. To make the cheese, the milk is gently pasteurized before starter cultures and rennet are added. Once the curd is formed and cut, the whey is drained off and the remaining curds put into plastic molds for pressing. After unmolding, the wheels are transferred to a temperature and humidity controlled aging facility at Cedar Grove Cheese in southern Wisconsin.

In production of this fresh chèvre, the milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature in order to retain as much of its character as possible. The curd is also handled very gently to preserve the high moisture and delicate texture of the cheese. The fresh cheese is allowed to drain for 12-16 hours before being formed into discs and decorated with the edible flowers. Head cheesemaker Salud Zavala picks flowers for the cheese from the farm’s garden, which she arranges in the bottom of muffin tins (for small size versions) or in custom-made molds (for larger versions). A layer of fresh cheese is placed over the petals, sprinkled with a layer of Herbes de Provence, then covered with another layer of fresh cheese.Flavors are fresh, milky and sweet with slight vegetal notes, a hint of citrus and a subtle earthiness from the herbs. Texture is fragile and delicate, soft and silky.Pair it with a chardonnay or with a rosé."
Monroe,Emmi Roth,United States,Wisconsin,,1.6 lbs,www.emmiroth.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Rothwades into soft-ripened territory for the first time with this fudgy and luscious stunner. Named for the company’s hometown in Wisconsin, Monroe is hand-smeared with a culture-rich brine and turned daily during over a month of aging, rendering it pink-orange and tacky with an oozing paste. The Roth family cheesemaking venture began in 1865 in Uster, Switzerland, then a small town just outside Zurich. By the end of the century the family decided to bring their expertise in European cheeses to America. By the early 1900s, Otto Roth had established a successful business that soon became one of the largest importers of European specialty cheeses in North America, laying the foundation for what today forms Roth Käse USA.  In 1991, convinced there was a future for making great cheeses in America, Fermo Jaeckle, a former executive with Otto Roth & Co., joined with his cousins, Felix and Ulrich Roth, to further extend their Swiss roots and cheesemaking expertise into the rolling hills of Green County, Wisconsin.  In 2009, Roth Käse USA merged with Emmi Swiss dairy cooperative to form Emmi Roth. Today, Emmi Roth’s expansive portfolio displays a unique marriage of cheeses from two different worlds with very similar traditions and local values: Roth cheeses from Wisconsin and Emmi’s full range of traditional varieties imported from Switzerland.  Known locally as Little Switzerland for its source of high quality milk, Roth’s home of Green County Wisconsin is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. It was in the Green County town of Monroe, this cheese’s namesake, that Roth Käse USA was established, initially with a view towards making authentic Alpine-style cheeses.   After 25 years of producing washed rind cheeses, Roth developed the Monroe cheese to showcase its expertise. For the first two weeks, Monroe is brine-washed in aBrevibacterium linensbrinedaily, then every few days thereafter during a 30-day aging process, which takes place in the Roth cellars.   The cheese is in limited production, as each wheel is hand-smeared, but it`s still made quite an impression on the cheese world; at the 2018 World Cheese Championship, newly-released Monroe secured a bronze medal in its category.This savory stunner yields notes of toasted bread and butter and hints of bright citrus.Monroe’s creamy interior and toasty notes make it well suited to a fruity IPA or a chardonnay."
Mont Briac - Roche Baron,,France,Auvergne,"6 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",1 lb,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Made in the Auverge region of south-central France, Mont Briac is a comparatively recent invention created by Fromagerie de l`Ance under the name Roche Baron, a fairly large producer that also produces St Agur.Made from pasturized milk from the Salers breed of cow, cheeses are coated in ash that gives the cheese its attractive blue gray exterior.Montbriac has a soft, silky, fairly open texture, similar to brie, that is sparsely shot through with pockets of blue mold. The rest of the paste is a pale, cream color and becomes soft and runny with age.Cheeses are matured for about three or four weeks. Flavors are that of a rich (55% butterfat), gentle and creamy blue, with notes of mushrooms, cellar, salt and blue.A very accessible and pleasant cheese that pairs well with an earthy Pinot Noir or Champagne."

Mark, a successful hedge fund manager, saw the farm as an opportunity to spend time with his family in the area where he grew up. He also saw it as a way to pursue a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture compatible with his ideals, combining time-honored French tradition with modern techniques and technology. In 2015, Idyll Farms was poised to become the largest pasture-based goat farm in the country, with a tasting room and tours of the farm soon being offered. Mark is also interested in urban farming projects; he recently brought 30 of his Alpine goats to Brightmoor, a blighted section of Detroit, to graze on the city’s overgrowth. All of Idyll farm’s goat cheeses are made on-premises at the farm. Inspired by traditional French pyramid-shaped Valençay, from the Loire Valley, this cheese is reminiscent of a “mont” on Idyll Farms that offers breathtaking views of the pastures, woodlands and nearby Lake Michigan. Soft ripened and delicately painted with vegetable ash, the pyramids are aged for 12-21 days before sale.With a yeasty, slightly goaty aroma, this cheese has a firm, densely-textured paste and a thin creamline. Taste is creamy with a pleasant tang and notes of fresh wet grass.Pair it with a Chenin Blanc, a dry rosé or a light red such as Gamay. On a cheeseplate, serve it alongside Idyll Farms Cherry Butter, pickled beets or radishes, or clover honey."

The cheese is named after a retreat near Indiana-based Capriole Goat Cheeses that once housed a Franciscan monastery. It`s one ofabout a dozen different goat`s milk cheeses crafted across a wide spectrum of styles at Capriole by Judy Schad. Schad is among the small handful of cheesemakers in the United States who were at the forefront of the farmstead cheese revolution, and she`s vastly contributed to shaping the movement`s future. Schad has been making cheese here since 1976, when she and her husband moved with their three young children from the suburbs to a farm in southern Indiana. They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm, they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great-great-grandfather in the 1870s.When young, the texture of Mont St. Francis is fairly firm and slightly brittle, becoming softer and more supple with age. Flavors are intense, beefy, and earthy, and the cheese has an intensely pungent aroma that is not for the faint-of-heart.Because Mont St. Francis` flavors are quite extreme, it pairs well with bourbon or fruity, fortified wines and sweet condiments. It`s also excellent alongside bitter beers."
Mont Vully (Vully Rouge),Fromagerie Schafer,Switzerland,Fribourg,12 in diameter x 3.5 in height,15 lbs,www.montvullykaese.ch,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,," When cheesemaker Ewald Schafer took over the village dairy in Cressier, Switzerland in 1993, the facility had been producing exclusively Emmentaler for years. But because Emmentaler actually comes from the Emmental region to the East of Fribourg, Ewald didn’t feel that the cheese really belonged in Cressier. He decided to phase out its production and instead create a Swiss original unique to his small dairy. By 1998 he’d stopped making Emmentaler, and production of Mont Vully--known in the U.S. as Vully Rouge--was in full swing. Today he and his family live in the same building as the cheesemaking facility, and they work as cheesemakers together. The cow’s milk for Mont Vully is sourced from an organic farm in Cressier, operated by François Müller and Jean-Pierre Sahli. Milk is delivered to Ewald’s facility each morning at 7:30. First the milk is thermalized in order to eliminate undesirable bacteria, but the temperature is kept low to preserve the ‘good’ bacteria. After cultures and rennet are added, the Schafers wait for the milk to coagulate, then cut the curd using a wire harp. Curds are heated to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and the whey is drained off. After the curds are transferred to hoops, the wheels are marked with the characteristic grape imprint unique to Mont Vully cheeses. Wheels are soaked in brine for 24 hours, and then they’re placed in a cellar to mature at a temperature of 12-16 degrees Celsius for at least 10 weeks. They’re routinely washed with salt brine and with Pinot Noir. Mont Vully is produced and sold in three varieties: ‘Classique’, ‘Bio’, and ‘Réserve’. Classique is the original style, a firm cheese with a mild, pure, and slightly spicy flavor, and an ivory to pale yellow paste. Bio Mont Vully is the organic variety, made according to the strict guidelines of Bio Suisse, the Association of Swiss Organic Farmers. It’s made only using milk from certified organic dairy farms, and it’s rubbed with Pinot Regent organic wine as well as browned organic wheat flour. It’s slightly milder than the Classique variety and has a darker red-brown rind.  The Réserve variety is left to mature for at least 25 weeks—six months longer than the other varieties. It becomes firmer and spicier with age. Pair Mont Vully with a Pinot Noir or a Chardonnay."
MontAmore,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,Varies according to weight,2 lb & 7 oz,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,None,,,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin.Primarily renowned for their production of hard and Italian style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facilities. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible.For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off.The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey. Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation.Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale.Inspiration for Sartori’s MontAmoré comes from the Italian cheese Piave.The resulting flavors contain hints of pineapple and tropical fruits combined with a rich, lactic and creamy tang on the finish.This cheese pairs well with green olives, crusty artisan bread, dried nuts and chocolate.  Good wine matches are Chardonnay, Beaujolais, Pinot Noir and lighter style Italian reds.  Beer pairings such as IPA’s, American Pale Ales, Bocks, Porters and Stouts work well."
Montasio,Various,Italy,"Fruili-Venezia, Veneto","14 ins diameter, 3 ins high",15-20 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Made from semi-skimmed, raw cow’s milk, Montasio is produced in the area of Alpe Guile (Guilian Alps) in the province of Fuili in north-eastern corner of Italy. The origins of this cheese begin in the thirteenth century at an abbey called Moggio. However, due to the popularity of the cheese in the nineteenth century, production spread to the surrounding areas and Montasio is now made in a number of dairies and factories in the region. Montasio was granted full DOC (desingated name) protection in 1986. Montasio is a pressed, cooked cheese, meaning that the curd is “cooked” at a high temperature during production. This results in a greater expulsion of moisture from the curd and makes the cheese suitable for longer aging. Cheeses are generally released at one of three different stages, the earliest being at two months. Partially aged cheeses are sold at four months and Aged cheeses at one year, when they resemble a Piave or Asiago. Young cheeses are quite aromatic and mild, with flavors of grass and fruit and a pliant texture. As the cheeses mature, they gain more depth of flavor, developing notes of butterscotch, salt, and nuts and the texture becomes noticeably firmer. The rind is firm and yellow-gray in color, with occasional dots of red or brown mold. Montasio makes a wonderful table cheese and works well as an accompaniment to pastas or salads. Also, a local delicacy in the Fruili region is “Frico”, a crispy cheese wafer made from aged Montasio. The cheese pairs well with red wines, particularly Barbaresco or Bordeaux."
Montasio Festivo,Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,,5 lbs,www.mozzco.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Hard,Vegetable,Flavored,Alpine-style,Flavor added to rind,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as this Montasio, inspired by the aged Italian classic of the same name. The original, PDO-protected Italian version of this cheese is produced in a mountainous region near Venice. Like the original, this Texan version becomes nuttier in flavor and firmer in texture as it ages for six months. But Paula and her team have spiced up the traditional recipe with added twists such as, in this case, incorporating chili pepper flakes into the rind.With a strikingly rich-colored paste and a dark, chili flake-crusted rind, this cheese firm yet moist and chewy. Flavor is surprisingly subtle; it’s sweet and a bit smoky, with only a hint of lingering ancho chili warmth in the aftertaste.Pair it with an Etude Pinot Noir."
Montcabrer,Formatges Can Pujol,Spain,Cataluña,"6 ins diameter,  2.5 ins high",6 lbs,None,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,,,,"Josep Cuixart, an esteemed Spanish cheesemaker, began Formatges Can Pujol in 1980. With milk from his small herd of goats he produced fresh, ready to eat cheeses at a small factory. However, by 1990, the business had expanded to the point that he was ready to move to a larger location, where the business remained for seven years. Soon after the move, Josep began producing aged cheeses starting with what would become his signature cheeses, Nevat. Now located in the village Vilassar de Dalt, north of Barcelona in Cataluña, Spain, Josep has developed a reputation for excellent cheeses including Nevat and Ros. Formatges Can Pujol still uses the milk from their own herd of goats, but also buy milk from neighboring farmers in their area in order to keep up with demand. MontCabrer is a pasteurized Murciana goat’s milk cheese that is bathed in a mixture of vegetable oil and charcoal. This gives the cheese a rind that is dark grey in color with patches of white mold, making a beautiful contrast against the ivory-white paste.Its recipe is based on the traditional cheese making techniques of Catalonia. Aged for a period of 60 to 90 days, MontCabrer has a semi-firm texture that is rich and soft on the palate. It is full flavored, with notes of earth, sweet milk and a slight tang at the end. Pair this cheese with drier white wines - especially those with citrusy notes. Tempranillo works nicely as well.  MontCabrer pairs beautifully when served with fig and almond or date and almond cake.  It is also lovely when served with Acacia or sunflower honey, or green tomato mostarda."
Monte Enebro,Rafael Baez,Spain,Avila,"10 ins long, 4 ins diameter",2.5 lbs,,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Made in Avila, Spain, by legendary cheesemaker Rafael Baez and his daughter Paloma, Monte Enebro is a goat`s milk cheese made in a large 2lb. log shape from pasteurized milk. Monte Enebro was the first of a wave of new cheeses to be produced in Spain and it has gained a considerable international reputation.The Baezes produce Monte Enebro using penicilium roqueforti, the same mold used to make Roquefort. However, rather than piercing the cheese, which would allow blue veins to develop throughout, the blue mold develops on the rind of the cheese, adding to Monte Enebro`s complex flavors and distinctive appearance.When young, the interior paste of the cheese is pure white and slightly chalky and brittle in texture. With age, the paste tends to break down and become runny and almost translucent just under the rind.Flavors in the younger cheeses are mild, bright and tangy, with distinct citrus notes combined with a cellar-like aroma and flavor imparted by the blue rind. As the cheeses mature, the aromas become more pungent and the flavors evolve and strengthen, becoming quite assertive, tasting of barnyard and goat.Monte Enebro pairs well with Sauternes or a Spanish dessert wine."
Monteo,Casearia Carpenedo,Italy,Veneto,15 in diameter x 11 in height,,www.lacasearia.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,,Alpine-style,,"La Casearia is a creamery and aging facility in the Veneto region of Italy. The history of the company dates back to the early 1900s, when Ernesto Carpenedo began working as a “casoin” (a word in local dialect for a cheesemonger) in a shop in the village of Preganziol. Ernesto eventually founded his own company, which is today run by his son Antonio and his grandsons Ernesto and Alessandro, who have over thirty years of experience in the dairy-cheese sector. Antonio has been devoting his attention to affinage since 1976, the year that he began steeping his first rounds of cheese in wine, giving birth to La Casearia’s signature Ubriaco (which translates into “drunken”).  Monteo is a semi firm cheese produced using milk from farms in the Veneto hills. Its name is the local dialect’s version of ‘Montello,’ the hilly area north of Treviso where La Casearia Carpenedo is located. The region is set upon a mass of red-colored alluvial conglomerations that date back to 60 million years ago, and these rocks can be seen in the cave where the cheese matures for a minimum of two months.Monteo has a light yellow paste displaying eyelets of diverse shapes and sizes. Smell is reminiscent of fresh milk, while flavor is delicate and rounded with lingering notes of butter.Pair it with a Sauvignon Blanc."
Monterey Jack (Face Rock),Face Rock Creamery,United States,Oregon,,40 lb,www.facerockcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,,Microbial,None,,,"Face Rock Creamery is located in Bandon, Oregon, in one of the oldest cheesemaking areas on the west coast. As early as the 1880s, cheese was being made in the many dairy farms in the Coquille Valley to the east of the town, and in 1936 the Bandon Cheese Factory was founded. The son of the factory’s founder, Brad Sinko, took over and ran it until 2003 when it was bought out by a larger competitor. Sinko then spent 10 years as the head cheesemaker Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle and New York. While Sinko was making cheddars in Seattle, the Bandon Cheese Factory was abandoned and torn down by the company that had purchased it. Locals in the town, including developers Greg Drobot and Daniel Graham, were disappointed to see a gravel pit where the Bandon Cheese Factory once stood. Working alongside the community and the City Council, Drobot and Graham decided to rebuild a structure that would host not only a 9,000 sq. foot creamery, but also a 2,000 sq. foot well retail space and cafe. Today cheese is being made in Bandon once again in this location, and Brad Sinko has returned as head cheesemaker. The name ‘Face Rock’ refers to a local monolithic formation on the Oregon coast that resembles a face looking up at the sky. Face Rock sources all of its milk from Scolari’s Dairy Farm in Coquille, only 15 miles from Bandon. The farm has been owned by the same family since the early 1930s, and today has a herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows. Sinko oversees the production of 1,000 pounds of cheese at Face Rock Creamery each day using traditional techniques.  Formed into 40-pound blocks and aged four months in a plastic coating, this is a classic Monterey Jack with a high moisture content, perfect for melting or cooking.Face Rock Creamery’s Monterey Jack has a lactic, yogurt-y scent and a creamy, sticky texture that coats the mouth. Flavor is mild yet round, milky and slightly sweet.This Monterey Jack’s creamy and mild flavor would make a great addition to a burger or a sandwich, perfect as a base for layering up with other flavors. For drink pairings, try it with a dry white wine."

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt (who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University), and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” Moonchego is a cow’s-milk adaptation of the traditional Spanish sheep’s milk cheese Manchego. Matured at least four months, wheels are rubbed with a paste of olive oil and smoked paprika early in the aging period.Aromas are nutty and salty. An initial sweetness gives way to a funky, syrupy combo with the crumbly, aged texture of the cheese. The multiple layers of flavor distinguish themselves, but both have the same lactic, sour face-scrunching effect.Pair Moonchego with a Spanish red such as Tempranillo or Garnacha. Or serve it alongside quince or fig preserves."

With careers as professors within the Wisconsin and Illinois university systems, (Wes as head of Agricultural Science, and Leslie with a strong background in soil science and management) both bring a great deal of experience to farming life. Wes generally takes care of the goats and does the milking, while Leslie oversees the cheesemaking, with help from Alisa, who is Assistant Cheesemaker. The herd of Nubian and La Mancha milking goats currently numbers about 60 within a closed herd system. The milk is of extremely good quality and yields exceptionally high solids. Leslie produces several different varieties of cheese, ranging from a fresh chèvre through to a raw milk blue. Most of her sales take place at Farmers` Markets or go to select retail stores, where invariably demand exceeds supply. The most recent development is that Prairie Fruits Farm is buying a limited quantity of sheep`s milk from a local Amish dairy farmer. To that end, Leslie has started experimenting with several sheep`s milk cheeses that compliment the existing range of goat`s milk cheese. Moonglo is a washed rind Tomme made from raw goat`s milk. It is aged approximately two to three months. The texture of Moonglo is dense and fine with a few holes, or ""eyes,"" and the paste of the cheese is a bone-white color, becoming darker towards the bright orange rind. Flavors are well balanced, with caramel toasty notes as well as a light citrus tang."
Moonlight Chaource,Amazing Real Live Food Company,United States,New York,"5 inches long, 2 inches high",8 oz,www.amazingreallive.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,Ash coated,,,"Located in the town of Pine Plains in the Hudson Valley of New York State, the Amazing Real Live Food Company makes cheese and other products that include pro-biotic bacteria. The company is owned and run by Rory Chase, and long-time friend and business partner, Peter Destler. Both Rory and Peter grew up in Pine Plains, and after years away for school and careers in the food business, they came back to the Hudson Valley to work on Rory’s family dairy farm, Chaseholm Farm Creamery. The farm has been in Rory’s family since the 1930’s when his grandfather founded the dairy. Rory grew up raising prized Holsteins, a practice that he continues today with the herd of 40-50 cows. When Rory took over the family farm in 2007 after reading extensively about cheese-making, taking classes at Cal Poly and the University of Vermont, and interning at a neighboring dairy, he convinced Peter to move back and run the business together. Peter, a CIA trained chef, left his job in Santa Barbara, CA bringing his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, with him. Rory and Peter’s first task was to convert the barn, grain storage rooms, and the old pig sty and a chicken coop into a cheese-making facility, offices and aging rooms. During his time in California, Rory had worked on a lacto-fermentation method of making cheese. This enabled the inclusion of pro-biotic bacteria into the cheese, which according to Rory, also at time enhances the aroma and flavor. Among the cheeses that they produce are Queso Blanco, Herbed Farmer’s Cheeses, Camembert, Moonlight Chaorce, Stella Vallis Tomme, and an aged Gruyere style cheese. Amazing Real Live Food products are only available in the Hudson Valley at local stores, farmer’s markets, restaurants and farm stands. Moonlight Chaorce is an American take on a French classic. It is a cow’s milk cheese aged for 4 to 6 weeks, during which time the ashed exterior develops a soft bloomy white rind.Underneath is a paste that has a succulent, gooey ring around a dense and firm center. The flavor is a balance of butter and tart with a bit of savory in the background.Pair this cheese with crisp white wines or buttery Chardonnays. The best food pairing for Moonlight Chaource are dark berries and honey."
Morbier,Various,France,"Morez, Franche-Comte","12-14 ins diameter, 4 ins high",10-12 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced in the village of Morez in the Jura mountains of France, Morbier dates from the 19th century, when it was traditionally made by the producers of the French cheese, Comte. Initially, Morbier was made for home consumption by the cheesemakers. However, since Morbier took much less time to mature than the massive, 90lb. Comte wheels, cheesemakers could increase their cash flow through selling Morbier.In the evening, after cheesemaking had finished, there would often be a small quantity of curd remaining. A layer of ash (often from burned grape vines) was sprinkled on top to prevent a rind from forming and kept the insects away until the next day when the remaining curd from that day would be placed on top to ""complete"" the cheese.Today the horizontal layer of ash is purely decorative, in deference to original production methods. Production may be fermier, cooperative or industrial and is protected by AOC designation.During production, Morbier is uncooked and pressed, after which wheels are matured for two months. During this time cheeses are washed periodically with salt water. This encourages the development of the rind and is what gives the rind its pink-orange color, pungent aroma and slight stickyness. The shape of a matured wheel of Morbier is that of a large, flat disc with slightly bulging sides.The texture of Morbier is semi soft, supple and springy, with small ""eyes,""` or holes, and the distinctive layer of ash running horizontally thought the center. The color of the paste is a creamy-straw yellow, darkening towards the rind. The rind is edible and often has slightly crunchy granules present.Flavors are much milder than the pungent aroma would indicate, and include hints of fruit, barnyard, grass and citrus.Morbier is excellent served with Gewurztraminer or Pinor Noir."

When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. The herd now numbers around 180 and, thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. Ayrshire milk is particularly well-suited to cheesemaking. In terms of fat and protein, it`s not as high as Jersey or Guernsey but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall and over successive years the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. In addition to the farm and cheesemaking, the brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, which comprise of 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of several other Vermont based producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Harbison, Moses Sleeper and Winnimere.Named after a historic local pioneer scout, Moses Sleeper is similar in flavor to a French Reblochon but with a milder rind.For production, milk is pasteurized and heated to 98.6 F and allowed to ripen via enzymatic process. Once the curds are in the molds, they drain naturally for 18 hours which allows for the maximum retention of moisture in the finished cheese.Despite some pink patches on the exterior rind, Moses Sleeper is not a washed rind cheese. There is some Bacterium Linens present in the original cultures (the same bacteria used for washed rind cheeses) and this is allowed to develop naturally during the course of the 40-60 day maturation period.Moses Sleeper has mild, gentle and savory flavors that taste of milk, hay and butter.  The interior paste is ivory white in color with a semi soft texture dotted with occasional eyes or holes."

The majority of the farm consists of limestone pasture that produces lush grazing interwoven with clover and wild herbs for Mossfield’s herd of eighty five cows, comprised of Friesian and German Rotbunt breeds Mossfield makes a variety of products such as yogurt and bottled milk, but is best known for its cheese. Made broadly in the style of an aged gouda, Mossfield Organic is a cooked, pressed cheese that is sold at either six, nine or twelve months. As well as the plain version, some wheels are produced containing herbs and spices.When young, the aromas and flavors of the plain Mossfield Organic are fresh, lactic and mild.  With age, the texture becomes drier and often crystalline and the cheeses develop a tangy aftertaste with a pronounced nut-like notes.A red wine such as Shiraz.  Also, spiced plum chutney"
Mothais-sur-Feuille,Various,France,Poitou-Charantes,"3-4 inches diameter, 1 inch high",5-6 oz,,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Made in the Poitou-Charentes region of western France, Mothais-sur-Feuille is named for the town of Mothe-Saint-Héray, where the cheese has been made and sold at local markets since the mid nineteenth century. The area has long been famous for goat’s cheese, beginning with the invasion of the Saracens in the Middle Ages who, when they later retreated, left everything behind including their goats and a healthy cheesemaking culture. Although production of the cheese has spread and now extends across a wider region, in 2002 the cheesemakers formed an organization to protect the recipe and to take the first steps towards a name controlled Designation of Origin (AOC). For production, fresh goat’s milk is allowed to stand and slowly coagulate via lactic fermentation. Once formed, the curd is gently scooped into molds to retain as much moisture as possible, and allowed to drain naturally under its own weight. The young cheeses are then wrapped in a leaf - chestnut, sycamore or plane, depending on what is available and transferred to maturing rooms. The maturation of Mothais-sur-Feuille takes place in rooms with unusually high humidity. Whereas most goat’s cheeses age in conditions where humidity is about 85-90%, Mothais-sur-Feuille is kept at nearly 100% humidity for a duration of three to four weeks. During this time, they are turned regularly every 4 days to allow the even distribution of moisture. This, combined with the protective leaf coating, creates a cheese with a relatively high moisture content for its size and maturity – a characteristic that also encourages optimum flavor development. The resulting cheese has a meltingly soft texture when young, becoming more dense as it ages. The paste of the cheese takes on the delicate wood, earth and mold flavors of the leaf and cellar that are subtle in a young cheese but become more concentrated as the cheese matures. The rind is delicate and slightly wrinkled, covered with blue and gray molds underneath the leaf. Mothais-sur-Feuille pairs well with Champagne or with a medium weight single-malt whisky."

Birgit, who is originally from Germany, has a background in Food Science and Robert was the Fermentation Manager at the brewery. In 2000, after some experimental cheesemaking at home, Birgit enlisted the help of her father, Franz, a master cheesemaker from Germany. Today, MouCo Cheese Company produces four types of soft cheese: MouCo Camembert, ColoRouge, Ashley and Truffello. Pasteurized milk, predominantly from Holstein cows, is sourced from Morning Fresh Dairy, located just outside Fort Collins. For production of the Camembert, the milk is heated and the cultures and rennet added. After coagulation, the curd is cut carefully to preserve as much moisture as possible and gently stirred before being transferred into the plastic cheese molds and allowed to drain. After a few hours, the cheeses are unmolded and salted which helps to kick-start the development of the rind. The young cheeses are then transferred to racks and dried slightly before being moved to the maturing cave. During this time, a white mold begins to develop on the exterior of the cheese, until after a period of about two weeks the cheese is ready to be released. At this point, cheeses are wrapped in a special foil, imported from Europe, that allows it to breathe and keeps it in good condition until consumption.The thin, evenly distributed, bloomy white rind contains a meltingly soft cheese within. The texture is smooth and unctuous. Flavors are very clean and milky, with hints of grass and caramel."

Upon Tom`s death in 1998 (aged 100), Ig took over and then finally sold it to David and Cary in 2002, with the stipulation that they would continue to make the creamery’s signature cheeses according to tradition.Today, Rogue Creamery is a thriving business that produces a variety of award winning cheeses in addition to the originals that the Vella family created.Mount Mazama is a cheddar made from a combination of cow`s and goat`s milk. It is wrapped and aged for at least one year in a unique and carefully-controlled environment. Milk for production is sourced from two local dairies, each 25 miles away, in Grants Pass: Rogue View Dairy (cow`s milk) and Rogue River Goat Dairy (goat`s milk). Both dairies are certified in sustainable practices.It has a thick, slightly crumbly texture, with small crystals throughout. There`s a sweet cream flavor and a slight tanginess due to the cow`s milk, and slight acidity along with caramel and nutty notes from the goat`s milk. Mount Mazama would stand out on a cheese board with a range of accompaniments, from chutneys to roasted nuts. Served with a hunk of bread and a spot of beer, this cheese could also be the centerpiece of a delicious lunch. In a sandwich, it could be accompanied by cured ham and spicy mustard. Mount Mazama also pairs well with a sparkling white such as Cremant du Jura or a Southern Oregon Merlot that can balance both texture and richness. "

At an elevation of 2,800ft., the combination of pure water, clean air and deep soils produce an ideal environment for growing diverse, mineral-rich pastures.Rick and Helen Feete have been farming since 1980 and over the years have worked extremely hard, focusing their attention on constantly improving the genetics and milk quality of their herd of Jersey cows.Meadow Creek`s cheese production is resolutely seasonal. Milking begins in late March, when all the calves are born, to coincide with the new growth of grass. The cows are never confined and are born and raised on pasture, where they graze a diverse mixture of perennial grasses and legumes, supplemented with some grains, salt and Norwegian kelp.In the fall, when the grass declines, milk production naturally winds down too. Christmas Eve is the last day of the milking season and the beginning of a two month rest for the cows and the family.Although Rick and Helen have been making Mountaineer since their second year of cheesemaking, this cheese truly came into its own after a trip to Europe in 2004.While there, they had the chance to taste some of the great Alpine cheeses of Valle d`Aosta and the Savoie, as well as tour some of the European cheese aging facilities. This experience crystallized their vision of what Mountaineer should be: a dense, complex cheese matured in the traditional European style, but reflecting their mountainous Virginian surroundings.Made from the milk of one milking, Mountaineer is a firm cheese with a hard rind that is washed regularly during the six month aging process.The texture is smooth and supple with occasional small eyes (holes). At an age of about six months, Mountaineer develops a complex flavor, predominately toasty, nutty and sweet with hints of butterscotch.Excellent with figs or toasted hazelnuts, Mountaineer also pairs well with a Viognier or apple and pear ciders."

The duo—who founded the Accident, Maryland-based goat cheese creamery in 2002—originally set out to make a pyramid-shaped cheese with an external blue rind.They inoculated the pyramids with spores for blue mold Penicillium roqueforti, but the young cheeses` proximity to a brie-style disc during its three weeks of aging quickly resulted in cross-contamination with Penicillium candidum mold.MountainTop became unexpectedly white and fluffy, with just a hint of blue—but Solanet and Kochloved the result, so they decided to enter it into the American Cheese Society Competition. It won a ribbon, and the rest was history. While the blue is barely detectable in the white rind of this mold-ripened pyramid, its tiny hint of sharpness is a lovely complement to the cheese`s bright flavors of grass and milk.Pair MountainTop Bleu with a rosé, a riesling, or a sauvignon blanc."

In 1977 the original ""Joe"" sold the store and dairy to seventeen year old Anthony Campenelli, who literally lived next door. It had been Anthony`s dream to own the business and he, together with his brother Vincent and other members of the family, still operate it. The base mozzarella curd is sourced from Buffalo, New York and processed in the tiny room behind the store front. Mozzarella is made throughout the day and sold almost as rapidly as they are made. A proportion of the cheeses are set aside for smoking, which also happens on site. For production, the base slabs of mozzarella curd are first shredded by hand before being transferred to a very large stockpot-type pan on the stove. Hot water is added to soften the curd which then knits together as one very stretchy unit. At this point, the curd needs to be continually worked and stretched, chunks being broken off and placed in an open mold to ""cure"". After a few minutes, they are removed, worked and stretched again, this time with smaller balls being broken off. The stretching of the curd is skilled work, essential to producing the delicate layered texture of the cheese while retaining the moisture. Finally the balls are allowed to soak in water or a light brine solution. The mozzarella that`s set aside for smoking is briefly drained before being placed in the smoker. The smoking process takes place over hickory wood and lasts a mere four minutes. Joe’s Dairy Fresh Mozzarella is wonderfully milky tasting with a moist, light, slightly fluffy texture. The smoked version has a pale brown interior encasing a bright white paste. The texture of the smoked cheese is a little more dense than the fresh balls and has a delicate flavor of campfire smoke near the outside that doesn’t overwhelm the lactic and gently salty notes. For best effect, eat on day of purchase at room temperature."
Mozzarella - Smoked (Maplebrook Farm),Maplebrook Farm,United States,Vermont,,8 or 16 oz,www.maplebrookvt.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,Smoked,,,"Maplebrook Farm was founded in 2003 after a chance encounter. Founder, Johann Englert, came across Al Ducci`s Groceria in Manchester, Vermont during a visit and when she tasted their mozzarella, it transported her back to her time in Italy during college. Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lives. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today, Maplebrook Farm is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. It employs around 20 cheesemakers, who are each trained in old world cheesemaking techniques. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Mike still is the head cheesemaker for the majority of their cheeses, but as of 2010 now has help from Domenico Marchitelli, who makes the Burrata and Scamorza. Domenico hails from Puglia, Italy, the birthplace of Burrata. Maplebrook’s Smoked Mozzarella made daily by hand. The mozzarella is produced by “stretching” cow’s milk curd into small balls. Stretching is a technique where the curd is kneaded and pulled until it is a like a dense dough. Once the balls of cheese are formed, they are briefly set into a salt-water solution, which helps the cheese develop its flavor. After soaking, the cheese is transferred to a smoker and smoked over Cherry wood chips for2 ½ hours. The resulting cheese has a light flavor and no rind.Smoked Mozzarella works very well with roasted vegetables such as eggplant and squash. It can also be added to meatless dishes that need a smoky, savory punch. Depending on the dish, the cheese can pair very nicely with an off-dry white wine such as Gewürztraminer or Riesling. It can also pair nicely with a deep red wine such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah."
Mozzarella - Smoked (The Mozzarella Company),The Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,"3 ins diameter, 2 ins high",8oz,www.mozzco.com,Cow,,Soft,Microbial,Smoked,,,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, one of which is Smoked Mozzarella. Paula’s inspiration for the creation of her Smoked Mozzarella stems from her love of Italian cheeses and also her frustration at not being able to find Fresh Mozzarella in Dallas during the 1980’s. Determined to put this right, Paula spent time at a small cheese factory near Perugia where she learned to make fresh mozzarella. Upon returning to Dallas, she wanted to add to her line of cheeses and subsequently developed her Smoked Mozzarella. Cow’s milk for production comes from a number of family farms located southwest of Dallas, TX, near the towns of Cleburne and Stephenville. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized. To make the Mozzarella, selected bacteria known as starter cultures, are added to the milk along with a microbial rennet which acts as a coagulant. Once coagulated, the curd is cut both horizontally and vertically by hand with cheese knives, forming the curds into small soft cubes and releasing a quantity of excess whey. The curds are allowed to “rest”in the whey until they reach the correct texture. At this point, hot water is poured over them and the curds are stretched and worked with a small paddle until they become malleable, smooth and satin-like in texture. This is the most crucial and skilled part of the cheesemaking process for Mozzarella because there’s only a small window of opportunity to stretch the curd. If the curd is worked before the pH level reaches 5.2, it becomes tough and inferior. However, if the pH falls too low the curd is not able to be formed into cheese. Assuming all goes well, 8oz balls of mozzarella are pinched off from the stretched curd and immediately tossed into cool water to chill down. One chilled, they are briefly placed into a brine solution. At this point, selected cheeses are taken off to be smoked over smoldering pecan shells. As well as imparting a true Southern nuance, the Pecan Tree is the state tree of Texas, which makes it particularly appropriate. Flavors of the Mozzarella Company’s Smoked Mozzarella are very rich and cream-like with a balanced, with gentle caramel and smoke aromas and a clean bright finish."

It wasn`t until the 1700`s that Mozzarella di Bufala started to gain popularity, by which time the formerly wild buffalo had become thoroughly domesticated.Mozzarella di Bufala belongs to the ""pasta filata"" family of cheeses, which refers to the process whereby the curds are heated to a point where they can be stretched and formed into balls or other shapes. The stretching action, essentially, creates multiple layers of curd that trap moisture within them. This gives Mozzarella its very sweet, milky, fresh taste that has a hint of sourness about it. The texture is very soft and moist and can be slightly granular.Rather than claim to have mountains of flavor, Mozzarella is designed to be a perfect vehicle and foil for other ingredients, especially in cooking when its melting qualities come to the fore.Best eaten as fresh as possible"

The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Made from the milk of Water Buffalo raised on small farms on the border of the National Park of Cilento, this fresh cheese is hand-pulled and shaped into the traditional spherical shape as well as various other forms such as braided ropes. The aroma is of fresh milk and cream. Its texture is smooth with a snap when bitten into. Like all the best Mozzarella di Bufala, it has a clean, milky flavor. Since it is a DOP cheese, Casa Madaio’s version of Mozzarella di Bufala must be made with animal rennet. In order to conform to U.S. laws, the version in the United States is made using pasteurized milk. However, if you are able to taste the cheese in Italy, it will be made using raw milk. There are no less than eight different sizes of the Mozzarella produced by Casa Madaio, they range in weight from 30 grams (1 oz) for the “ciliegine” sized cheese to 1 kg (2.3 lbs) for “la zizza di Battipaglia” sized cheese.Mozzarella di Bufala always pairs beautifully with fresh tomatoes with salt and pepper sprinkled on top, basil leaves and some fruity olive oil.   Another traditional use is to serve it sliced with Prosciutto di Parma and fresh melon, or in baked dishes such as Eggplant Parmigiana. When served fresh, a light white wine such as Pinot Grigio is the best pairing. If used in rich baked dishes, a bold red wine such as a Super Tuscan is ideal."

Ms Natural,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,Northern California,3 ins diameter.  1 inch high,4 oz,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,None,,,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Cypress Grove produces a variety of fresh, flavored chevres, each of which have their own distinct identity and name, mirroring the ingredients used as well as the company’s play on words. For production, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are then added. The mixture is moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt and formed into disks. Herbs and other flavorings are added by hand. The disks are then vacuum sealed, labeled and sent directly to market without aging. Cypress Grove’s Fresh Chevre is available in several varieties; Ms Natural, Purple Haze, Herbs de Humboldt, Sgt Pepper and PsycheDillic that known collectively as the Flashback Family of Chevre. Ms. Natural is the cheese that provides the base for the other flavored versions and as such, is presented without the addition of any flavors.Cheeses have a smooth, moist texture and clean, delicate citrus notes rounded off with a pleasantly balanced tang."

Muffato,Moro Formaggi,Italy,Veneto,12 in diameter x 3 in height,20 lbs,moroformaggi.it,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Flavor AddedHerbed,Blue,Flavor added to rind," Moro Formaggi was founded in 1930, when Luigi Moro established a milk collection center in the town of Oderzo, Italy. Following World War II, Moro expanded the collection center into a cheese factory and shop. Decades later, in the 1980s, Luigi’s grandson Sergio Moro expanded the family business to include an aging facility. Today Sergio is known for adding inventive flavors and ingredients to the rinds of his cheeses, from Prosecco to lapsang souchong tea to hay.   Muffato, a blue cow’s milk cheese dressed in aromatic plants, is no exception. Young wheels are left to mature for a few weeks in a cool, humid cave before they’re covered in herbs and flowers (depending on the season, wheels might yield a mix of chamomile, marjoram, verbena, mint, or thyme). After being coated, the wheels age an additional three months. This squat, herb-green wheel has a creamy beige paste and modest blue veining. Flavor is sweet and balanced with herbaceous notes from the rind and spicy hints from the blue. Muffato is perfect for a dessert course; pair it with something sweet like a rich pear or cherry jam, and a dessert wine like Sauternes. "
Munster,Various,France,"Alsace, Lorraine, Franche-Comté","5-7.5 ins diameter, 1-3 ins height",1-3 lbs,,Cow,PasteurisedRaw,Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Today one of France`s most famed washed-rind cheeses, Munster had humble beginnings in the Middle Age monasteries surrounding the Vosges Mountains of France`s Alsace, Lorraine, and Franche Comté regions near the border with Germany. Formerly known as Munster only on the Alsace side of the mountains, and Géromé on the Lorraine side, the two cheeses were united in 1978 under a protected AOC (now a European PDO) for Munster and Munster-Géromé. Milk traditionally comes from Vosgiennes cows, a breed that was imported from Scandanavia in the 18th century and is known for the high protein content of its milk. The cheeses come in either pasteurized or raw versions, and production can be fermier (farmstead), coopérative, or industriel (industrial).During the summer, some of the best versions are made from the milk of cows grazing on high mountain pastures. During the winter, the animals are moved closer to the farm and although the cheese can still be excellent, it tends to have slightly different characteristics. PDO regulations dictate that all cheeses must be matured within a designated area and that the minimum time for aging is three weeks before release, although ten weeks is more common. (In the case of the mini version, Petit Munster, the minimum time is two weeks.) Rind and aroma are the keys to Munster`s maturity. Young cheeses have a pale rind that is pinkish-white in color, soft, but relatively dry and not overly pungent. As the cheeses age and receive their regular brine washes, the rind is transformed to a rich, red-orange color with a distinctly sticky (but not slimy) surface and an assertive, pungent smell that—love it or loathe it—cannot be ignored.When young, the texture of a ripe Munster is pale cream in color, firm (yet smooth) and slightly brittle. With age, the bacterial activity of the rind transforms the texture into a luscious, soft, meltingly unctuous paste and the color darkens slightly.Flavors are very rich, smooth, and slightly tangy on the finish.Munster pairs well with crisp Alsatian whites or dessert wines."
Mycella,Denmark's Tradition,Denmark,Bornholm,"7.5 inch diameter, 2 inches tall",3 lbs,,Cow,,Blue,Microbial,None,,,"Denmark has a long tradition of dairying and cheesemaking. Its temperate climate and low-elevation, flat landscape ensure large areas of rich pasture land, ideal for grazing cows and other livestock. However, with technological advances over the last sixty years, this same set of circumstances, coupled with the country’s proximity to large European centers of population have seen a strong trend towards the industrialization of Danish dairying and cheese production most of which buy their milk from large numbers of co-operative dairies. Its an efficient system, but one that has unfortunately resulted in the extinction of most artisanal cheesemaking facilities. Until recently, that is. Within the last decade, a handful of producers, some of which are quite large, have turned their attention to re-creating original Danish cheeses made in a traditional way – and on a relatively small scale. One such company is Denmark’s Tradition. Established in 2010 specifically with a view to renewing some of the classic Danish cheeses, the company works with just two dairy farms that supply the milk. Denmark’s Tradition produces Mycella, a pasteurized cow’s milk blue cheese made on the 600 sq kilometer island of Bornholm, located in the Baltic Sea, east of mainland Denmark and to the south of Sweden. For production of Mycella, curds are gravity-drained into molds and pressed, before being pierced to allow air into the cheese and the subsequent development of blue veins. Wheels are aged for six months the in caves below the creamery prior to release and any surface mold is washed off before packing and shipping.The ideal flavor profile of Mycella is sweeter and more cream-like than that of many blue cheeses. A clean white rind encases an ivory white interior paste shot through with blue veins studded with crystalized nuggets of amino acids.  Mycella is rich and mildly salty, with occasional cherry and smoky notes.  Ideal for salads."

After life took Tom`s career in a different direction for a number of years, the Clarks did, in fact, end up raising that flock when they built Old Chatham. The couple was involved in every aspect of the company, from the design of the barns to cheesemaking to working to maintain the property. In 2014, Dave and Sally Galton purchased the company from Tom and Nancy, and today continue to produce its line of cheeses and yogurts.For several years the Old Chatham has been sourcing its milk from the Galton family farm, Shepherd`s Way, which keeps a flock of 2,100 ewes. Named after the company`s co-owner, Nancy`s Camembert is a meltingly creamy, soft ripened cheese, made from a blend of sheep`s milk, cow`s milk, and cow`s cream. When young, the texture is semi-soft in the center of the cheese, becoming smoother and softer just under the rind. The rind can be quite dense and slightly chewy. As the cheese matures, the texture becomes quite runny under the rind, while the center retains its cohesiveness.Nancy`s Camembert has a very smooth and buttery flavor, almost like a very rich ice cream. Notes of hay, grass and savory vegetal flavors are present.This cheese pairs very well with Champagne, since the effervescence cuts through the richness of the cheese."
Nevat / Petit Nevat,Josep Cuixart,Spain,Catalonia,Varies,5 lbs & 8oz,,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,,,"Josep Cuixart, an esteemed Spanish cheesemaker, began Formatges Can Pujol in 1980. With milk from his small herd of goats he produced fresh, ready to eat cheeses at a small factory. However, by 1990, the business had expanded to the point that he was ready to move to a larger location, where the business remained for seven years. Soon after the move, Josep began producing aged cheeses starting with what would become his signature cheeses, Nevat. Now located in the village Vilassar de Dalt, north of Barcelona in Cataluña, Spain, Josep has developed a reputation for excellent cheeses including Nevat and Ros. Formatges Can Pujol still uses the milk from their own herd of goats, but also buy milk from neighboring farmers in their area in order to keep up with demand. Nevat is produced using the milk of Murcia and Grenadine goats that browse the classic Mediterranean, scrubby vegetation in the region of Vilassar de Dalt (15kms. north of Barcelona) near the sea coast. Their milk is particularly high in fat and consequently has the capacity to retain the flavors of thyme, rosemary and olive that comprise a large part of the goats` diet. These flavors then transfer into the cheese, even though the milk is pasteurized. The name ""Nevat"" translates to ""snowy"" in Catalan, and makes reference to the white, bloomy mold that develops on the surface rind of the cheese. Larger cheeses have a distinctive shape, which is that of a peaked mountain. This is due to the production process, when the curds are scooped up in a square of cheesecloth and left to drain. As the curds dry, they take on the imprint and shape of the cloth, which remains after they are turned out. Smaller versions of Nevat are made in a small disc shape. In mature cheeses the interior paste and texture of Nevat will remain bone-white and become soft, verging on runny, towards the rind, while remaining fairly firm in the center - especially with the large format. The rind occasionally picks up gray, or slightly red sticky patches which, again, is a sign of age. Younger cheeses are just as white (usually minus the patches) and have a more uniform firm texture.Flavors are clean, milky and bright, with a citrus tang and an underlying sweetness that makes this cheese very accessible.  Slight hints of salt balance everything out and give the cheese a pleasingly long finish."

Together with his friend Day, Trail began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After two years O`Connell decided to pursue other interests and Trail and Day assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing marketing and sales. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsula’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Created with a view to being an accessible “everyday” cheese, New Moon has developed a considerable local following. The cheese is made using a rennet based production and a cooked curd process. After pasteurization, the milk is cultured and rennet added to coagulate the milk. The curd is cut and stirred and then heated again to a higher temperature in order to expel additional moisture. At this stage the whey is drained off and the remaining curd is salted, transferred into molds and pressed overnight. The following morning, the young cheeses are unmolded and transferred to a maturing room where they remain for between one to three weeks before release. The cheese has little or no rind formation but the indentations of the cheese cloth are evident in the pale ivory-colored surface.The texture of New Moon is smooth, dense and semi-soft. Flavors are rich and mild, tasting of cultured butter with a pleasantly sour note on the finish."

There are a few reasons for the unique moniker: the cave’s storied past as the subject of many local legends near Sequatchie Cove Farm (Johnny Cash supposedly had a spiritual awakening in it), “plus, it just has a great ring to it!” says Sequatchie co-owner Padgett Arnold. Nickajack is also the name of a rare southern apple variety, a nod to the cider washing process that the wheels undergo during aging. Sequatchie Cove itself is a diversified farm of 300 acres set in the shade of the Cumberland Plateau outside Chattanooga, Tennessee. Under the direction of Bill and Miriam Keener and family, the farm includes a plant nursery and berry patch, as well as extensive pasture for the production of dairy, beef, lamb and pork. Animals graze year-round on the pasture, and no pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones are used. Raw milk for cheese production is sourced exclusively from Sequatchie Cove’s diverse herd of dairy cows. During at least 60 days of aging, Nickajack is washed in Michigan-made JK Scrumpy’s hard cider. Scrumpy’s is chosen because of its aromatic quality and organic production methods, but in the future, Arnold says, Sequatchie hopes to develop and use its own hard cider made from local apples.The repeated cider washing turns the rind a golden-tan to orange-red color while helping wheels to retain a moist and supple paste. Aroma is approachable for a washed rind, with fruity hints and a dairy-forward flavor, yielding salt around the edges and ending with an earthy, musky finish deep in the gullet.Nickajack pairs nicely with a hard cider, of course—go for something on the sweeter side. Brown and amber ales also pair well, while the best food pairingsinclude maple bacon and mustards."

Awarded Portugese DOP (name protected) status, Nisa is a firm-textured cheese made from raw sheep’s milk cheese. Milk is predominently sourced from the Saloio breed of sheep, which are related to the Merina Branca (or Merino), breeds both known for their high quality milk. Nisa is produced by several (approximately 23) small-scale local creameries and farmhouses together with a handful of small industrial enterprises. For production, milk is coagulated using thistle rennet. This is a natural vegetable rennet derived from the stamens of the cardoon thistle, which naturally grows wild in the countryside where the cheese is made. After coagulation, the curd is cut and the whey slowly drained off before being placed into cheese molds for pressing. After unmolding, the cheeses are dry salted and transferred to maturing rooms where they’re aged for a minimum of 45 days, divided into three distinct phases, and rubbed with a brine solution at regular intervals to give the cheeses a smoother texture. The exterior rind is firm and orange-brown in color whilst the interior paste is ivory-white, dense and firm,with small “eyes” or holes. Compared to many other cheeses made using thistle rennet, which often have a sour note, the flavors of Nisa are slightly sweet and cream-like, with notes of walnuts.

After the cheese strings are formed, they are twisted by hand into a variety of different-size “braids”.Oaxaca melts wonderfully and can be used in pizza, nachos, or quesadillas. It’s also fun to just pull the braid apart and eat it fresh. The cheese is available in both plain and caraway seed versions. "

They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great, great grandfather in the 1870s. Over the years, the suburbs have followed them and they are now the last working dairy in the county.Judy wanted to build a working model that others could follow, but since there were no guidelines for commercial goat dairying, they based their model, through trial and error, on an older, more traditional dairy, centered on herd health, longevity, productivity and on animals who are born, live, and die on the same farm. Judy`s goats comprise of Alpine, Saanen and Nubian breeds.Judy produces about a dozen different goat`s milk cheeses across a wide spectrum of styles.First produced in 1988, O`Banon was one of the first cheeses in the Capriole line.The inspiration for this cheese comes from the Banon goat`s milk cheese that has been made for centuries in the Haute Provence and wrapped in chestnut leaves. The French cheese is smaller and allowed to ripen within its leaves, which are traditionally soaked in local eau de vie. Judy`s version is larger and she soaks the leaves in Kentucky Woodford Bourbon prior vacuum packing the cheeses at a fairly young age. This preserves moisture and gives the cheeses a fresher, lighter taste and helps retain the bourbon flavor to better effect.The texture of the O`Banon is moist, delicate and silky. The interior paste is bone-white, tending towards brown on the rind where the leaves have been in contact with the cheese.Flavors are aromatic due to the bourbon, but at the same time present clean, brigh,t citrus notes that underpin the delicate balance and sweetness of the goat`s milk."

They own 76 acres of land, 30 of which are allocated to grazing for their 116 Lacaune and East Friesian dairy sheep.Brenda and Dean started with a small dairy herd and have both worked hard to improve genetics and milk quality. Friesians produce a good yield of milk and have very calm temperaments, while Lacaunes bring higher fat and protein into the mix.The vision for Hidden Springs Farm and Creamery is to be sustainable - both environmentally and financially. Since the Jensens are in the middle of Amish farm country (Dean works as a councillor for the Amish community), they appreciate Amish values and work practices. They employ Amish friends and neighbors for milking and construction. Percheron draft horses -- not tractors -- plow their fields, and donkeys keep coyotes and other predators away from their lambs.Brenda has been working to develop several cheeses, and Driftless was her first cheese. She has since added an aged cheese, O`Cooch Mountain, well as Feta and a semi-aged cheese called Bad Axe to the range.Named after a local landmark, O`Cooch Mountain is a small, natural rinded wheel weighing approximately 2lbs. The interior is straw-colored, with a smooth, supple paste when young, becoming firmer with age.Flavors of O`Cooch show the sweetness of the sheep`s milk but with age can become quite assertive. In addition to flavors of milk and grass and caramel, the cheese tends towards notes reminiscent of leather and woodsmoke."

Founded in 2005 by Matt Day and Ryan Trail, Mt Townsend Creamery is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Port Townsend, Washington.Inspired by the Olympic Peninsula’s rich dairy history, the duo produces a variety of cheeses from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a dairy located 30 miles from the creamery, which delivers milk directly. To make Off Kilter, Mt Townsend cheesemakers pasteurize and coagulate the milk, cut it into curds, and then heat and stir the curds before they`re transferred to cheese molds to drain. After unmolding, the young cheeses are brined and then transferred to a drying room where they’re left overnight. They are then moved to an aging room where they remain for a few weeks, washed regularly with a solution of Scotch ale.Off Kilter has a semi-soft texture, dotted with small “eyes” or holes, remeniscent of a French-style tomme. The interior paste is a pale straw color while the exterior rind is a delicate pale pink-beige. Flavors and the aroma are gently earthy, lactic and barnyardy, with a slight tang on the finish.Pair it with the beer it`s washed in: Kilt Lifter from Pike Brewing Company."

The first wheels of Oka were made in 1893, and were largely inspired by the monastic cheese Port Salut from France. In the late 1800s, monks from this same order established a monastery at La Trappe, near the village of Oka in Quebec. They brought the Port Salut recipe with them and recreated their own cheese at the new monastery, where the tradition continues today. Production of Oka is now undertaken by a commercial company, the monks having sold the rights in 1996. Cheeses can be made from either pasteurized or raw milk. It is still made according to a traditional monastic washed rind cheese recipe, in that it`s pressed, semisoft in texture and is washed with a brine solution to encourage the development of the rind while it ages. Maturation takes place for a minimum of one month, while The `Classic` version is ripened for two.The texture of Oka is semisoft, pliable, smooth and homogenous. The paste ranges in color from ivory to straw, the rind being closer to the classic reddish-orange of most washed rind cheeses.In terms of flavor, ""Regular"" Oka lacks the deep, penetrating flavors of the longer ripened, ""Classic"" Oka. Both cheeses are delicate and subtle, with a fresh but rounded lactic tang; with hints of butter and toast. Flavors intensify with age.Sip a Burgundy red or a zinfandel alongside this classic Canadian washed-rind."

Having apprenticed at Peaked Mountain Farm in Townsend, Vermont, Michael manages the herd of about 35 milking does, made up mostly of Alpine with a few Nubian and Saanens mixed in, and produces and ages the cheese all by hand. Emily manages the business and marketing for Twig Farm while simultaneously working as an analyst for a publishing firm. Michael and Emily intentionally keep their business small, with the focus on the cheesemaking process and a respect for their animals. All the goats on Twig Farm are pasture fed and are allowed to roam on the property both day and night. They feed on buckthorn, goldenrod, and dandelion among other species, which produces milk that has a distinct herbaceous quality. Old Goat is a twist on Twig Farm’s Goat Tomme. It is much larger than the original cheese, which weighs about 2 lbs versus the 5 to 10 lbs of Old Goat. Also, this cheese is aged for a longer period of time, 10 to 12 months versus around 3 for the Tomme. The differences in size and aging ensure that Old Goat has a character all its own. It is a firm cheese with an ivory colored paste and a light brown rind covered in a layer of white molds.The interior of the cheese has a smooth texture that can be slightly crumbly or flaky. Its flavor is of sweet, nutty caramel with a bit of salt. Old Goat is only available in limited quantities at local Middlebury Farmer’s Market. At times, the cheesemakers will turn some wheels into a subtly blue cheese called Blue Goats.This cheese is best paired with a crisp white wine or a dry hard cider. Serve Old Goat with apples and/or goat milk caramel for a fun twist."

Willem and Meja are now buying in their milk from a neighboring farm.Milk for cheesemaking is heat-treated rather than pasteurized, thereby keeping some of the original flavors of the milk.They make a Gouda-style cheese called Growler using traditional Dutch gouda mold, or forms know as cadova molds. These give the cheese their distinctive shape.The regular Growlers are aged for a minum of two months and often slightly longer. If cheeses show the right characteristics for further aging they may be held for longer maturation and become Old Growlers.Characteristics of the Growler are warm, buttery flavors and a distinctive tang and lengthy finish. The rind is a classic, buttery yellow and coated in Plasticoat that protects the cheese while aging, but allows it to breathe at the same time - a crucial component for maturing a natural rinded cheese."

His parents transitioned to organic production with their predominately Jersey herd, while Sebastian went a step further by diversifying into cheese production. Named after Sebastian`s grandmother, Erika von Trapp, who settled the farm with her husband Werner, Oma is a washed rind tomme style cheese that is aged for between 2-3 months. Although not specifically based on another cheese recipe, the style of Oma is immediately familiar. Sebastian learned to make cheese by working at Jasper Hill Farm and also spent time with Neal`s Yard Dairy in preparation for his new pursuit. Production of the cheese utilizes raw milk from the von Trapp`s herd of cows. Finished cheeses are transferred at a young age to the Cellars at Jasper Hill where they are matured for a further 2-3 months prior to release. The interior paste of Oma is semi soft and golden in color - typical of the Jersey milk used for production. The brown orange rind is thin yet dense, with a light dusting of white mold. There are impressions on the rind from the cheese forms used during draining. Flavors are mild and buttery with an earthy aroma reminiscent of French Reblochon.

Organic Champlain Triple,Champlain Valley Creamery,United States,Vermont,"2 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",4 oz,www.cvcream.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,,,"Based in Vermont’s Champlain Valley, cheesemaker Carleton Yoder originally moved to the area with a degree in Food Science and a view to making hard cider. His interest in all things food and fermented eventually led him to work as an assistant cheesemaker at Shelburne Farms. There, his interest in the dairy world was ignited and after about a year, Yoder decided to set up his own business, founding Champlain Valley Creamery in 2003. Cow’s milk for production comes from Journey’s Hope Farm, a certified organic producer near Bridport on the shored of Lake Champlain. The herd are a mix of crossbred Jerseys and Holsteins, yielding milk that is an ideal cheesemaking blend of butterfat and solids. Having started by producing a handmade cream cheese, in 2005 Yoder decided to experiment with a triple cream. He took them to the farmers market where they sold out really quickly. He now makes 350 cheese per batch, up to four times each week. As its name suggests, Organic Champlain Triple is a triple cream cheese, meaning that cream has been added to whole milk resulting in a rich tasting and high butterfat cheese. After the milk is heated and coagulated, the curd is gently ladled by hand into small crottin forms. (Crottin forms traditionally come from France where they are used to produce small format cheeses such as Crottin and Chabis.) Yoder uses a combination of Penicilium Candidum and Geotricum mold spores that are part of the blend since he feels they introduce some complexity to the flavor of the finished cheese. The curd is allowed to drain under its own weight to expel excess whey since this allows for the maximum retention of moisture. The cheeses are then unmolded and transferred to maturing rooms where they remain for approximately twelve days prior to release.Since the Organic Champlain Triple is sold at a young age, the texture is relatively firm and chalky at the time of release, becoming softer as the cheese ages.  Aromas and flavors are rich, earthy and mushroom-like with a pleasant, clean lactic finish."

Made only with raw farmstead milk and aged for three and a half months, Original Blue is a perennial favorite, winning repeated awards since its launch in 2000. This blue cheese makes up 65 percent of the sales at the company, which was founded in 1959 by Bob Giacomini, a descendant of Italian mountain dairy producers.Over the years, Bob and his wife Dean, together with their four daughters, Karen, Diana, Lynn and Jill, developed a shared vision of producing an all-natural farmstead cheese. This dream was realized in August, 2000, when they founded Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company and produced the first vat of Original Blue. Milk comes from the Giacominis` own closed herd of Holstein cows that grazes the pastures overlooking Tomales Bay. Production begins at 3:30 a.m. when milk is pumped to the make room in time for the morning`s cheesemaking. After production takes place, the cheeses are allowed to sit in their forms overnight. The following day cheeses are unmolded and hand-salted over a three day period before being pierced on the fourth day. They are then taken to the curing room for about three weeks where they are cradled in a vertical position on racks, each one rotated a quarter turn each day. This ensures that the butterfat is evenly distributed throughout the cheese. The piercing of the cheeses with stainless steel needles allows the air into the cheese, where it reacts with the enzymes and bacteria and causes the development of the blue veining. Finally, cheeses are transferred into the aging room where they are left to mature.Original Blue has a semi-soft, very creamy texture containing multiple blue veins. Flavors are balanced, with definite hints of butter, hay, sea salt and butterscotch.We love Original Blue alongside Pomegranate Jelly from jam purveyor PEJU."
Oriol de Montbrú,Formatges Montbrú,Spain,Catalonia,,3 lbs,www.montbru.com,Buffalo,Pasteurised,Firm,,Natural,,,"“There was this guy selling buffalo cheese, and I was like, what?” recalls importer Michele Buster of the first time she tried Suau de Búfala on a sunny morning at a little market in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol. “It was so creamy, lactic, and fantastic. It stopped me in my tracks.”   That one taste launched the importer on a feverish search for the standout wheel—a journey that would lead her 370 miles away to a hillside farm near the Catalan village of Moià, to meet cheesemaker Oriol Antúnez.  Antúnez lives on his family farm in Catalonia, where his parents, Pere Antúnez and Inmaculada Llonch, began raising goats in the mid-1980s and experimenting with cheesemaking in their kitchen. Eventually the couple built a small production facility in their old stone home, in a cavernous room carved into a hillside that once housed the cistern. Six years ago, the family moved production to a much larger, modern facility on the outskirts of Moiàl—and Oriol began expanding the product line, driven by a desire to experiment with new styles.   Oriol began buying buffalo milk in 2010 from an Italian farmer Lluís Mont, who had settled in the grassy Aiguamolls de l’Empordà Natural Park nearby. He developed the recipe for an unpressed pasteurized-milk wheel in 2011, which sprouted a blue-gray rind similar to that of traditional Catalan garrotxa as it aged four to five months. Due to its smoothness, or suau in Catalan, he named it Suau de Bufala.   After Buster found Antúnez, she teamed up with the maker to adjust the recipe so that the cheese could withstand a transatlantic journey. Antúnez added an extra step to the recipe: Now he presses newly formed rounds to eliminate extra moisture, resulting in a drier, hardier cheese. He also increased wheel size from two to three pounds, which slows aging and preserves creaminess. Finally, sensing that “suau” isn’t the easiest word for Americans to pronounce, Buster renamed the cheese after its inventor. Boasting a musty blue-gray rind surrounding a lovely cream line that encases a dense, bone-white paste, the wheel is absolutely striking. Initial aromas include unsalted butter, stone cellar, and pebbles pulled from a stream, while flavor builds slowly—lactic, yogurt-fresh, and slightly tangy, with hints of peas and edamame—then lingers. Seek out fruity, piquant, and acidic accompaniments to balance Oriol de Montbrú’s milky voluptuousness: Spanish quince paste (membrillo), sweet-tart blood-orange preserves, and strawberry-balsamic compote all fit the bill. Off the cheese plate, “there are really cool things you can do with Oriol,” Buster says. “It’s wonderful shaved into a salad, or you can bread it and fry it—I’ve even seen chefs make ice cream with it.” "

Milk for production comes from the local breeds of sheep, the Manech and Basco-Bearnaise.The practice of transhumance is still very much a feature of these regions, whereby the shepherds take their sheep to the upper mountain pastures during the summer months to graze on the rich summer grass and flowers. During this time, milking and cheesemaking take place in the mountain huts known as ""cayolar,"" where the shepherds live during the summer. In the autumn the sheep are brought back down to the lower slopes and kept closer to the farm. Cheeses made during the summer are traditionally prized above those made during the winter for their superior flavor.Ossau Iraty was granted AOC (name protected) status in 1980. However, while these regulations govern the general production process and animal management, there remain several variations of the cheese between regions.Production centers around eight major dairies or co-operatives who draw their supply from some 2,000 small farms and dairies. Of these, approximately 100 are farmhouse producers.The texture of Ossau Iraty is uniformly smooth, close and dense and yet remains supple. Flavors are sweet and nutty, with pleasant notes of earth, cellar - especially with the cheeses made during the winter - and flavors of grass, flowers and savory vegetal notes from the summer cheeses."

Mr Madaio feels this also represents the connection of the past with the future, with the towers symbolizing his three children Angelo, Renata, and David and thus the future of Casa Madaio. Both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale, and sales of cheeses are primarily to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase other cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Paglierino, which means Italian for ‘straw’, is one of the cheeses that Casa Madaio brings in and matures in their cellars. Milk for production is sourced from sheep grazing within the national park in Cilento. Shortly after production, the young cheeses are brought to the cellars at Casa Madaio where they’re aged for three months. During this time, the wheels become firmer and more straw-like in color as they lose moisture and the flavors concentrate. The texture is compact, but not firm. Flavors are similar to a young Pecorino with notes of grass and citrus accompanied by a slight peppercorn spicy-ness."

The warm, sunny island is the second largest in the Mediterranean, and is well known for its unique food culture—including its cheeses. Although sheep—and pecorino cheeses—rule in the hills of Sardinia, where shepherds still move with their flocks, Pantaleo is made from goat’s milk. The recipe is similar to the one used for Fiore Sardo,a traditional sheep`s milk cheese from the island. Aged from three to six months, this wheel has a thin pale yellow rind and a paste that is ivory in color with a smooth and firm to dry texture.With a herbaceous aroma that develops into a more caramel-like scent, flavors are sweet and floral with notes of citrus, spruce and a bit of salt.Pair this cheese with an unoaked chardonnay, vermentino, pinot grigio or light to medium-bodied red wines. It`s also delicious when shaved or grated over pasta."
Parmesan (Gold Creek),Gold Creek Farms,United States,Utah,12 in diameter x 5 in height,19-21 lbs,www.goldcreekfarms.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Hard,Microbial,None,Grana / Grating cheese,,"In 2007, Alan and Debbie Gold purchased a 130-acre property in Woodland, Utah, 45 minutes east of Park City. The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. This Parmesan is aged for over a year.A hard, crumbly cheese, Gold Creek’s Parmesan is well suited for grating. Flavor is earthy yet less sharp than other grana-style cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano.Pair it with a Riesling, a Lambrusco or a Prosecco."

Parmigiano Reggiano,Various,Italy,Emilia Romagna,"16-18 ins diameter, 10 ins high",86 lbs,parmigiano-reggiano.it,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,Grana / Grating cheese,,"Considered by some to be the greatest cheese on earth, Parmigiano Reggiano is a magnificent cheese by any standard. According to EU law, it is also the only cheese that qualifies to use the name `Parmesan,` as opposed to other hard grating cheeses made outside Europe. There are hundreds of active producers, including many dairies and factories known as caselli. These are regulated by a ""Consorzio"" (consortium) that upholds the protected name standards, grades cheeses, and handles worldwide advertising and marketing. The protected name designation states that Parmigiano Reggiano can only be made from milk produced by cows fed with a certain percentage of fresh grass and hay within a geographic zone, according to strict regulations. Although the name controlled version is just about 800 years old, the recipe is attributed to Benedictine monks working in the Po Valley in around 1200. For production of Parmigiano Reggiano, a combination of skimmed evening milk is combined with whole morning milk and heated. The curd is coagulated using animal rennet and after cutting and reheating to expel the whey, the curds are packed into very large molds and a simple weight is placed on top to ease out more whey. Cheeses are flipped and re-weighted several more times before being allowed to sit overnight. Prior to finally being unmolded, a plastic matrix, dotted with small blunt needles and a plaque with the identifying number of the cheese producer, is inserted between the cheese and the mold. This matrix spells out the words Parmigiano Reggiano so that when the mold is tightened around the cheese, all the information is gently pressed into the rind. Wheels are placed in a brine solution for up to one month before being transferred to maturing cellars. Parmigiano`s different stages of maturity are recognized by aging seals given at 18 months, 24 months and 30 months. Parmigiano Reggiano received DOP status according to the Stresa Convention that was signed in 1955. Its European PDO status was awarded in 1996.Considering the number of dairies producing this cheese, it`s no surprise that Parmigiano Reggiano varies depending on season and location. A summer cheese might yield more grassy and herbaceous notes, while other versions have more lactic or buttery characteristics, and others have nutty aromas. Age matters, too; younger wheels tend to be fudgier, while paste becomes more crumbly and slightly drier, studded with crunchy amino acid crystals, as maturation continues. Age also results in a concentration of flavor and aroma, and a deepening of the cheese`s characteristic umami.Parmigiano Reggiano can be used in endless cooking preparations and served in many ways, but the most typical pairing is with honey or a balsamic vinegar from Modena.

Paski Sir,Various,,,"2 ¾” tall, 12” diameter",4.5 lbs,,Sheep,,Hard,Microbial,Natural,,,"Located in the Adriatic Sea off the Coast of Croatia, the Island of Pag is a long, wind-swept isle where only the hardiest of people, animals and flora thrive. The island has long been associated with salt production (at least since Roman times) and its unique breed of small sheep, Paska Ovca, whose milk is used to produce Pag’s famous, ancient and award-winning cheese, Paški Sir. These tough little sheep don’t produce much milk, which means that at least 16 sheep are needed to produce just one 4.5 lb wheel of cheese. Pag has hundreds of small sheep farms that make up larger cooperatives, which provide milk to specific cheese producers. The milk that the sheep produce is intensely salty. This comes from the salt deposited on the wild herbs that the sheep graze on by the Pag Bora, the wind produced by the Velebit mountain range on the mainland. This wind catches droplets of water from the Adriatic and dries the water, leaving salt dust, which settles on the island’s vegetation. **Note: Animal rennet was traditionally used, but Croatia does not produce animal rennet anymore and therefore microbial rennet is now used in this cheese.Paški Sir is a hard cheese aged at least 4 months, though various producers offer it at ages that vary from the minimum to 1.5 years. Its very thin rind is the color of the paste underneath ranging from light to dark yellow, depending on age. The texture is dry and flaky with a bit of pleasant graininess. The flavor of a younger wheel is lightly savory with a good amount of salt, reminiscent of the Pag Bora that whips Pag and the aromatic herbs that grow on the island. As the wheels become more mature, the savory flavor intensifies and a tangy bite that is subtle in younger wheels develops a bite. This cheese is made for bold red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Sangiovese. It is best served with wildflower honey or fresh fruits such as grapes."

The farm, originally founded in 1864 by a man named Consider Bardwell, was the first cheesemaking co-op in Vermont. At the time the farm was bringing in a vast amount of milk from surrounding farms in order to make cheese. Fast forward to the 1990`s, when the farm was bought by Angela Miller and Russell Glover who, with the help of cheesemakers Chris Gray and Peter Dixon, have successfully developed it into an entirely new and revitalized cheesemaking business. A herd of Oberhasli goats roam freely in and out of the barn, providing excellent quality milk, while cow`s milk is brought in from Lisa Kaimen`s farm of 30 Jersey cows, located near by. Consider Bardwell produces a variety of natural rinded cheeses, all of which are made in small batches with the use of microbial rennet, and are aged on the farm. Named after a local town close to the farm, Pawlet is made in the style of an Italian mountain cheese, with a semisoft texture.

Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, such as the Mascarpone used in this flavored cheese. To create the Mascarpone Torta, Paula and her team layer their fresh Mascarpone with various fillings: in this case, pecans and chunks of maple praline. Flavorings used in other versions include basil pesto and pine nuts, ancho chili, and sundried tomato.This version of Mascarpone Torta is feels more like a dessert than a cheese. Sweet smelling and very creamy, almost like a thick whipped cream, the torta contains two layers of pecan-praline infused mascarpone surrounding a plain, cream-colored layer. Initial flavors of pecan are balanced with longer-lasting, sweet notes of caramel and maple.This cheese begs to be used as a frosting for carrot cake cupcakes."
Pecorino al Tartufo (Pinzani),Caseificio Pinzani,Italy,Tuscany,"4 ins diameter, 2.5 ins high",1 lb,www.caseificiopinzani.com/en/pecorinocaglio.php,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Flavored,,,"Caseficio Pinzani was founded in 1969 by Guido Pinzani, after a chance encounter with a retired cheesemaker and the opportunity to purchase an ancient small-scale dairy near Pontignano. The dairy, had long been associated with production of classic Sienese pecorino made from raw sheep’s milk, and was at the time (1972), the last remaining producer of the cheese. Since then the company has grown steadily and expanded under the guidance of Guido Pinzani. In 1975, the dairy moved to a new facility between San Gimignano and the imposing Volterra Cliffs. This location is much closer to the pastures where the sheep graze and also the milk source. Milk for production of Pecorino al Tartufo is raw and comes from Sardinian sheep, a breed noted for their milk quality. The sheep are grazed on pasture from Spring until Autumn and, during the summer months, the shepherds make several cuts of hay from the same pastures to augment the sheep’s diet during the winter months. They are never fed silage. For production, the milk is warmed to between 86-98?F (30-37?C) and rennet is added. Coagulation takes place within 30-40 minutes after which the curd is cut, the size of the curd being crucial in terms of determining the texture of the finished cheese since a softer texture is preferred. They whey is drained off and small slivers of white and black truffles are added to the curd. The truffles are sourced from the area between Volterra and San Miniato. The curd is ladled into molds and pressed before being allowed to rest in a warm room. The following day, the newly formed cheeses are dry salted and transferred to aging caves where they will mature for at least 60 days before release. Pinzani’s Pecorino al Tartufo has a semi-soft texture and ivory colored paste, dotted with pieces of sliced truffle. Flavors are rich, buttery and sheepy, with a hint of lanolin, distinct flavors of truffle with undertones of earth and fungus. Pecorino al Tartufo pairs well with a Chianti, Barolo or similar red wine and especially with cured meats made from wild boar or pork."
Pecorino Brigantaccio,Nunzio Marcelli,Italy,Abruzzo,"6 ins diameter,  4 ins high  ",3lbs,www.marcelliformaggi.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced in the Abruzzo region of Italy, just East of Rome, Pecorino Brigantaccio is a raw milk, aged Pecorino, somewhat unusually coated in wheat bran. Made by cheesemaker Nunzio Marcelli using milk sourced from the rare Sopravvissana sheep, the inspiration for this cheese came from a local Pecorino made in the 19th century. During this time, there were a great number of bandits or brigands living in the hills around Abruzzo. They would regularly ambush the shepherds, stealing their cheeses into the bargain. In order to preserve the cheese, the bandits would stash them in clay pots, covering them in straw. They would then place a lighted candle inside the pot and by quickly sealing the entire thing with a goat skin, the oxygen would be burned up, effectively creating a vacuum. In order to simulate this tradition, Marcelli first allows the cheese to age naturally in a maturing cave for between 3-4 months. At this point, cheeses are then vacuum sealed and matured for a further 12-18 months without oxygen. The lack of oxygen results in the cheese aging much more slowly and retaining moisture. At the end of this period, the cheeses are placed in organic wheat bran for a few weeks. As well as replicating the remnants of burned straw in the original recipe, the bran draws out some of the moisture from the cheese and lends a “barnyard” quality to the finished wheels. Pecorino Brigantaccio is matured for between one and two years before release. The exterior rind is a mottled beige and deep red, rusty color, with marked indentations from the cheese forms. The interior texture is firm, dotted with “eyes” or holes and slightly chalky. The cheese has a full mouth-feel. Flavors are very rich, balanced and savory with a slightly fruity tang. There are also notes of lanolin and oats with a pleasantly clean finish."
Pecorino Camomilla,Paolo Farabegoli / Mitica,Italy,Emilia Romagna,,2/3 lb,forevercheese.com,Sheep,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Flavor AddedHerbed,,,"For over 25 years, affineur Paolo Farabegoli has developed cheeses that pay homage to the rustic creations his grandmother would make. Inspired by the flavors and aromas of Paolo’s family traditions, Pecorino Camomilla is a semi-firm sheep’s milk cheese that’s aged and coated in dried chamomile. The cheese—which is made in Italy and imported exclusively by New York’s Forever Cheese—is floral and light in flavor and has a striking appearance, dotted in little puffs of golden flowers.   Pecorino Camomilla is made in the summer, after sheep have grazed on the year’s most verdant grass and when the chamomile flowers are plentiful. After production, the newly-formed wheels mature in humid cells. They’re then put into beech crates, sealed, and coated. Though this particular Pecorino is covered in chamomile flowers, other options might be sprinkled with hemp or cornflower. This lends more than just a pretty look—the dried coating allows the cheese to retain a soft interior, while also giving it a delicate herbaceous aroma.  For another month, the wheels age in constantly changing levels of temperature and humidity to keep their internal moisture. When the cheese is removed from its crate, it’s cleaned and dried. In all, Pecorino Camomilla is aged for about 60 days. And as a final touch, just before shipment, the wheels receive another coat of aromatic chamomile. The resulting wheel is compact, with a smooth, ivory-colored paste enrobed in yellow flowers.Like springtime in a wheel, Pecorino Camomilla tastes lush and creamy with a hint of herbal sweetness and notes of freshly cut apple. With its floral coating, it has a fragrant fruity aroma.Pair Pecorino Camomilla with ripe pears, orange blossom honey, and walnuts on a cheese plate. In a meal, shave onto bright fava beans or peas. To sip, we love to amp up those floral notes with a white that’s similarly fruity like a Sancerre. "

Pecorino Pienza Gran Riserva,Various,Italy,Tuscany,"12 ins diameter, 4 ins high",22-24 lbs,,Sheep,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"The name “Pecorino”, derived from the Italian word for sheep “pecora”, refers to a variety of sheep’s milk cheeses made throughout Italy. Although there are many different styles of Pecorino that are sold at varying stages of maturity, production is especially prevalent in southern and central Italy where the landscape lends itself to dairy sheep. One of the regions most renowned for quality Pecorino is Tuscany, and it is here that Pecorino Pienza Gran Riserva is made, near the city of Pienza. For production, raw sheep’s milk is sourced from local dairies, heated and coagulated. Once firm, the curd is cut into very fine pieces, about the size of a grain of rice and heated again. This releases a large quantity of whey which is drained off. The remaining curd is transferred to molds and the cheeses pressed in a very warm room, which encourages further draining. After being unmolded, the wheels are salted and taken to maturing rooms where they will age for a minimum of three months and usually six months or more. During this time, the wheels will be regularly turned (flipped) to encourage the even distribution of moisture and the exterior rind will be rubbed with olive oil. The oil helps to prevent cracking of the rind and reduce mold growth. The resulting cheese has a smooth, hard interior texture that is golden, straw-yellow in color. The paste can be slightly oily, especially at warmer temperatures, which is a result of the high butterfat content of the sheep’s milk and the application of olive oil to the rind. The exterior rind is brown-gray in color and shows the ridged lines from the original cheese forms. Flavors are sweet, yet slightly piquant and pleasantly balanced with salt. There are hints of almonds and lanolin. There are also small, pleasant crystals within the body of the cheese, that increase with age. Pecorino Pienza Gran Riserva pairs well with spiced fruit chuneys and especially pepper jams. It is also ideal when grated over pasta. It is also a good match with full-bodied Tuscan red wines."
Pecorino Scorza Nera,Gregorio Rotolo,Italy,Abruzzo,"6 ins diameter,  4 ins high",5-6 lbs,www.marcelliformaggi.com,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Ash,,,"Produced by cheesemaker Gregorio Rotolo in the Abruzzo region of Italy, just East of Rome, Pecorino Scorza Nera is an aged pecorino made from raw sheep’s milk. Whole milk is sourced from Sopravvissana sheep, a rare breed native to Abruzzo, renowned for giving limited quantities of very high yielding milk. The sheep graze the hills surrounding the village where the cheese is made. Historically, Pecorino Scorza Nera was so popular during the 19th century, while much of Italy was under the jurisdiction of Naples, that the Abruzzi shepherds, who made the cheese, opened up their own store in Naples dedicated exclusively to selling the pecorino. As is the case with the production of many pecorinos, Rotolo maintains the traditional practice of first using the milk to make his Pecorino and preserving the left-over whey from production to make ricotta. Finished wheels of Pecorino Scorza Nera are coated in a mixture of vegetable ash and olive oil, which protects the cheese from drying out during the 6-9 month aging process. The texture of the cheese is semi-firm with a few “eyes” or holes. Flavors are mild and sweet with rich, floral and nut-like notes and a very clean finish."
Pecorino Toscano,Various,Italy,"Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio","6-9 ins diameter, 3 ins high",3-5lbs,,Sheep,PasteurisedRaw,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Here`s a language lesson: The word for sheep in Italian is pecora—hence the name of this delicious sheep`s milk cheese. There are many different types of Pecorino produced, particularly throughout southern and central Italy, where the landscape lends itself to herding sheep. This iconic version hails from Tuscany. A traditional cheese, its name has been protected since 1986 with a DOP, which has united many local cheeses of similar production and appearance under one umbrella for quality control and marketing purposes. Production of Pecorino Toscano can be from either raw or pasteurized milk, but it`s always made with milk from animals who graze or are fed hay or dried grasses—no silage is permitted. Animal rennet is used to coagulate the milk (which takes 20 to 25 minutes) at a temperature of between 91.4°F and 100.4°F. Curds are cut to about the size of a pea, then re-heated to expel more whey before being put into forms and brined for about 12 hours. Cheeses are then matured in a cellar from three to six months.Pecorino Toscano is sturdy and nutty with a hint of salt and underlying savory and sweet flavors that intensify with age. Although the wheels vary from maker to maker, they tend to be firm and intensely flavored, with a mildly peppery finish, becoming more savory and intense with age while retaining an underlying sweetness and mellow quality.We love shaving Pecorino Toscano over some rye pasta;its peppery and sweet fruity notes at once play to and round out rye’s slight bitterness, while elevating its grassy undertones. It`s also great served alongside finnochiona, an Italian sausage made with fennel."
Pecorino Toscano Fresco,Società Cooperativa Val d’Orcia Società Agricola,Italy,Tuscany,"6-7 ins diameter,  4-5 ins high",5 lbs,www.caseificiovaldorcia.com,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Made in Tuscany in Italy, this version of Pecorino Toscano Fresco is made in the town of Contigiano in the province of Siena by Società Cooperativa Val d’Orcia Società Agricola. The co-operative is comprised of the dairy farmers that supply the sheep’s milk for cheesemaking. Since Pecorino Toscano has name protected (DOP) status, the rules surrounding production of the cheese are strict. As such, sheep’s milk for cheesemaking is required to be sourced from the regions of Tuscany, Umbria & Lazio. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized. Starter culture enzymes and animal (calf) rennet are added to the milk, which is then heated to and held at 95?-100?F (35?-38?C). This promotes curdling, with the effect that the curd breaks into “hazelnut” sized pieces, which are then transferred into molds and are pressed by hand. The molds are moved to a “hot room” and held at a temperature of 82?-95?F (28?-35?C) for approximately 2.5 hours. This accelerates the draining of any excess whey and helps the curd reach the optimal pH levels. At the appropriate moment, the temperature of the room is lowered to 59?-68?F (15?-20?C) and the process of handsalting each form begins. This hand salting is repeated regularly for the first 36 hours, each wheel being salted and turned. Cheeses are then transferred into the aging rooms where, according to the DOP rules, they’re matured for a minimum of 30 days before release. With this version of Pecorino Fresco, there is virtually no distinction between the rind and the interior of the cheese. The texture is smooth, dense and semi-soft and yello-cream in color. Flavors are rich, sweet and mild accompanied by a slight tang. There are hints of almonds, lanolin and grass with a clean, balanced finish."
Pecorino with Pistachio,Sifor,Italy,Sicily,"6-8 ins diameter, 4 ins high",6 lbs,www.formaggisifor.it/ENG,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Established in 1989 near Palermo, Sicily, by Giovanni and Pietro Pastoia, the original vision for Sifor was to help package and market the large number of fresh Pecorino cheeses made by shepherds in the local area. Both founders had considerable experience of the retail world and a passion for cheese. Over the years, the business grew and expanded, to include a warehouse specifically designed for cheese maturation as well as their own production facility based at Montallegro. There, they produce a variety of Ricotta and Pecorino cheeses, some made to traditional recipes and some incorporating entirely new ideas such as their Pecorino made with the addition of pistachio nuts. Made from pasteurized sheep’s milk, Sifor’s Pecorino with Pistachio invokes the ancient Arab influence of the region. Wheels are released when they are quite young, at around 15 days of age with the result that the cheese has a firm yet moist texture that is fairly dense and smooth. Flavors are rich and hint of nuts, salt, citrus and wood."
Pepato,Bellwether Farms,United States,California,"6-7 ins diameter, 4 ins high",3 lbs, www.bellwethercheese.com,Sheep,,Flavor Added,Vegetable,Plastic,,,"Family owned and operated by the Callahan family, Bellwether Farms is located in the rolling hills of Sonoma County, about an hour north of San Francisco and a few miles from the Pacific Ocean. Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, in the early 1990`s Cindy Callahan made the decision to change direction, starting a sheep farm. Although initially focused on lamb production, the Callahans were encouraged to develop their sheep into a milking herd. This, combined with a trip to Italy where they had the opportunity to taste many local sheep`s milk cheeses inspired them to start to experiment with cheesemaking. The sheep at Bellwether Farm consist mainly of East Friesian ewes. The ewes give birth to between one and three lambs each year and the lambs stay with their mother for 45 days before the ewe joins the milking line. Each ewe gives, on average, slightly less than one gallon a day and they are milked for eight months before the cycle begins again. The sheep graze freely year round in addition to being given grain and alfalfa as necessary. Cindy`s Callahan son Liam oversees cheese production while his wife Diana manages the office and Cindy focuses on taking care of the sheep. Pepato is made from raw milk and, although based on an Italian Pecorino, is a Bellwether original. Made from raw milk, Pepato is a semi-soft sheep cheese, aged two to three months and dotted with whole peppercorns throughout. The interior paste is pale ivory in color, punctuated by the black peppercorns, and smooth in texture. Flavors are rich with a harmonious balance of sweet, milky notes countered by the spice of the peppercorns. It makes a wonderful addition to a cheeseboard or shaved on salad or pasta. It’s also quite scrumptious in ravioli or gnocchi."

Errico comes from a family of cheese makers who have been producing Provolone in Italy for over a century. In 1979, he moved his family to the United States and opened his own Italian cheese company.Over the last thirty years, BelGioioso has grown to include seven manufacturing facilities in Northeastern Wisconsin. Using the milk of Wisconsin dairy farmers, the company produces over 25 types of cheese. However, each facility produces only a select few of these cheeses, thereby ensuring high quality and consistency. This has resulted in multiple awards, including several United States, World and American Cheese Society Awards.Originally a Sicilian sheep’s milk cheese, Pepato from BelGoioso has been reinvented as a cow’s milk cheese. The milk may have changed, but the inclusion of peppercorns in the paste has not. Pepato after all means “with pepper.” BelGoioso’s version of this cheese utilizes partially skimmed raw milk and they age the cheese a minimum of 5 months. This provides a firm, smooth texture and pleasantly spiced flavor.Like many spicy foods, Pepato pairs very well with late harvest Rieslings or Gewurztraminer. It can be served on its own with fresh fruits such as grapes or apricots, or it can be shredded on top of potato soup for a spicy kick or into pastas."

Birgit, originally from Germany, had a background in food science, while Robert was working as Fermentation Manager at the brewery. In 2000, after some experimental cheesemaking at home, Birgit enlisted the help of her father, Franz, a master cheesemaker from Germany. Today, MouCo Cheese Company produces soft cheeses using Holstein milk from nearby Morning Fresh Dairy. Production of PepBert is much like production of MouCou’s flagship Camembert, except that a generous heaping of green peppercorns has been added into the mix. The cheesemaking process softens the peppercorns, their spiciness gradually giving way to the Camembert’s natural tanginess.Underneath this cheese’s bloomy rind is an oozing and inviting paste, sprinkled very generously with peppercorns. While the creaminess of the cheese stands up somewhat to the peppercorns, they’re unavoidably strong and biting, providing a texture and flavor contrast with each bite. An ideal cheese for pepper snobs (“we know you’re out there,” say Birgit and Robert).Pair it with a Merlot."
Perail,Various,France,Languedoc,"3 ins diameter, 0.5 ins high",4oz,,Sheep,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Pérail is made by a number of small-scale farmstead and artisianal cheesemakers located in the limestone plateaux region of the Languedoc in southern France. Crafted from raw sheep’s milk, it is relatively unusual in that it is a natural rinded, mold ripened cheese. Production of Charolais uses a time-consuming method of lactic fermentation. This means that instead of rennet being used for coagulation, the milk is allowed to ripen for a period of usually 12-24 hours, at which point is has naturally formed a gel-like curd. The curd is then gently ladled into forms and drained for several more hours before being unmolded. Cheeses are aged for approximately one week prior to release. Pérail has a natural, thin and delicate rind that is pale straw yellow in color. The interior paste is meltingly rich and yielding.The aroma of Pérail is quite pronounced and can be barnyardy.   Correspondingly, the flavors are distinctively delicious and have the earthiness of ewe’s milk balanced with its natural sweetness.Light white wines with a zesty structure such as Saint Veran or white Burgundy make excellent pairings.  For reds, a medium bodied Rhone or Chilean Cabernet would work well."

Production is “fermier”, meaning that it takes place on the farm where the animals (in this case, goats) are raised. Usually cheeses are eaten at about two weeks of age when they have no rind and the interior paste has a light, soft fudge-like texture. (Some producers choose to give their cheeses a light dusting of vegetable ash.) If allowed to mature, moisture evaporates resulting in a drier, firmer texture and the development of a light white and yellow rind. Flavors are citrus-like and fresh with definite floral and herbal notes and a clean finish. The mulberry leaves do not impart any specific flavors, but are mostly for decoration.

Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. In addition to classic French-style Brie and Camembert, Marin French Cheese has begun producing a range of tiny cheeses known as ‘petites.’ Many are simply downsized versions of the company’s most popular cheeses, but Petite Blue is an original in itself. It’s a kind of mix between a brie and a blue cheese; it’s a mold-ripened triple crème with a fuzzy rind, but slicing it open reveals, in addition to the creamy paste, speckles of blue veining. The blue veins result from the addition of P. roqueforti during production, the same type of mold that’s found in French Roquefort. Because the cheese isn’t pressed (it’s simply left to drain), air pockets between the curds remain, in which the P. roqueforti finds space to proliferate.After 10-14 days in the company’s on-site cellars, the mold has grown just enough to speckle the soft, creamy paste with tiny dots of blue. Taste is subtle and savory, reminiscent of brie with a mildly earthy rind. The blue specks yield only a slight blue essence, contributingnotes of salt and seaweed.Pair it with a California sauvignon blanc, a Rhone blend, a port or a lambic ale."

Picodon de la Drôme,Various,France,"Rhone Alps, Savoie","1-2 ins diameter, 1 in high",4oz,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"The origins of Picodon de la Drôme date back to the 14th century when it is thought that production of this small cheese began in an area defined by the Drôme and the Ardèche regions of southern France, straddled by the Rhône River. However, Picodon is also produced in the Gard and the Vaucluse regions, with the result that, not surprisingly, there are regional variations.The name for this little goat`s milk cheese derives from the ancient language of the Langue d`Oc, and means ""spicy."" Milk for production comes from goats that browse the scrubby, drier areas of the lower Rhône, where the flavors of the vegetation tend to be strong.Production may be industrial or fermier, however, regulations for all these cheeses stipulate that a very small quantity of rennet is used. After coagulation, the curd is hand-ladled into cheese strainers, drained and salted. After being unmolded, cheeses are dried and matured for at least two weeks before being sold.The interior paste of Picodon is bone-white which, with age, becomes slightly more straw-like in color, with a translucence underneath the rind. The texture is close and dense and moist when young, becoming drier and firmer as the cheese matures.There are several variations of this cheese that can occur during the maturing process. Some cheeses are allowed to develop naturally, in which case they become coated with blue and white molds. In other versions cheeses are subjected to a process called ""Dieulefit,"" when they are washed and soaked in eau de vie and matured for a month or packed with olive oil and herbs."

The creamery is located at the Volpi Ranch near Petaluma, just north of San Francisco, California, which is also the source for Scanlan`s goat`s milk. Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three. Picolo is a triple cream cheese made from the milk of Jersey cows and crème fraiche.When young, it has a firm, dense texture with a sweet cow’s milk flavor. However, as it matures, it develops an unctuous texture from the outside in and a complex flavor with notes of nuts.Picolo is best paired with sparkling wine. It also pairs nicely with a dry hard cider. Served with fresh fruits such as strawberries, Picolo sings."

With an orange-brown rind and caramel-colored interior, Pleasant Ridge is complex yet approachable, with a taste that lingers and a texture as firm as one’s convictions. It is sure to be the star of any cheese plate.  Following the tradition of Beaufort, a classic Alpine cheese, Pleasant Ridge Reserve is made seasonally from May to October, when the cows are grazing on fresh pasture, and sold at two ages: Regular (7-14 months) and Extra-Aged (15-20 months). In 2001, 2005 and 2010, Pleasant Ridge Reserve won Best in Show at American Cheese Society Judging & Competition.  Pleasant Ridge Reserve`s production began as a collaboration between Mike and Carol Gingrich and their business partners Dan and Jeanne Patenaude, who have since retired. After a successful career in the corporate world, Mike decided to pursue a long-held ambition of creating farmstead cheese modeled after traditional practices in the French Alps. Together, the Gingriches and Patenaudes started Uplands Cheese in the mid-1990`s.   They immediately set to work improving the quality of the pasture by sowing new varieties of grasses, clovers, herbs, and wildflowers. Today, the cowherd at Uplands consists of nine varieties of crossed breeds, bred to be best suited to the farm and to produce the highest quality milk for cheesemaking. The farm incorporates rotational grazing across several dozen separate pastures on their 300-acres of land.  In 2007, Andy Hatch joined the team to take over as cheesemaker, and in 2010, Scott Mericka took over as herdsman. In 2014, Andy and Scott purchased the farm from the Gingriches and Patenaudes.The complexity of the milk gives Pleasant Ridge Reserve a matched complexity of flavor—rich, deep, and smooth, with pleasing hints of caramel and salt. It has a grassy, floral finish that lingers on the palate. The texture is firm and smooth.Although a strong standalone cheese, Pleasant Ridge Reserve pairs well with jammy cabernet sauvignon, pear and apple slices, rosemary herb bread, and dried cranberries.

Amy and Stephen Hueffed first started dreaming of a lifestyle change during an inspiring trip through Northern California, where they sampled local cheeses and pondered one day producing their own. Fourteen years later in 2005, after taking Washington State University cheesemaking classes in Pullman and Skagit Valley, Amy and Stephen finally settled onto their farm with a flock of 60 dairy ewes. Since then Willapa Hills, now home to three generations of the Hueffed family, has continuously revised and expanded its activities and product line. The diverse mix of sheep’s milk, cow’s milk and mixed-milk cheeses is produced with a long-term commitment to sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. For example, the farm has switched over to growing all of its own hay, lowering costs of overall feed and ensuring that hay is natural and free of pesticides and commercial fertilizers. Pluvius was the Greek god of rain, and a historic pass just west of the farm on State Route 6 is appropriately named after him. The pass gets upwards of 140 inches of rain each year, which according to Stephen, “also explains why the grass grows so well in the Willapa Hills and why the milk in our cheese is so reach and creamy.” Wheels of the cheese are aged for at least two months.In keeping with its name, Pluvius exudes a humid, earthy aroma reminiscent of the air outside in a forest or a field just before it rains. Paste is creamy, soft and butter-colored, with an enjoyable texture dotted with eyes. Flavor is salty, especially toward the rind, with a mushroomy funkiness and a hint of truffle.Pair Pluvius with a Pinot Grigio or with an amber ale."

This might be the country’s only remaining granular curd cheese, a vintage style with an open-bodied curd texture that ends up sort of—but not exactly—resembling cheddar. While like the cheese, the creamery is full of history—Calvin Coolidge’s father built it in 1890, making it one of the oldest in the U.S.—it’s now being run with a young, innovative cheesemaker at its helm. A true foodie, Vermont Institute of Artisanal Cheese founder Jesse Werner has scoured the world for innovative ingredient combinations to flavor several versions of the granular-curd cheese. “He loves being inspired by how flavors show up in the cheese, how they can be enhanced by cheese flavor and vice versa” says Sarit Werner, Jesse’s wife and branding and marketing manager for the company. Out of all the flavor combos—which include Hot Pepper, Garlic Peppercorn and Sage & Herbs—the Sambal, laced with a mix of an Indonesian-style spicy relish and Vermont maple syrup, is perhaps most reflective of the company’s innovative outlook. In addition to a lineup of flavors, Plymouth offers its flagship cheese in different ages of maturation: East Meadow is aged 60 days and Original Plymouth is aged a year, while Hunter matures for over two years. Rectangular blocks are hand-waxed and adorned with colorful labels—designed by Sarit—before sale. The company sources all of its raw milk from a nearby single herd of Jersey and Holstein cows.Flavors vary greatly; when pairing, experiment with a variety of Vermont beers."

Pont l'Eveque,Various  ,France,Normandie,"4 ins diameter, 1 in high",8 oz or larger,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Made in Normandie, in northern France, Pont l”Eveque is a traditional washed-rind, cow’s milk cheese. Once made in substantial quantities and granted AOC (name protected) status in 1976, production now takes place in only six dairies across the region. Jerome and Francoise Spruytte are third generation cheesemakers and one of the six producers of Pont l’Eveque. Each day, they transform 800 liters (211 US gallons) of milk, sourced from 80 Normandie cows, into approximately 230 cheeses per “make” or batch. After warming the milk in the vat and adding cultures and rennet, the milk is left to coagulate. An hour later, the soft, fresh curds are gently transferred onto a large open table, lined with linen. The transfer breaks the curds apart, releasing the whey and they are allowed to drain as Jerome scoops up the remaining solids into square shaped cheese molds. The young cheeses in the molds are allowed to sit for a few hours, draining further, before being turned out and placed on plastic mats laid across wire racks. At this point, the cheeses are still very soft, so the Spruytts crowd them onto the racks, placing a metal band around the outside to help them maintain their shape. For the next four or five days, the cheeses are each turned 90 degrees to prevent them sticking together. On day three, the cheeses are salted which promotes further draining and the desired rind growth. On day six, the cheeses are transferred to an aging room where they remain until they are at least 15 days old. According to AOC rules, Pont l’Eveque cannot be released for sale until 20 days, but Jerome recommends eating his cheeses at between 28-42 days. At this stage the cheeses take on a flavor of freshly cracked hazlenuts with a soft, unctious texture and aromatic, orange-pink rind."

Also: cheese-fueled biking is a nice way to burn those calories. It was that very attitude that drew the former Pennsylvanian to a 100-year-old dairy farm in Goshen, which he purchased and rebuilt alongside his wife, Barbara. The duo now make cheese with respect for the local terroir and environment, using raw farmstead milk from Holstein cows in an energy-efficient operation completely fueled by solar power. Inspired by rustic French wheels of Tomme de Savoie, Porter is a lightly pressed, semi-firm cheese. During three to four months of aging wheels are turned weekly but not washed, encouraging a slow development of a mottled natural rind.That stony rind encases a flexible, light yellow paste with tiny scattered holes. Waxy and vinegary on the nose, its flavor develops slowly on the palate with notes of raw garlic, onion and milk, plus flicks of acidic tang.Pair with medium-bodied red wines like cabernet or shiraz, or serve alongside dark red fruits."

It all goes down at Cahill’s farmhouse cheese, a third-generation, family-owned, small scale cheesemaking business located near Newcastle West in County Limerick in southern Ireland. This history of the business began in 1902 when David Cahill bought a working dairy farm on the banks of the river Deel. Initially, the dairy farm supplied fresh milk to the nearby Newcastlewest Creamery. However, after a series of setbacks, David changed direction and began selling milk door to door which proved to be more lucrative. In order to better serve this business he constructed another small dairy. Ten years later, in 1920, the dairy passed to David’s nephew, William Cahill. William and his family continued to grow the business and started producing soft cheeses in the 1950’s.  Today, the business focuses more on small-scale, hand-crafted flavored cheeses, including this Irish Porter Cheese which the company first started to make in 1991. Cow’s milk is sourced from local dairy farms and pasteurized for production. The Guinness-brewed porter is added to the curd after it has been formed and the whey drained off, which is what gives the cheese its striking appearance. Wheels are matured for a minimum of nine months and are graded before release. They have a waxed rind which helps to seal in the moisture. The interior paste clearly shows the delineation between curd and porter and yet has a smooth, dense texture. Flavors are smooth and rich. The taste of porter is distinct without overwhelming the milky flavors of the cheese.Pair it with—what else?—an Irish porter. Try the West Indies Porter from Guinness."

The milk arrives from Wadeland at about midnight when it’s just a few hours old. Cheesemaking begins almost imemdiately, starting with pasteurization and the addition of starter cultures. After being left to ‘ripen’, microbial rennet is added to coagulate the milk, which is then hand cut. The excess whey is drained off and the remaining curds are “cheddared” to achieve the right moisture and pH level before being put through a mill and finally transferred into molds for pressing. After unmolding, the young cheeses are cold-smoked over English walnut shells and whole red apples. Beehive’s small batch smoker has the capacity to hold approximately 6 wheels of cheese at a time.

Their commitment to artisanal cheeses, their desire to connect farmers and consumers, and their delicious cheeses found in farmers’ markets and grocery stores soon became known throughout the area.  In 2017, the Lees sold the dairy to two longtime employees, Carrie Routh Bradds and Bobby Bradds. Both have farming roots in the community stretching back to 1740, and they worked at the dairy for twenty years before assuming ownership. They remain committed to changing how the public views their food through farm visits and Dinner at the Dairy in the fall and spring. Goat Lady Dairy now partners with local family farms to continue their production of goat and cow milk cheeses. Providence actually started out as a cheese gone wrong. An attempted Taleggio-style cheese didn’t turn out as planned, but the cheesemakers decided that they liked the firmer version they ended up with. Curds are ladled into square forms, and flipped as they drain, leaving the unpressed cheese with small fissures after it ages for four months.Providence`s rustic natural rind encases a cream-colored paste that`s slightly crumbly. Flavors are grassy, nutty, and slightly yeasty, with addictive saltiness and sweet caramel overtones.Pair it with membrillo or with a crisp gose-style beer."
Provolone,Various,Italy,Various,Various,,,Cow,,Semi SoftFirmHard,Microbial,Waxed,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),," It might be a ubiquitous selection at the deli counter, but there`s a whole lot more to this cheese than you might expect.Although now imitated in other regions of the world, true provolone originated in southern Italy, near Naples, and later spread to Lombardy and Veneto in the north. Today the OG versions from those respective regions—Provolone del Monaco and Provolone ValPadana—have geographic indications that protect the production region and process as well as the names. Here`s another surprise: Provolone is a cousin of mozzarella. Both are made in the style ofpasta filata, which means“spun paste” in Italian—aptly named because these cheeses undergo a unique stretching process that gives them a characteristically stringy, stretchy quality. Theprocess begins with the customary steps: The milk is curdled, the curds are cut into pieces, and the whey is drained off.But then it gets fun. The next stage is thefilatura(spinning). Curds are steeped in a bath of very hot whey or water. When they begin to float, it’s time to drain off the liquid. The curds are then mixed and kneaded until they achieve a soft, stringy texture. The mass is then divided into smaller cheeses, often by forming balls or pulling out a thick strand and chopping it, much like a taffy pull. Some versions, like mozzarella, are sold fresh. Others, like provolone, are aged. Regardless of its starting shape–either a ball, a pear, or a long sausage–provolone is often distinguished by its deep, sculpted depressions thanks to the rope from which it hangs. Although months’ worth of gravity would shape any cheese, provolone is particularly affected because that stretching renders itmalleable. Even as it becomes dry and crumbly, there`s a softness that lasts through the aging process. Traditional Italian provolones are aged minimum of four months and flavor of the cheeses varies from thedolce (sweet) version with a mild taste to asharp, tangy piccanteversion yielding more pronounced, assertive flavors.The smooth, pale yellow rind of provolone is generally not eaten. The interior paste of the cheese is also pale yellow, becoming darker with age.High-quality versions boast a dense (but not rubbery) paste and a subtly nutty flavor. And while most of us know provolone as turkey’s mild, milky sandwich partner, the cheese becomes more complex with time—aged up to three years, provolonepiccantetakes on a sharp, almost spicy quality as it matures and is best served on a cheese plate or grated over pasta.Provolones are great melters, thanks to the way their curds are stretched and pulled during the make process; try incorporating them into one of our recipes."

Starting out by gardening in three square-meter patch of soil, the Glasgows and their two children eventually upgraded to a farm in Martha’s Vineyard in 2009. They’d been coming to the small island off the coast of Massachusetts during summer vacations for years, and were impressed by its vibrant core of small family farms, its arts and food scene, and its natural beauty. After years of research and planning, the Glasgows finally obtained their first three cows in 2010. Today the Certified Organic farm boasts a herd of 25 heritage breed Dutch Belted cows. The cows are grass fed and moved twice a day throughout the farm’s pastures. In winter when they don’t have access to fresh pasture, they’re fed sprouted barley seeds that the Glasgows grow in a specially designed greenhouse. The sprouts grow in six days and provide the cows with a good source of nutrients, energy and vitamins. After experimenting with various cheesemaking styles, the Glasgows decided that the mild and damp climate of Martha’s Vineyard, with its salty tang in the air, would be perfect for a washed-rind cheese. They named their cheese Prufrock, and it’s made each morning with fresh milk from the farm. The milk is warmed and cultured, curdled using vegetarian rennet, and the curd is cut and stirred. Then curd is hand-ladled into square molds and flipped several times. The squares rest overnight in the creamery, and the following morning they’re placed in a brine bath for salting. After salting, they’re placed in the cave to be aged for six weeks, and washed by hand daily.Prufrock has a delicate yet pungent paste, with a bright orange and sticky rind. Flavors are salty and savory, toasty and nutty with hints of tropical fruit and sour cream.Pair it with a Belgian wheat beer, a glass of luscious Burgundy or a crisp, bubbly glass of Champagne."

The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Cypress Grove produces a variety of fresh, flavored chevres, each of which have their own distinct identity and name, mirroring the ingredients used as well as the company’s play on words. For production, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are then added. The mixture is moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt and formed into disks. Herbs and other flavorings are added by hand. The disks are then vacuum sealed, labeled and sent directly to market without aging. Cypress Grove’s Fresh Chevre is available in several varieties; Ms Natural, Purple Haze, Herbs de Humboldt, Sgt Pepper and PsycheDillic that known collectively as the Flashback Family of Chevre. With PsycheDillic, the addition dill and rare dill pollen add fragrant, deeply complex notes.Flavors are balanced and lingering."

Quadrello,Caseificio Quattro Portoni,Italy,Lombardy,"6-8 ins diameter, 2 ins high",5 lbs,www.quattroportoni.it,Buffalo,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced near Bergamo in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, Quadrello di Bufala is a washed-rind cheese made by brothers Bruno and Alfio Gritti at Caseificio Quattro Portoni. One of the things that sets this cheese apart is that, although it bears several similarities to Taleggio or Brescianella Stagionata, it`s made from the milk of water buffalo, a practice that is generally much more associated with cheesemaking in southern Italy. With a strong background in dairy cattle farming, both Bruno and Alfio found they were struggling to make a viable living, largely due to steadily falling fluid milk prices. Although converting to cheesemaking would have added value to the milk, it would also have put them in direct competition with some of the region’s most dominant dairies. For that reason, they made the bold decision, in 2000, to purchase their first 40 water buffalo from a local Lombardy farmer and, along with some help from an instructor at a local dairy school, began to develop various cheese recipes using the buffalo milk. Today, with the number of water buffalo nearing 1000 head, Quattro Portoni are producing a number of different cheeses all made from buffalo milk, including Blu di Bufala, Granbu, Casatica and Quadrello. Quadrello is a washed-rind square weighing roughly five pounds.To make Quadrello, fresh milk is pasteurized and then sent into a special boiler into which ferments and rennet are also added. The resulting curd is cut, spun, and left to rest. When the cheesemakers remove the curd from the boiler, they place it in molds that are subjected to steam and then allowed to rest at room temperature. At the end of the steaming, the product is salted in brine.  During the maturation process, cheeses are washed with brine every five to six days in order to encourage the development of the rind before being released for sale at between 35-40 days.The texture of Quadrello is soft and fudge-like, with an interior paste that is bone white in color–a reflection of the buffalo milk. The rind is pale orange in color, dotted with occasional white mold, and marked with deep striations that result from being drained on straw. Expect aromas of earth and mushrooms, with flavors of sweet cream, grass,and hay.Pair with off-dry or fruity white wines."

Having spent time with a small-scale cheesemaker in Brittany during the 1970s, Allison was working as a state dairy lab technician in Vermont when she responded to a request from Bob Reese to produce some fresh chèvre for a state dinner. At the time, Bob was employed as marketing director for the Vermont Department of Agriculture. The chèvre was a hit and after some experimentation, Bob and Allison decided to go into production on a more formal basis, founding Vermont Creamery. Milk for cheese production comes from twenty-one family farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Quebec. Each farm has an average herd size of approximately 150 goats. Vermont Creamery makes a variety of fresh and young style cheeses and cultured dairy products, many of which are based on French recipes. They also make an outstanding cultured butter. Cheeses are made from either goat`s or cow`s milk. Quark, which means “fresh curd” in German, is a European-style fresh cheese that is often the key ingredient in cheesecake, as well asin many recipes that call for cream or similar fresh dairy products. Vermont Creamery makes Quark using fresh cow’s milk curd that is slightly drained in cheesecloth and then whipped with a small amount of crème fraîche to create its silky texture and nutty taste."

Techniques for making the cheese were first introduced to the mountainous tropical region in the 17th century by Portuguese immigrants, who modeled the recipe after the traditional sheep’s milk Serra da Estrela from their European homeland. To make Queijo Minas Artesanal Araxá, the cheesemaker warms and then inoculates raw cow’s milk using “pingo”, a small quantity of whey from a previous batch that’s rich in microorganisms. After coagulation, the curd is cut and stirred, then placed into hoops. Wheels are pressed, turned, and brined before being sent to aging caves where they’re washed and turned every other day. The cheese is consumed in fresh, semi-firm and hard versions, after aging periods of one week, one month and two months respectively.The paste of Queijo Minas Artesanal Araxá is consistent, cream-colored and firm, possessing no holes, while the rind is thin and cream-to-yellow colored.Taste is buttery and salty with a noticeable acidic tang. When aged longer, it becomes firmer and more spicy.Queijo Minas Artesanal Araxa can be eaten fresh and is also commonly used in the local version of cheese bread."

Not really pleased with the bitterness of the bay leaf and having recently received a request to produce a queso freso/queso blanco style cheese, theteam decided to drop the bay leaf and sell the fresh cheese under another name. The cheese’s new Hispanic name, which translates into “summer cheese,” echoes its similarities with fresh Mexican styles, while the cheese remains a versatile product, serving as the “base cheese” for Silvery Moon’s Casco Bay Dulse and Rosemary’s Waltz cheeses. To produce this cheese, the milk is first gently batch pasteurized – at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer -- in an effort to preserve the integrity of Smiling Hill Farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. The milk is then cultured and renneted, and the curd is cut and ladled into molds without further heating. After draining for 20-24 hours, Dorothee and her team unmold the cheeses and leave them on draining mats for another 20-24 hours. While on the draining mats the squares are dry salted, then they’re packaged and sold within two months.With warm milky aromas of fresh curds and butter, Queso de Verano has a moist and springy texture that crumbles a bit in the mouth.

Having originally bought the farm from his parents, David was among the first small-scale cheesemakers in the United States to begin producing sheep`s milk cheese in 1990.Because there was no template or model, the early days were not easy, and in David`s own words he discarded a great deal of cheese. However, after a visit to the French Pyrenées he became inspired to make sheep`s milk cheese along the lines of those made in the Pyrenées.Major Farm was also among the first to dig their own maturing caves, which are built into the side of the hill at their farm. They make two types of aged cheese; their original cheese Vermont Shepherd made form sheep`s milk. and a new creation called Queso del Invierno (meaning Winter Cheese), made from a blend of sheep and cow milk.Both types are shaped almost like a flying saucer which is a result of the colanders that are used for pressing.For production, David Major uses a blend of 80% Jersey cow`s milk, sourced from the small herd at Ranney Ridge Farm located about 3 miles away together with 20% Major Farms sheeps milk. Due to seasonal milking, during the winter time, frozen sheeps milk is used.Milk is heated, starter cultures and rennet are added and, after coagulation, the curds are cut. The whey is drained off and the remaining curd is packed into colander shaped molds, that give the cheese its distinctive shape. The cheeses are pressed and drained for 2-4 hours before being brined. They are then transferred to the underground aging caves and matured for between 4-5 months before release.The texture of Queso del Invierno is firm and slightly flaky without being brittle. The interior paste is a pale golden yellow because of the Jersey cow`s milk.

Queso Oaxaca (Mozzarella Co),Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,3 inch ball,0.5 lbs,www.mozzarellaco.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Paula’s inspiration for the creation Italian pasta filata cheeses stems from her love of Italian cheese as well as her frustration at not being able to find Fresh Mozzarella in Dallas during the 1980’s. Determined to put this right, she spent time at a small cheese factory near Perugia where she learned to make fresh mozzarella. Paula continues to use the pasta filata cheesemaking skills that she learned in Italy in the production of her range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk, sourced from Dairy Farmers of America, is pasteurized. Starter cultures are added to the milk along with rennet. Once coagulated, the curd is cut both horizontally and vertically by hand with cheese knives, forming the curds into small soft cubes and releasing a quantity of excess whey. The curds are allowed to “rest” in the whey until they reach the correct texture. At this point, hot water is poured over them and the curds are stretched and worked with a small paddle until they become malleable, smooth and satin-like in texture. This is the most crucial and skilled part of the cheesemaking process, because there’s only a small window of opportunity to stretch the curd. If the curd is worked before the pH level reaches 5.2, it becomes tough and inferior. However, if the pH falls too low, the curd won’t form into cheese. Assuming all goes well, desired shapes are pinched off from the stretched curd and immediately tossed into cool water to chill down. In the production of Mexican-inspired Queso Oaxaca, the curd is stretched into long ribbons, which are then rolled into balls. One the balls are chilled, they are briefly placed into a brine solution.Mozzarella Company’s Queso Oaxaca smells of sour milk and butter, and has a pliant, tender paste. Strings pull apart nicely without breaking. Flavor is tangy and yogurt-y yet mild, with hints of Meyer lemon.Pair this Queso Oaxaca with a light, fruity white wine such as a Sauvignon Blanc."

Queso Tetilla,Various,Spain,Galicia,"3.5-6 in diameter (base), 3.5-6 in height",1-3 lbs,www.queixotetilla.org,Cow,Pasteurised,Firm,Animal,Natural,,," Take one glimpse of this traditional cheese from Spain’s northwest Galicia region, and you won’t forget it—especially when you learn the meaning of its name. Spanish for “nipple,” tetilla is a nod to the wheel’s unique shape. The cheese’s name has been protected by a PDO since 1996, a regulation that’s enshrined the use of fresh whole milk from Friesian, Brown Swiss and Galician Blonde cows. The cheesemaking process begins soon after milking: milk is coagulated using traditional animal rennet or a mix of native starter cultures, curds are cut into a pea size, “washed,” (with the removal of whey and addition of hot water), and molded into the specific size and shape before being brined. A relatively young cheese, Tetilla wheels are ripened for a minimum of seven days and cleaned repeatedly so that the surface stays smooth and tawny.Young and buttery, without excessive acidity or bitterness, the cow’s milk round yields faint hints of vanilla and walnut. Paste is compact and ivory-colored, while the rind is thin and smooth.Most often consumed as a dessert or snacking cheese, traditional accompaniments for Queso Tetilla include nuts, honey, or quince jam. For a terroir-based pairing, sip a crisp Galician Albariño."

The best ones are acknowledged to come from the Bagnes Valley (Val de Bagner) around Verbier, and one of the benchmark cheeses is produced by Dairy 98 and ripened by Rolf Beeler.One of the keys to this cheese`s superiority is that it`s made from the milk of two breeds of cow: the Fribourgeois (which also produce the milk for Vacherin), and the Ehringer (or Heren in French), a large, heritage German breed cow that produces a small quantity of milk that is very high quality.Raclette is an uncooked, washed rind mountain cheese that is aged for up to a year.The paste is silky and semifirm, with a light aroma of earth and cellars when warm. It has a full, milky flavor.Traditionally a half wheel of Raclette would be propped up in front of the fireplace, exposing the cut surface to the heat. Once the smooth interior had begun to soften and blister, with the aid of a ""racleur"" (scraper), the cheese would flow like lava into waiting bowls of steaming, boiled potatoes.Intensified by the heat, the cheese oozes flavors that are sweet, tangy and slightly fruity, overlaid with an assertive bite with more aged wheels."

Like many goat’s other milk cheeses from the Alps, this cheese is produced in a similar way to its more well-known cow’s milk counterpart: raw milk is curdled using rennet, pressed into a large wheel, brine-salted and then washed periodically in while aging over three months. While cow’s milk cheeses have long been commercialized here in the Savoie, goat’s milk cheeses were usually consumed within the household until a few decades ago. When farm owners Rebecca and Jean-Yves Zuccarelli left their day jobs in cities in the mid-1990s to start their goat farm in Bellevaux, having a farm focused exclusively on chèvres was uncommon. But over the years these cheeses have come into their own, partly due to the work of people like Rebecca and Jean-Yves. Today Rebecca heads the consortium devoted to promoting and protecting another classic goat’s milk cheese, Tomme de Chèvre de Savoie. She welcomes visitors to her farm and home, leading educational demonstrations and selling local products in an on-site shop. This perfect-for-melting cheese is decidedly less stinky than its cow’s milk cousin. Flavor is buttery and mild with a subtle meaty savoriness, hints of dark cocoa and creamsicle and a goaty finish.This perfect-for-melting cheese is decidedly less stinky than its cow’s milk cousin.

Raspberry BellaVitano,Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,13 in diameter x 4 in height,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin.Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to their production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible.For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off.The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey. Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation.Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale.For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels of BellaVitano Gold are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing.This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings—in this case, a raspberry tart ale.The raspberry tart ale flavor contributes a fresh and fruity aroma, with background notes of pineapple. But the flavor doesn’t permeate throughout the wheel; rather, it helps to balance the saltiness of the cheese. It strikes out into raspberry territory without letting the fruit overpower the palate. Pair Reserve Raspberry BellaVitano with a light Italian red, a Sherry or a Riesling. For beer pairings, try a Porter, a Belgian Sour, a Brown Ale, or a Framboise Lambic. It also pairs quite well with chocolate!  "
Rawstruck,Coach Farm,United States,New York,7 in x 3.25 in ,4 lbs,www.coachfarm.com,Goat,,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,,,"Located in Pine Plains in New York’s Hudson River Valley, Coach Farm produces a range of fresh and mold ripened cheeses from the milk of their closed herd ofFrench Alpine dairy goats.The idea for Coach Farm originated with the Cahn family, owners of the famous Coach Leather bags. In 1983 they purchased an abandoned farm two hours north of New York City and became inspired to re-establish it as a working dairy.Rawstruck is Coach Farm’s first raw-milk cheese. According to cheesemaker Mark Newbold, the company had wanted to venture into new cheesemaking territory but didn’t have the facilities to make a hard cheese. Realizing that there were little to no domestic raw-milk soft goat cheeses on the market, Mark and his team decided to try a raw milk version of their popular pasteurized cheese.When Rawstruck was released as an unnamed cheese in April 2013, Coach Farm teamed up with culture:the word on cheese, asking bloggers and readers to help them think of a name.In making Rawstruck, Mark and his team take fresh milk—never more than a day or two old—and raise its temperature only to inoculation levels before renneting. After waiting for coagulation it is then cut, salted and gentlyhandladled into molds, where it drains naturally. It’s then aged for at least 60 days in coolers with specific temperature and humidity levels.The steps are similar to those in Coach Farm’s other cheeses, except withoutpasteurization. As a result, Rawstruck develops a unique flavor profile and texture.While it’s crumbly when cut, it’s fluffy and delicate on the palate. The rind and creamline are also delicate on the palate, yet the wheels are sturdy and hold their shape. The edible rind contributes a mushroomy, earthy background to the taste while the paste is very creamy with notes of citrus and a slight tang. The aftertaste is pleasant and lingering. According to cheesemaker Mark Newbold, the lingering and complex aftertaste is more pronounced in Rawstruck than it is in Coach`s  pasteurized-milk cheeses. Pair Rawstruck with berries or light fruit, anything floral, orange blossom honey, a kolsch, a sparkling vouvray or any crisp white wine. "

The farm spans more than 500 acres and is home to 100 registered Jersey cows. The 42 milking cows produce over 600,000 lbs. of milk each year.Reading is a semi-soft Raclette-style cheese with a washed rind.Production began In 2010 when cheesemakers at Spring Brook Farm began experimentingwith a second cheese to follow Tarentaise, one that could work well with existing equipmentat the cheese plant. It took a year of trials to finalize the recipe.Unlike Tarentaise, which is exclusively a farmstead cheese, Reading is made with Jersey milk from partner farmsin nearby Vermont towns.The milk must be produced by Jersey cows, who are fed only pasturegrass, dry hay and some grain. Partner farms are paid a premium forthe milk (significantly more than they would receive by selling into a mixed-source tanker truck), and work closely with Spring Brook in maintaining all-around high quality.Spring Brook Farm hauls the milk directly from the local farms to the production facility.Reading ages for 3 to 5 months, during which it is turned and washed periodically.It has a creamy, nutty flavor, which is sometimes almost floral or grassy with a pleasing, long-lasting complexity.Reading is ideally suited as a table cheese and fits very well on a cheese plate with chutneys or other cheese-friendly condiments. It pairs well with Belgian style beers and dry white wines.  It also melts exceptionally well; there`s very little fat separation until the cheese reaches a bubbling heat. When melted, it retains its silky smooth texture and can be used in a range of dishes-- from traditional Raclette or fondue to delicious mac and cheese. "
Reblochon Fermier,,France,"Rhone Alps, Savoie","4-5 in. diameter, 1 in. high",1 lb,,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Granted AOC protection in 1958, Reblochon is a classic mountain cheese from the Haute Savoie/Rhône Alps region of France.The name Reblochon is derived from the French verb ""reblocher"" which means to squeeze a cow`s udder again, recalling the Savoie herdsmen who invented Reblochon. In the 13th century, farmers were completely dependent on landowners who insisted that all the herd`s milk was their property. So come milking time, the herdsmen didn’t quite complete the milking: After the bosses had left, they would return to extract a little more milk from the cows. The second milking is always creamier, and this was the milk used to make Reblochon.The milk for this cheese must be locally-produced raw cow’s milk from the Montbeliarde, Abondance, and Tarine breeds of cow. The milk must be brought to the place of production as quickly as possible, and renneting must be done within 24 hours of the last milking. After production, the cheeses are put into a cellar to dry, turned every two days, and washed with whey to aid the development of the rind.Reblochon is a beautifully proportioned cheese with a thin, orange-yellow to pink, close-textured, velvety rind. The paste is very smooth, supple, and ivory in color.Flavors are mildly fruity with notes of bacon. It has a nutty aftertaste that contrasts with its cellar aromas.Pair with dry white wines like Crépy or fruity red wines like Beaujolais."

Having had a successful tenure at the New Belgium Brewery as a process engineer, Ryan started to become interested in cheesemaking. Together with his friend Matt, Ryan began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After 2 years Will decided to pursue other interests and Matt and Ryan assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing Marketing, Sales and general business issues. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsular’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses all made from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a 275 cow dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Named after the trees of the old growth forests of the Olympic Peninsular, Red Alder is a washed rind cheese made using a rennet-based coagulation process. After pasteurization, cultures are added to acidify the milk and rennet is added. After coagulation, the curd is cut, heated and stirred before being carefully transferred to the cheese molds where it’s allowed to drain. After unmolding, the young cheeses are brined and then transferred to a drying room where they’re left overnight. They are then moved to an aging room where they will remain for about twenty one days. During this time, they are regularly washed with a brine solution in order to create the formation of the rind. When the cheeses are ready, they are wrapped and stored in a cooler before release. Red Alder has a delicate pale pink and white rind with a slightly waxy texture. The interior paste is ivory colored and gently dotted with small holes and slits. Aromas and flavors are earthy, cave-like and pleasantly musty."

Red Dawn (Ceased Production),Prairie Fruits Farm,United States,Illinois,"3 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",5 oz,www.prairiefruits.com,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Paprika,,,"Located near Champaign, in southern Illinois, Prairie Fruits Farm is owned by Leslie Cooperband and Wes Jarrell, who purchased it in 2005 with a view to operating a mixed use, small-scale fruit farm and goat dairy. With careers as professors within the Wisconsin and Illinois university systems, (Wes as head of Agricultural Science, and Leslie with a strong background in soil science and management) both bring a great deal of experience to farming life. Wes generally takes care of the goats and does the milking, while Leslie oversees the cheesemaking. The herd of Nubian and La Mancha milking goats currently numbers about 60 within a closed herd system. The milk is of extremely good quality and yields exceptionally high solids. The most recent development is that Prairie Fruits Farm is buying a limited quantity of sheep`s milk from a local Amish dairy farmer. To that end, Leslie has started experimenting with several sheep`s milk cheeses that compliment the existing range of goat`s milk cheese. Leslie produces several different varieties of cheese, ranging from a fresh chèvre through to a raw milk blue. Most of her sales take place at Farmers` Markets or go to select retail stores, where invariably demand exceeds supply. Made from the milk of the Prairie Fruits Farm goats, Red Dawn is a mold ripened cheese named after the striking red sunrises that occur on over the prairie where the farm is located. Cheeses are made by gently hand-ladling the curd to help preserve moisture. During the cheesemaking process, geotrichum cultures are added to the milk and at one week of age, the rind is dusted with a Spanish smoked paprika. The white of the geotrichum mold gently grows over the paprika, giving the rind an appealing blend of colors. Cheeses are released for sale at about three weeks of age. At this point, the interior texture is semi-soft and supple and bone white in color.Flavors are fresh and lactic with underlying notes of smoke and bacon."

Cheesemakers followed the triple cream recipe for the creamery’s Mt. Tam, a mold-ripened triple cream. But they soon discovered that during the summer months, a natural strain of Brevibacterium linens moves down the coast of West Marin when a few batches of Mt. Tam were subjected to the bacteria.The cheesemakers washed the cheese with a brine solution—which promoted, instead of eradicated, the B. linens. Instead of trying to resist nature, the cheesemakers embraced West Marin’s natural flora and let it thrive. Quickly, Red Hawk was born, and it has since become one of the creamery`s most popular cheeses.Cowgirl Creamery, based in Marin County, California, is the vision of owners Sue Conley and Peggy Smith.Friends since their college days in Tennessee, the two moved to California in the 1970’s—where they both made careers in the restaurant industry. In Berkeley, Peggy Smith worked at Chez Panisse with Alice Waters, while Sue Conley co-owned the famous Bette`s Ocean View Diner.Decades later, in the 1990s, Conley and Smith formed Tomales Bay Foods, a distribution company designed to provide an outlet for Marin County’s agricultural food products. They found that the new company filled a tremendous local need, so they expanded operations to include a storefront to sell locally-made food products, as well as a cheese making operation that became known as Cowgirl Creamery.Today, Cowgirl Creamery has shops around the Bay Area and its larger operations and warehouse are still based in Petaluma. Cowgirl Creamery produces a range of award-winning fresh and mold-ripened cheeses using organic cow`s milk from small local dairies.

Four generations later, Chris Roelli leads the cheesemaking process in the exact same spot. In the past two decades, Chris has led Roelli cheese to shift its focus from industrial cheddar production to small-scale, artisanal production of American originals. With the recent completion of a state-of-the-art aging cellar, Chris’s production has doubled, and his repertoire continues to expand. While making a batch of orange cheddar one day in 2011, Chris tipped an extra dose of annatto coloring—plus some blue mold spores—into the vat. The experiment yielded Red Rock, a loaf-shaped blue cheddar style with an unforgettably colorful appearance. Few piercings lend it a milder blue flavor, which is still punctuated by an earthy, all-natural rind that develops in the aging cave during a maturation of two to six months. Colored with twice the amount of annatto found in a traditional Wisconsin cheddar and poked through the center to promote the growth of blue mold streaks, this cheese is has a striking, unforgettable appearance.Flavor is creamy and complex, reminiscent of a cheddar but with a hint of blue at the finish.Pair it with a roija, a zinfandel, or a small-batch bourbon."

Also: cheese-fueled biking is a nice way to burn those calories. It was that very attitude that drew the former Pennsylvanian to a 100-year-old dairy farm in Goshen, which he purchased and rebuilt alongside his wife, Barbara. The duo now make cheese with respect for the local terroir and environment, using raw farmstead milk from Holstein cows in an energy-efficient operation completely fueled by solar power. Unlike the company’s Caerphilly-and-Cantal hybrid Welsh Cheddar, Redmond is modeled after a more traditional English cheddar. It’s formed into blocks of 40 pounds before being aged for six months, and then cut into five-pound and 7.5-ounce blocks for sale.This firm cheese exudes musty and sweet caramel aromas. Taste is reminiscent of a classic, creamy sharp aged cheddar, with a tang that hits the side of the mouth and a lingering finish yielding hints of toast, cream and onions.Pair with apple cider, a gamay, a pinot noir or an IPA.

Some of the whey is drained off, the pieces of curd are washed with hot water, drained, and then transferred into molds.The newly formed wheels are pressed for a minimum of 24 hours before being unmolded and placed in a brine bath for a further 36 hours. After this, they are moved to the farm’s aging facility and matured for between six and eighteen months at a temperature of between 51-54º Farenheit.Two varieties of Remeker are available. A few limited-production wheels have a natural rind that is rind-rubbed with ghee and these are only available at certain times of year. More widely available are the wheels that receive a natural, breathable coating that protects the rind and the interior of the cheese.The interior paste of Remeker is a beautiful saffron yellow color - a reflection of the rich Jersey milk, while the texture is firm - hard depending on the age of the cheese. Aromas are of butter, nuts and herbs, while the flavors of the cheese include hazlenuts, burnt caramel and butter.  On more aged wheels, mild notes of anise can also be present.Good pairings for Remeker include a buttery, non-oaky Chardonnay or a slightly chilled Port."

Parish Hill’s cheeses are inspired by the traditional cheeses of Italy. They’re handmade in small batches using raw milk, which is produced at the Elm Lea Farm at the Putney School. The farm is just five minutes down the road from the cheese house, and its milking herd grazes on fresh pasture from June to October. Parish Hill cheese production happens from May to November in order to take advantage of the pastures that give a highly aromatic quality to the milk, resulting in complex and subtle flavor variations. Milk for cheesemaking is ripened using homegrown cheese cultures, which are produced by inoculating the farm’s raw milk with pure bacterial strains and then propagating them continuously. Traditional calf rennet is sourced from Europe and Quebec, and sea salt is sourced from the Maine Sea Salt Company in Marshfield. Reverie is modeled after a traditional tomme cheese. Wild mold growth is encouraged during 5 to 10 months of aging, resulting in a rind that resembles gray stone.Smell is slightly sweet, while texture is semi firm and pliable, toothsome and somewhat crumbly in the mouth. Initial notes of milk and pepper give way to a buttery finish and a earthy, mushroomy aftertaste.Pair Reverie with a Barbaresco, a Barolo, a Pinot Grigio, a Belgian amber or a hoppy IPA."

Ricotta al fumo di Ginepro,Nunzio Marcelli ,Italy,Abruzzo,"3 ins diameter, 2 ins high",12oz,www.marcelliformaggi.com,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Animal,Smoked,,,"Produced by cheesemaker Nunzio Marcelli in the Abruzzo region of Italy, just East of Rome, Smoked Ricotta al fumo di Ginepro is a smoked, aged ricotta made from the whey of raw sheep’s milk. The milk is sourced from Sopravvissana sheep, a rare breed native to Abruzzo, that are renowned for giving limited quantities of very high yielding (fat) milk. The sheep graze the hills surrounding the village where the cheese is made. Marcelli first uses the milk to make Pecorino, preserving the whey from production for his ricotta cheeses, including the Ricotta Ginepro. They whey is heated to 176?F (80?C) which causes any residual proteins (curds) to float to the surface. They are then scooped up and gently transferred to molds where they are allowed to drain naturally for several hours. After unmolding, dry salting and drying, the cheeses are cold-smoked for twelve hours using juniper wood. They are then transferred to aging caves and allowed to mature for two months. Flavors of Smoked Ricotta Ginepro are prominent and yet delicate and balanced. There are obvious notes of smoke and juniper with an underlying rich sweetness from the sheep’s milk. The texture is moist, dense and fine."
Basket Ricotta,Bellwether Farms,United States,California,"3 ins diameter, 3 ins high",1 lb,www.bellwethercheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Vegetable,Fresh,,,"The Callahan family own and operate Bellwether farms in the rolling hills of Sonoma County, just a few miles from the Pacific Ocean. Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, Cindy Callahan decided to change direction in the early 1990s and start a sheep farm. Today her herd consists mainly of East Friesian ewes, found grazing freely outside year-round. Cindy’s son Liam Callahan oversees cheese production, while his wife Diana manages the office. To supplement the range of sheep’s milk cheeses, the Callahans also buy local Jersey cow’s milk in order to make thisricotta. Renowned for its rich, buttery characteristics, Jersey milk has a higher fat and protein content than most milks, which gives this cheese a wonderfully rich, balanced flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Although Bellwether make a couple of varieties of whey-based ricottas, these are only sold locally. In order to fulfill national demand, Liam has developed a whole cow`s milk ricotta, made using cultured milk that has been allowed to acidify naturally for many hours until it`s ready to begin the heating process. Making ricotta this way requires constant attention. Once heating begins, Liam stands at the vat watching for just the right moment to stop stirring, letting the curds form. The curds are then hand scooped into small ricotta baskets and allowed to drain naturally under their own weight. In keeping with Italian tradition, the ricotta is sold in the same basket, resulting in the minimum of disturbance of the curd and the maximum retention of moisture. This gives the finished ricotta a remarkably delicate, soft texture and lactic flavors of cream and butter with a clean finish that leaves you longing for more."

Founded in 1953 by Joseph Calabro, a native of Sicily, Mr Calabro immigrated to the United States in 1948. Shortly afterwards, he and his son Salvatore began to deliver fresh ricotta, mozzarella, and sausages to families within Fairfield and New Haven counties. In 1958, Mr. Calabro joined forces with the Gambardella Cheese Corp. of New Haven, forming the Gambardella / Calabro Cheese Corp. The company has grown steadily over the decades, but is still best known for its Ricotta production. Calabro ricotta is made from Grade A cow’s milk, carefully sourced from Vermont. For production of the cheese, the curd is still hand-dipped and hand-packed into Calabro’s instantly recognizable metal containers that are pierced with tiny holes to allow the whey to drain, even after the cheese is shipped. The texture of Calabro Ricotta is delicate, fluffy and creamy. Flavors are sweet, rich milky and buttery. Although delicious when eaten straight, this ricotta is a wonderful ingredient in Italian filled pastas and pastries such as cannolis."

Rynn started down the path of a high powered corporate career with a side passion for food, but that all changed when she met David, an Italian-American from New Jersey with a natural talent for cooking. After an eventful trip to Italy, the couple decided to quit their jobs and travel and study food in Italy. Upon their return, David began working as a chef and the couple decided to open their own dairy with Rynn at the helm. The Caputo Brother’s Creamery opened its doors in 2011 after a final trip to Italy to ensure that their cheese-making technique was fine-tuned. Rynn and David source the milk from a local creamery and focus on fresh and stretched cheeses. This Ricotta is made in limited quantities using traditional techniques learned in Italy. Rynn and David use the remaining sweet whey from the production of their Mozzarella to produce their Ricotta. Acidic coagulation forms the curd in the re-cooked whey, which is then hand-skimmed using baskets. These curds are then lightly salted and allowed to drain under their own weight in the baskets.As a result, the Ricotta has a smooth texture and a sweet, custard-like flavor.Ricottta can be served with fresh fruit or honey drizzled on top, or it can be used in a variety of recipes. This includes stuffed peppers and lasagna for savory recipes, or in sweet recipes such as Cannoli or Cheesecake. A bright white wine such as Gavi would work brilliantly with Ricotta."

Partnering with Josh Halder from Verde Farms and former Fruition Restaurant sous chef Jimmy Warren, Siedel’s idea was to create a learning center and a sustainable relationship between farm and restaurant, spreading awareness among community members and local restaurants of the fundamentals of farming produce, animal husbandry and the creation of artisanal products. After attending the Dairy Sheep Association of North America’s annual symposium in the Hudson Valley, the trio was inspired to create Colorado’s first artisanal sheep dairy and creamery. Less than a year later, in September of 2010, they welcomed a flock of 40 milking ewes and one ram. Cheesemaking began three days later. Today Fruition Farms sells lamb and sheep’s wool in addition to three farmstead cheeses, which are produced using whole sheep’s milk from twice-daily milkings.

For owner Allison Lakin, becoming a cheesemaker evolved from a background in anthropology, education, and technical theatre. When the opportunity arose in August 2011 to start her own business, without having her own cows, she took the plunge. According to Allison, cheesemaking combines her fascination with science with her love of magic. Milk for production is sourced from a single, certified organic and grass fed herd of Jersey and Jersey cross cows. She is working toward having her own farm, but currently is renting space from another Maine cheesemaker to produce her cheese. Currently, Allison makes cheese a few days each week, producing a variety of fresh and aged cheeses that are sold either via her local farmers’ market, restaurants and specialty food shops in Maine and New England. For production of the Fresh Ricotta, curds are hand-ladled into a basket mold and allowed to drain under their own weight. This results in a cheese that slices beautifully but that can also be blended or used for cooking.There is no salt added.Flavors of the Ricotta highlight the seasonal nuances of the milk with lactic fresh, cream-like notes and an underlying citrus tang.Pairings: bagel and lox; salted nuts; dried fruit."
Ricotta Lana,Major Farm/Vermont Shepherd Cheese,United States,Vermont,"8 ins diameter, 3.5 ins high",6.5 lbs,www.vermontshepherd.com,Sheep,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Fresh,,,"Made at Major Farms near Putney, Vermont, Ricotta Lana is named after cheesemaker David Major’s youngest daughter. David bought the farm from his parents and was among the first small-scale cheesemakers in the United States to begin producing sheep`s milk cheese back in 1990. At the time, because there was no template or model for such an operation, the early days proved quite difficult, and in David`s own words they discarded a great deal of cheese. However, after a visit to France, he became inspired to make sheep`s milk cheese along the lines of those made in the French Pyrenées. Today, David makes two types of aged cheese in addition to Ricotta Lana; the original cheese called Vermont Shepherd which is made from 100% sheep`s milk and a relatively new creation called Queso del Invierno, made from a blend of sheep and cow’s milk. Ricotta Lana is made as a by-product from re-heated and pasteurized whey left over from production of Vermont Shepherd. Although some Ricotta Lana is sold in containers, the majority is pressed using colander shaped forms into distinctly shaped wheels – the identical shape used for the aged cheeses. Although the recipe for Ricotta Lana is based on the Italian Ricotta Salata and Lana has a drier texture than most fresh ricottas, it is not as dry or firm as Ricotta Salata. Lana has a deep concentration of rich, sweet and delicate flavors that make it really delicious. Ricotta Lana lends itself to numerous serving and cooking applications from lasagna or a salad to just a drizzle of honey on top of crusty bread."

Founder, Johann Englert, came across Al Ducci`s Groceria in Manchester, Vermont during a visit and when she tasted their mozzarella, it transported her back to her time in Italy during college. Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lives. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today, Maplebrook Farm is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. It employs around 20 cheesemakers, who are each trained in old world cheesemaking techniques. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Mike still is the head cheesemaker for the majority of their cheeses, but as of 2010 now has help from Domenico Marchitelli, who makes the Burrata and Scamorza. Domenico hails from Puglia, Italy, the birthplace of Burrata. Maplebrook Farm’s Hand-dipped Ricotta is a very fresh Ricotta made in very small batches using rBGH-free milk and no preservatives. The cheesemakers produce the cheese in small kettles by hand using vinegar to begin the process of curd development rather than rennet.The result is a Ricotta with a rich, delicate texture. It has a subtle, sweet flavor that is balanced with a touch of salt. Traditionally, Ricotta is used in deserts and in fillings for stuffed pastas such as Ravioli. Maplebrook’s Hand-dipped Ricotta is no exception. With its various uses in cooking, either a bold red wine could be used, when using the Ricotta in pasta dishes with tomato sauce, or a light white wine when it is used in desserts."
Ricotta (Old Chatham Sheepherding Co),Old Chatham Sheepherding Co,United States,New York,Varies,4 lbs,www.blacksheepcheese.com,SheepCow,,Soft,,,,,"Located in the upper reaches of the Hudson River Valley, Old Chatham Sheepherding Company was founded in 1993 by Tom and Nancy Clark, with 150 East Friesian ewes. It may be said that it was destined to happen, since at 10, Tom won a blue ribbon at the Dutchess County Fair for his Hampshire Sheep. At the time he pronounced to a local newspaper reporter that he wanted to raise a flock when he grew up. After life took his career in a different direction for a number of years, the Clarks did in fact end up raising that flock when they built Old Chatham Sheepherding Company. The couple has been involved in every aspect of the company, from the design of the barns to cheesemaking to working to maintain the property. The Clarks not only produce cheeses, but also sheep’s milk yogurt. In fact, in 2007, the yogurt was in such demand that the milk supply on the property was strained. Fortunately, Old Chatham began a program working with a number of Amish farmers in their area to increase those farmers’ sheep milk production. This ensured the Old Chatham was able to continue to produce all their products. Their own flock now numbers over 800 ewes comprised of East Friesian, Dorset Finn and various crosses. As such, Old Chatham constitutes the largest sheep dairy in the United States. Old Chatham’s Fresh Ricotta is unique in that it uses a mixture of cow and sheep’s milk. The process of making it begins with the sweet fermented whey left over from the production of a soft ripened winter cheese. Cow’s milk and sheep’s milk is added to the fermented whey, which acts like rennet, separating the curds in the milk mixture. It is heated until fine curds form and the mixture is cooled. The curds are then removed and the Fresh Ricotta is born!Because this cheese is just formed curds, Ricotta is very moist and rich in texture. With the use of mixed milks, Old Chatham’s Ricotta has a tangy element added to the incredibly fresh, sweet milk flavor of traditional Ricotta.Ricotta can be used in traditional Italian deserts such as cannoli or cheesecake, but it can equally be used in sauces to add an extra bit of richness, or on its own with fruit. Pair this cheese with Prosecco for a refreshing combination."

His father produced a variety of Swiss classic hard and semi hard cheeses such as Tilsiter and Emmentaler in the Thurgau region.Upon completion of his cheesemaking apprenticeship, Moser moved to France where he worked - and fell in love - with the French soft ripened cheeses there. After his return to Switzerland, he bought the dairy in Dotzigen and for several years divided his time and labor between his father’s business, where he made classic Swiss cheeses and his new venture where he produced only soft cheeses.Quintessentially, Moser is an excellent cheesemaker who is also a good businessman. His facility is modern, efficient and streamlined and the cheeses he makes are reliably consistent. As such, he has positioned his business to supply larger customers such as grocery store chains as well as smaller independent stores.Moser works exclusively with cow’s milk sourced from larger milk co-operatives. With the exception of his Crublanc which is made from raw milk, all Moser’s products pasteurized. For production of the Riesling x Sylvaner, Moser adds a blend of 2/3 of thermophilic and 1/3 of mesophilic starter cultures, which contribute greatly to the cheese’s character. The surface of the cheese is innoculated with aerobic yeast cultures as well as a geotricum mold. The latter controls the growth of the yeast and keeps the surface from becoming too wet.Once the curd is in the forms, the young cheeses are allowed to drain under their own weight. This expels some of the whey and allows the curd to knit together. During the first 24 hours, the cheeses are turned or flipped three or four times which promotes the even distribution and drainage of moisture and then placed in a brine bath for 90 minutes.The next stage is the aging room. There, the cheeses are kept for between eight and ten days at a humidity of between 85-95% and a temperature of between 58-60?F - lower humidity and higher temperature in the beginning, higher humidity and lower temperature towards the end. During this time, the Riesling x Sylvaner receives a second bath, this time comprised entirely of wine, for a period of twelve hours.The wine has a small amount of sugar left after its fermentation.  Also, the yeasts influence the paste and flavor, resulting in a mild cheese with a hint of sweetness."

Originally hailing from the slopes of the Massif du Pilat, the cheese takes it name from the word ‘rigot’ (meaning small stream) and the town of Condrieu, 40 kilometers south of Lyon. It’s been made in this region since the 19th century, and it was granted AOC status in 1997.According to AOC regulations, Rigotte must be made from whole raw goat’s milk that is no more than 24 hours old. Goats must have access to fresh grass for at least 120 days per year, and free access to pasture for 180 days per year. Silage and genetically modified feed products are prohibited.In production of Rigotte, lactic acid bacteria and rennet are added to fresh milk, and the mixture is left to set for about 24 hours until the curd becomes firm and homogenous. After the curd is hooped, the discs are left for a further 24 hours to drain. The cheese is then dry salted and matured for a further eight days, developing an ivory, finely wrinkled rind and a soft, creamy paste.Flavors are nutty and delicate, with notes of hazelnut, honey and acacia.

These winds have come to be known as the Roaring 40`s, and are the basis for much of the interesting history of King Island.During the 15th and 16th centuries, as the Roaring 40`s swept across the trade routes causing shipwrecks, straw mattresses from many parts of the world drifted ashore. Their seeds germinated in the rich island soils and created the lush pastures that set the King Island dairy industry apart.Today, dairy cows graze on the thick pasture, supplementing their rich diet with the occasional nibble of kelp washed ashore after heavy storms. Consequently, there is no need for the artificial feed supplements and stock growth additives that other farmers have come to rely on.Cheese production takes place under the direction of Swiss-born Ueli Berger, who has an inexhaustible passion for cheesemaking which began very early in life. As the grandson of a cheesemaker and son of a dairy farmer, his European childhood provided plenty of opportunity to explore the craft.After studying cheesemaking in Switzerland for three years, Berger moved to Australia to work for a soft cheese manufacturer. He moved to King Island in 1998 to become King Island Dairy`s head cheesemaker.Roaring Forties Blue is a full-flavored blue with a sweet, slightly nutty character, a rich mouth feel and long finish.Cheeses are matured in their wax coating, which cuts off the oxygen supply, promoting its sweet and fruity flavor, as well as retaining moisture, creating a smooth and creamy texture.Try pairing it with a smoky Australian Shiraz."

Milk for production is thermalized, which allows many of the milk`s original characteristics to shine through.Robiola della Langhe (sometimes known as Robiola Bosina) is square in shape with a thin rind encasing a rich blend of cow`s and sheep`s milk.Robiolas are available in various formats, shapes and sizes. However, Robiola della Langhe has a silky paste with smooth, well-balanced flavors and the rind is sturdy enough to protect its interior while it ripens to a deliciously runny consistency.Robiola was originally produced solely from goat`s milk, with the goats often supplementing their grazing with brambles and wild thyme, thus giving a characteristic to Robiola which many locals believe has been diluted by the introduction of the mixed milk recipe.When young, the Robiolas from Caseifico dell`Alta Langa are moist, sweet and rich. At an age of about 20 days, the cheese develops a slightly reddish, sticky rind and becomes supple, creamy and slightly tangy, underlining the presence of goat`s milk.The production of Robiola has been protected since 1989."
Robiola di Roccaverano,Various  ,Italy,Piedmont,"3-4 ins diameter, 1 in high",8 oz, ,SheepGoatCow,,Soft,Animal,Mold RipenedLeaf Wrapped,,,"Robiola di Roccaverano is made in the small area of in Roccaverano within the Piedmont region of northern Italy. According to the President of the ""Consorzio di Robiola di Roccaverano"", the majority (90 - 95% ) of cheesemakers use 100% goat`s milk for their cheese. This is not only because its in keeping with the traditions of the region but also, according to the President, results in a higher quality cheese. The livelihood of many smaller goat dairies and cheesemakers depend on this outlet for their goat’s milk for their income. However, in addition there are several larger commercial producers of Robiola di Roccaverano that make a version from blended cow, sheep and goat’s milk. Although most commonly, these cheeses are found outside the region for export, it causes some confusion as to the correct definition. This quirk of regulation, created in 1989, surrounding the type of milk used, is a result of the larger producers’ early influence in the creation of the definition of Robiola di Roccaverano – a definition that despite attempts to overturn it by the smaller traditional producers, remains in place. (It`s worth mentioning that this applies only to Robiola di Roccaverano and is not linked to other Robiolas, such as Robiola Bosina.) However, regardless of milk type, rounds of Robiola di Roccaverano are wrapped in chestnut leaves and, when young, have a moist, sweet and milky flavor with an underlying richness. With age, cheeses develop a slightly reddish, sticky exterior and become supple, creamy and slightly tangy. The paste of the cheese has a fine-grained consistency and is bone-white in color. Flavors are delicate, savory and slightly sour with a pronouced tang that diminishes with age."

Here, in an area known as the Langhe in the province of Cuneo, the Cora family produce a range of Robiola cheeses made primarily from goat’s or sheep’s milk. For some of their cheeses, sometimes cow`s milk is blended with the other milks. The cheesemaking business was established in 2000 by Gianni and Paola Cora. Although the couple had previous careers, they were both passionately interested in preserving traditional local foods and after Gianni spent some time training with local cheesemakers, decided to launch their own business. Production of cheese at Cora is now very much a family affair as Gianni and Paola have been joined by their daughter Lorena and son Francesco in the tiny dairy. Robiola Fia are made in very small batches between February and November each year from unpasteurized goat`s milk. To form the curd, starter cultures are added to the milk which is then left alone for 36 hours. During this time, the cultures work very slowly to form a fragile curd, known as a lactic acid set. At the end of the process, a very small amount of rennet is added to give the curd a little strength and, once fully formed, it is ladled incredibly gently into the molds to preserve as much integrity and moisture as possible in the finished cheese. After draining and unmolding, cheeses are individually wrapped in one of a variety of leaves. Chestnut, fig, cherry, walnut, vine and even cabbage leaves are sourced from the local area, picked during the summer months and stored for use as needed. In addition to protecting the delicate, rindless cheeses, the leaves also impart an individual flavor to each cheese and encourage the growth of specific molds over the course of the two-month aging process. Robiola Fia is wrapped in fig leaves. Underneath the leaves, the cheese has no rind apart from a few areas of mold. The texture is extremely fragile and yielding.The fig leaves give the cheese a sweet, vegetal aroma and a pleasant flavor of coconut that balances the lactic notes of the cheese beautifully.Since there are so many flavors going on with these cheeses, they need little in the way of accompaniments although a fruit compote and hazlenuts work well."

The Abbey was founded in 1230 by Trappist monks who, in the nineteenth century created a small range of cheeses alongside the famous Rochefort Trappist beer. The cheeses remianed in production until 1970 when, due to lack of manpower, they were forced to cease production. However in 1999, at the request of the town of Rochefort, Mathot-SOFRA, under the guidance of its owner Arthur Mathot, began to produce the cheeses according to the original recipes created by the monks. Along with the traditional Abbey cheeses, the company also makes various flavored cheeses, including the Rochefort with Ouessant Seaweed. Made from pasteurized cow’s milk, the cheese uses Ouessant seaweed harvested from an island off the coast of Brittany in northwestern France. The texture is semi-soft and smooth with a yellow paste densly populated with fine strands of seaweed, which gives the overall paste a darker appearance. The rind is also yellow and made of Plasticoat – an edible plastic coating. Flavors are rich, vegetal and savory with notes of sea salt, a slight tang and a clean, smooth finish."

Upon Tom`s death in 1998 (aged 100), Ig took over and then finally sold it to the duo in 2002, with the stipulation that they would continue to make the creamery’s signature cheeses according to tradition. Today, Rogue Creamery is a thriving business that produces a variety of award winning cheeses in addition to the originals that the Vella family created. Milk for production comes from Rogue Creamery`s own USDA Certified Organic dairy that sits on a 75-acre property with a quarter mile frontage on the Rogue River, which is used to irrigate the pastures. The milkers go out on pasture daily, when weather permits, (from March to November), but are not exclusively grass-fed, as they also consume organic hay and grain. Aged for between eight months and one year, Rogue`s multiple award winning Rogue River Blue is an unusual and delicious raw milk cheese, wrapped in pear liqueur-soaked grape leaves. The leaves are hand-selected from local organic and biodynamic Cowhorn Vineyard.Aromas are of earth, cellar, sherry and port.

The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. This cheese is his cow’s milk twist on the traditional Italian sheep’s milk Pecorino Romano, which is named after the city of Rome.Aged for two years, Gold Creek Farms’ Romano is creamy with a sharp tang. As it becomes progressively firmer over time, it can be used in similar ways to the Italian staple; it is well suited to grating and as a cooking ingredient, for example in a risotto.Pair it with a Pinot Noir."

It is produced throughout the regions of Aveyron and part of the nearby départements of Lozère, Gard, Hérault and Tarn, in southern France. This is an area famous for its limestone geology, which dictates the species of grass and wildflowers that grow upon it, and thus influences the taste of the milk. The mold that gives Roquefort its distinctive character (Penicillium roqueforti) is found in the soil of the local caves. Traditionally the cheesemakers extracted it by leaving bread in the caves for six to eight weeks until it was consumed by the mold. The interior of the bread was then dried to produce a powder. Nowadays the mold can be produced in a laboratory, which allows for greater consistency. There are just a handful of Roquefort producers. The largest by far is Roquefort Société, made by the Société des Caves de Roquefort (a subsidiary of Lactalis), which owns several caves and allows public visitors. Roquefort Papillon is also a well-known brand. Other producers include Carles, Gabriel Coulet, Fromageries Occitanes, Vernières and Le Vieux Berger.The interior paste of Roquefort is white, crumbly and slightly moist, with distinctive veins and pockets of blue mold.

Raw sheep’s milk Roquefort is protected by an Appellation d’Origine in France and in Europe, meaning that all cheeses using the name must follow a production and affinage process that adheres strictly to tradition and to high quality standards. Papillon takes this a step further; in addition to 200 controls on average, their version of Roquefort is constantly checked by a master affineur, from salting when it first leaves its refrigerators to the ripening and wrapping process. Quality is evaluated based on the openings and the veins in the paste, the cheese’s texture, and the characteristics of its blue mold. Cheeses are aged for 19 days in the Combalou mountain caves, then transferred to the company’s cellars for four to five months.This cheese’s smell is powerful: rich, tangy, and reminiscent of bread and yeast.

With milk from his small herd of goats he produced fresh, ready to eat cheeses at a small factory. However, by 1990, the business had expanded to the point that he was ready to move to a larger location, where the business remained for seven years. Soon after the move, Josep began producing aged cheeses starting with what would become his signature cheeses, Nevat. Now located in the village Vilassar de Dalt, north of Barcelona in Cataluña, Spain, Josep has developed a reputation for excellent cheeses including Nevat and Ros. Formatges Can Pujol still uses the milk from their own herd of goats, but also buy milk from neighboring farmers in their area in order to keep up with demand. Ros (also marketed under the name Ombra in the USA) is an aged sheep`s milk cheese invented in 1993. The name Ros means ""blondie"" in Catalan and was chosen to reflect Cuixart`s nickname, (due to his fair hair) and the straw color of the cheese`s interior when mature. Wheels are about three inches tall, with a natural rind, coated with gray and brown molds. The minimum age is four months, but the cheese can withstand up to ten months of ripening.The interior paste is firm and close-textured and occasionally studded with crunchy nuggets of crystalized amino acids. Flavors are of butterscotch and pineapple, and well balanced between citrus acidity and the sweetness of the milk.The sweetness of the cheese pairs well with a fairly spicy wine, such as Rioja."
Rosemary and Olive Oil Asiago (Sartori),Sartori,United States,Wisconsin,12-14,20 lbs,www.sartoricheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,None,,," Established in 1939 by Paolo Sartori, Sartori Cheese Company is a fourth generation family owned business based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. Well known for hard and Italian-style cheeses, the company sources milk from local, family owned farms within a close radius to the production facility. The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible. For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey, which is drained off. The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops, then pressed for several hours. Newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey.  Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath, which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation. Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale. For the production of some of Sartori’s cheeses, carefully selected wheels are chosen to undergo a third stage of finishing. This last stage involves the application by hand or soaking of a proprietary blend of one of a variety of coatings—in this case, a mixture of rosemary and olive oil.Pronounced herbal scents complement this Asiago’s mellow, grassier tones. The cheese just begins to approach a pointed sharpness before gently backing off, and although the rosemary only lightly permeates the body of the cheese, it really comes through in the rind. It’s piney, floral, buttery and earthy.Pair Rosemary and Olive Oil Asiago with Chardonnay, Chianti, or Sherry. For beer pairings, try an IPA, an American Pale Ale, or a Porter."

However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian type cheeses, as well as this Montasio, inspired by the aged Italian classic of the same name. The original, PDO-protected Italian version of this cheese is produced in a mountainous region near Venice. Like the original, this Texan version becomes nuttier in flavor and firmer in texture as it ages for six months. But in this case, Paula and her team have spiced up the traditional recipe with added twists such as rosemary.Firm and grateable, a rosemary flavor pervades throughout this cheese, slightly overpowering its sweet and fruity Montasio base. We’re reminded of Utah pine scrubs.Pair Rosemary Montasio with a pinot noir, or incorporate it into a pasta dish."

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt, who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” Rosemary’s Waltz is a fresh cheese garnished with rosemary and juniper berries. To produce this cheese, the milk is first gently batch pasteurized – at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than in a continuous pasteurizer – in an effort to preserve the integrity of Smiling Hill Farm’s raw milk and to produce a more unique and flavorful cheese. Milk is then cultured and renneted, and the curd is cut and ladled into molds without further heating. After draining for 20-24 hours, Jennifer and her team unmold the cheeses and leave them on draining mats for another 20-24 hours. While on the draining mats, wheels are dry salted. The process is the same as in the production of Silvery Moon’s Queso de Verano, except that in this case wheels are rolled in chopped dried rosemary and garnished with juniper berries. Large wheels are cut into 16 wedges, then packaged and sold within two months. Small wheels are packaged whole and sold directly to restaurants and retail stores.Lactic and curdy with a hint of rosemary on the nose, Rosemary’s Waltz is tangy and fresh-tasting, with an intense and lingering rosemary and juniper flavor in the paste.Pair it with a cranberry preserve. In cooking, crumble it over a salad or over a baked squash."

Roundabout,Coturnix Creamery,United States,Colorado,12 in diameter x 4 in height,12 lbs,www.coturnixcreamery.com,Sheep,Pasteurised,Hard,Microbial,None,Cheddar-like,,"In the town of Windsor in Northern Colorado, Caille Gash produces sheep’s milk cheeses under the Coturnix Creamery label, which she sells (along with fresh cow’s milk, ice cream and cheeses) at her Cozy Cow Dairy store. Caille remembers first being inspired to make cheese as a 10-year-old girl, looking through a window into a cheesemaking facility during a tour with her family. Today visitors can do the same at Cozy Cow Dairy. Milk for Coturnix Creamery cheeses is sourced from Irish Cream Sheep Dairy, located just over the border in Bushnell, Nebraska. The small farm has been owned and operated by the Halligan family for 30 years. The Halligans originally raised sheep, cattle and alfalfa, but in 2005 decided to diversify and start milking their ewes. Since then, the focus has been on building numbers and managing dairy genetics, and production has been increasing each year. Roundabout is a milled-curd cheddar produced using 100% sheep’s milk. Wheels are aged anywhere from three months to a year.A dry, firm and flaky texture and a balance of sweetness and sharpness characterize this sheep’s milk cheddar. The flavors of sheep’s milk are delicately woven into the cheese—not overpowering at all, but accumulating in a slow, subtle build before the palate gets hit with a final, semi-sweet flash of caramel. Nutty aromas are subtle yet lingering.Pair it with a Bordeaux or with a sherry."
Rove de Garrigues,Various,France,Provence,"1.5 ins diameter, 1.5 in high",2oz,,Goat,,Soft,Animal,Fresh,,,"Made in the Garrigues region of Provence in southern France, Rove de Garrigues is produced exclusively from the milk of Rove goats, a rare breed native to the area. Having originally been developed as a meat breed, Rove goats produce much less milk than an average dairy goat – usually about two liters per day as opposed to five. However, their their milk has an extremely high butterfat content, making it ideal for the production of fresh cheeses such as Rove de Garrigues. Butterfat in milk has the capacity to translate the flavors of pasture and forage. The goats roam and browse the countryside in the mountainous Garrigues region which is naturally laden with thyme, citronella, rosemary and other herbs. Consequently, these flavors are immediately evident in the finished cheese. Rove de Garrigues was traditionally produced by the nomadic goat herders of the region and sold at local markets. Although these raw milk cheeses are still available locally, several cheesemakers are now making pasteurized versions that are more widely available. Rove de Garrigues are best eaten as young as possible, preferably within about two weeks of production. At this stage, the delicate flavors are balanced by a gentle tang that leaves a very fresh, clean taste in the mouth. There is no external rind, but as the cheese matures, it develops a more yeasty flavor that can detract. Cheeses are made in two ounce rounds and are bone white in color. The texture is dense, fine and moist. They pair well with white wines such as Cotes de Ventoux."
Rupert,Consider Bardwell Farm,United States,Vermont,"14 ins diameter, 5 ins high",25 lbs,www.considerbardwellfarm.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"Located in Vermont`s beautiful Champlain Valley, Consider Bardwell is a relatively new cheesemaking operation with very old roots. The farm, originally founded in 1864 by a man named Consider Bardwell, was the first cheesemaking cooperative in Vermont. At the time, the dairy was bringing in a staggering amount of milk from surrounding farms in order to make their cheeses. Fast forward to the 1990`s, when the farm was bought by Angela Miller and Russell Glover who, with the help of cheesemakers Chris Gray and Peter Dixon, have successfully developed it into an entirely new and revitalized farmstead cheesemaking business. The farm is also home to a herd of Oberhasli goats that roam freely in and out of the barn, providing much of the quality milk for cheesemaking. In addition, cow`s milk is brought in from a nearby farm belonging to Lisa Kaimen, who owns a herd of 30 Jersey cows. Consider Bardwell produces a number of natural rinded cheeses, all of which are made in small batches using microbial rennet. Rupert, which is the most aged cheese made at Consider Bardwell, is named after one of the oldest towns in Vermont. The recipe is based on the aged, mountain style cheeses such as Comte or Gruyere, made from raw milk. For production of Rupert, after coagulation, the curd is cut as small as possible. To release a high percentage of moisture (whey), which is drained off. The remaining curd is then re-cooked to 120? F which expels even more moisture, allowing for the production of a firm-textured cheese. The curd is then packed into a hoop that is lined with cheesecloth, and pressed for three hours before being brined. After brining, the young cheeses are left to dry for several days and transferred to aging caves where they mature for at least 10 months at a temperature of 50?F before release. The texture of Rupert is smooth and firm and golden yellow in color. The exterior rind is beige-brown and relatively thin. Flavors are rich, with toasty and buttery notes and a hint of sharpness, punctuated with delicate crystalline nuggets."
Rush Creek Reserve,Uplands Cheese,United States,Wisconsin,"4 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",1 lb,www.uplandscheese.com,Cow,Raw,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Made by Andy Hatch at Uplands Cheese in southern Wisconsin, Rush Creek Reserve is a washed rind, raw cow`s milk cheese made in the style of France`s Vacherin Mont d`Or. The original vision for Uplands Cheese was as a collaboration between Mike & Carol Gingrich and their business partners, Dan and Jeanne Patenaude. Having had a successful career in the corporate world with Xerox, Mike decided to realize a long-held ambition to create a farmstead cheese operation modeled after the traditional practices found in the French Alps. Together they acquired a farm in southern Wisconsin in the mid 1990`s and immediately set to work to improve the quality of the pasture, which was sown with specific varieties of grasses, clovers, herbs and wild flowers. The 150 cows at Uplands deliberately consist of a variety of well-known milking breeds and carefully crossed genetics with a view to producing the highest possible quality of milk. The farm incorporates rotational grazing by creating 20 separate pastures on their 244 acre farm. In 2007, cheesemaker Andy Hatch joined the team and has now taken over responsibility for the cheesemaking as well as acquisition of the business. Dan and Jeanne are now retired, having left a great legacy of the very high quality milking herd that still provides 100% of the milk for cheese production. The cheese for which Uplands became known is Pleasant Ridge Reserve. Modeled closely after French Beaufort from the Jura region, Pleasant Ridge has won multiple awards including being the three times Best in Show winner at the Annual American Cheese Society competition. However, in the autumn of 2010, Andy decided to launch a new cheese, Rush Creek Reserve. Rush Creek takes its inspiration from Vacherin Mont d’Or, a wonderful, seasonal cheese made in the Jura region of France - the same area as Beaufort. Traditional Beaufort is only made during the summer months when the cows are grazing on high altitude pasture. In the fall, when the cows come down to the lower slopes, the cheesemakers switch production to make Vacherin Mont d’Or from the fall and early winter milk. This milk is naturally high in protein and solids and is particularly suited to production of softer cheese. So, for the same reasons, Andy decided that Rush Creek Reserve would be a natural companion to Pleasant Ridge Reserve. Rush Creek is made only between September and November each year. Cheeses are produced from fresh, raw, warm, evening milk gently pumped directly into the cheese vat from the milking parlor. After the cultures and rennet are added and the curd is set, Hatch cuts and stirs the large curd by hand—using no mechanical agitators—to protect its delicate texture. He hand-ladles the curd into forms, where it sets briefly, is flipped, and then is drained overnight. The next morning the 12-ounce wheels are brined and hand-wrapped with spruce bark that’s been first boiled, then soaked in a potion of yeast and molds. This colonizes the bark with bacteria that helps ripen the cheese. Disks are then transferred to a series of maturing rooms where they remain for at least two months prior to release. During this time they are also washed with a mother culture—a mixture of brine, yeasts, and bacteria, including Brevibacterium linens—which results from washing Pleasant Ridge. Hatch explains; “We wash the big wheels of Pleasant Ridge first to capture the bacteria from those rinds in the solution. Then we wash the Rush Creek wheels with the same solution and transfer the bacteria. Our purpose is to really express the milk and the wash reinforces that.” Soft and luxuriant, Rush Creek Reserve is not designed for slicing. Like Vacherin Mont d’Or, it is meant to be served slightly warmed with its thin top rind removed so a spoon or bit of bread can be dipped into the cheese.This cheese, with its rippling pink surface lightly dusted with white, is positively striking. Rich, salty, and savory, flavors of smoked and cured meat dominate, with notes of sour cream and grass in the background.We love Rush Creek Reserve alongside roasted and starchy foods; think french fries, roasted Brussels sprouts, warmed apples wrapped in bacon or pancetta, or rosemary potatoes. For drink pairings, try a sweet, woody bourbon, a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned. A Belgian Tripel would work nicely, too."
Rustico Limone,Sini Family,Italy,Viterbo,"7 ins diameter, 4-5 ins high",4 lbs,,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Flavor Added,,,"Made in the style of a pecorino, Rustico Limone is produced by the Sini family at Nepi, in the province of Viterbo, Italy. Sheep’s milk for production is sourced from the Lazio region, an area renowned for its high quality milk. Upon reaching the cheesemaking facility, it is pasteurized prior to coagulation. However, what sets Rustico Limone apart, is the addition of delicate pieces of candied lemon peel to the curd. Wheels are matured for a minimum of forty days befor release. This non-traditional concept was the creation of the cheesemaker who sought a flavor to compliment the natural sweetness and high butterfat of the sheep’s milk. The resulting flavors are rich and sheepy, with a full, cream-like mouthfeel cut with the gentle citrus acidity of the lemon. There are also notes of hay and herbs."

There`s a reason this octagonal wheel from France`s volcanic central Auvergne region is found around the world. Produced since 1988 of France, Saint Agur is an irresistibly buttery double-cream cheese speckled with spicy blue veins. Its maker, Savencia Fromage & Dairy, dates back to 1920 in Illoud, France. That`s when founder Jean-Noel Bongrain, then only 19 years of age, inherited the small family business of Fromagerie d’Illoud (as it was then called). By the early 1950s, Bongrain developed the family business in a new direction, seeking to break away from traditional French cheeses. His vision was to produce a nationally-branded cheese, an idea that was unheard of at the time in France.The first cheese to be made along these lines was Caprice des Dieux, first produced in 1956. Having penetrated the French market, Bongrain then launched further afield, and by 1960 was selling cheese in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Today Savencia Fromage & Dairy is one of France’s largest cheese and dairy producers, operating production facilities in 24 countries around the world. Over time, Saint Agur has become one of the most popular cheeses in France, as well as a hit in the UK. Each five-pound octagonal wheel requires about five gallons of cow’s milk for production and contains 60 percent buttercream, thus qualifying it a double-cream cheese.The interior paste of the cheese is moist, dense and yielding, with a pale cream-colored paste and characteristic blue-green veins of mold. Flavors are rich and buttery with a spicy tang.Pair it with a chardonnay, a syrah, or a port."

Sainte Maure de Touraine,Various,France,"Touraine, Loire Valley","1.5 ins diameter, 5-6 ins long",8 oz,,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Ash coatedMold Ripened,,,"The Loire Valley, in France is famous for its production of high quality goat`s cheese and St. Maure is a classic Loire Valley chèvre, made in the shape of a small log with a stick of straw running horizontally through its middle.The method of production for this cheese is still very traditional. Milk is heated to 62°-68°F and coagulated for 24 hours before being ladled into long, cylindrical molds and drained naturally. The cheese is then removed from the mold and a long straw inserted, designed to hold the fragile cheese together and ventilate its interior.The cheese is then covered with salted, powdered charcoal and laid on a board to complete drainage. Affinage takes between ten days, and three to four weeks, within AOC specified areas. Production of the cheese may be fermier, artisanal or cooperative and takes place at one of approximately 50 local farmhouses, together with a handful of co-ops.During maturation cheeses are turned every day in a well-ventilated, cool cellar at 50°-59°F with 90% humidity. At ten days of age, cheeses have a pale yellow rind with no mold development. At this stage, the paste is still soft and has a pronounced tang. However, during the third week, a blue mold forms on the rind, which has now become drier. The paste also changes and becomes drier, denser and smooth.The paste of St. Maure can range from semisoft and moist, when fresh and young, to dense and firm when older.With a young cheese, flavors remain young and acidic with citrus notes. With age, flavors intensify and become more nutty and salty, but nevertheless delicious.A perfect companion to Fumé Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, and Sancerre."
Saint-Felicien,Various,France,Rhône-Alpes,"3.5-4.5 in diameter, 1 in height",4.5 - 6.5 oz,,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Saint-Félicien is a soft cheese made from cow’s milk and cream. It ages for 2-6 weeks, developing a bloomy rind and a natural golden-beige color. Because the creamy and delicate paste can become runny, it’s sometimes sold in a small ceramic crock or in a wooden box. Saint-Félicien is considered a dauphinois cheese, which refers to the former French province of Dauphine in which it was born. Today it’s made in the Haute-Ardeche area of the Rhône-Alpes region. It’s quite is similar to another dauphinois cheese, the more common Saint-Marcellin, however the Saint-Félicien is slightly fattier and creamier, and can be larger in diameter.Like Saint-Marcellin, Saint-Félicien is a soft, gentle and highly accessible cheese. Its softness is due to the hand-scooped, uncooked and unpressed curd during fabrication, as well as the occasional addition of cream. It is creamy, buttery, slightly tart, and nutty.Because Saint-Félicien is so mild, it works well as the introductory cheese on a cheese plate. Pair it with light and fruity wines that can enhance the soft flavors of the cheese; a Côtes du Rhône (Crozes-Hermitage, Vacqueyras) or a Beaujolais (Brouilly, Morgon)."

Since 1961, the name and production process of Salers has been protected in France by an Appellation d’Origine Controllé, or AOC label. The Appellation requires that producers follow strict guidelines in making the cheese; milk must be unpasteurized, with a standardized fat and protein content, and transformed immediately after milking. The cheese can only be produced from April 15 to November 15, when cows are grazing on fresh grass. Milk is collected in a wooden container called a gerlo, which itself plays an important role in the production process, transferring microflora to the raw milk. During production the cheesemaker cuts the curd manually using a tool called the fréniale, removes the whey, and forms and presses the curd into a flat block called a tome. The tome is left to mature for several hours to encourage the development of lactic acid bacteria, after which it’s passed through a curd mill that breaks it into small pieces. Salt is added and mixed in, and the mixture is left for a few hours to rest. Finally, the tome is packed manually into Salers’ characteristic mold, a cylindershape with two bulges at the top and bottom, and pressed again. Maturation, which can last anywhere from three months to two years, includes regular turning and brushing with cloth to encourage the development of a natural rind.When ready for sale, Salers has a golden rind that sometimes shows traces of red and orange, and a yellow, consistent paste.

Salers Tradition,Various,France,Auvergne,,70-85 lbs,www.salers.org,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Salers Tradition is a specific type of Salers, which is an uncooked, pressed farmstead cheese produced in the mountainous volcanic region of Auvergne, central France.

The Appellation requires that producers follow strict guidelines in making the cheese; milk must be unpasteurized, with a standardized fat and protein content, and transformed immediately after milking. AOC guidelines do not, however, require that the milk come from any particular breed of cow. But according to the 10 or so producers who still use the local Salers breed, this is one of the most important aspects of producing the authentic cheese. As a result, the producers using only Salers breed milk have created the Salers Tradition label. The breed, which is russet-colored and has distinctive curved horns, produces only a small quantity of high-quality milk. Salers cows are unique in their maternal instinct; they can’t be milked at all unless they’re stimulated by their young offspring. So the calf always needs to be next to the mom while she’s being milked. This makes milking more time-consuming for the farmer, but it also allows the mother to stay near her young, and the milk, according to producers, is perfect for making Salers. The cheese can only be produced from April 15 to November 15, when cows are grazing on fresh grass. Milk is collected in a wooden container called a gerlo, which itself plays an important role in the production process, transferring microflora to the raw milk.

Having raised a family and had a career as a nurse, in the early 1990`s Cindy Callahan made the decision to change direction, starting a sheep farm. Although initially focused on lamb production, the Callahans were encouraged to develop their sheep into a milking herd. This, combined with a trip to Italy where they had the opportunity to taste many local sheep`s milk cheeses inspired them to start to experiment with cheesemaking. The sheep at Bellwether Farm consist mainly of East Friesian ewes. The ewes give birth to between one and three lambs each year and the lambs stay with their mother for 45 days before the ewe joins the milking line. Each ewe gives, on average, slightly less than one gallon a day and they are milked for eight months before the cycle begins again. The sheep graze freely year round in addition to being given grain and alfalfa as necessary. Cindy`s Callahan son Liam oversees cheese production while his wife Diana manages the office and Cindy focuses on taking care of the sheep. San Andreas is made from raw milk and, although based on an Italian Pecorino, is a Bellwether original. The interior paste is smooth, with a few small holes or ""eyes"" and it is pale ivory-straw in color. Flavors are rich with notes of butterscotch, nuts and hay.

Founded by Fredolino Lafranchi in 1919, Lafranchi Ranch, was a dream come true for the Swiss immigrant who arrived in the U.S. at the age of 17. The ranch became a family operation years later when Will Lafranchi, Fredolino’s eldest son took over running the business. Throughout this period, family connections to Switzerland remained strong and Will, along with his family, visited many times. These visits were filled with locally produced food, including artisanal cheeses at every meal. Inspired by his experiences in the old country, Will dreamed of producing great cheese on his ranch. Unfortunately, Will was unable to achieve this dream during his lifetime, but his children who now run the ranch, founded Nicasio Valley Cheese Company. Nicasio Valley Cheese focuses on bringing cheeses inspired by their family heritage to the U.S. Using rotational grazing for their herd of 400 cows and sustainable practices throughout the ranch, 100% of their herd is certified organically raised and their milk is used for the production of cheese. The creamery is located in a converted milking barn and recycled shipping containers are used as the aging rooms. Created in 2011, San Geronimo is a washed-rind cheese aged for around 6 weeks. During its production, the cheese-maker uses a technique called curd washing, where the whey is replaced with water, which reduces the acidity of the cheese and creates a mild flavor. As the cheese matures, it is washed in a brine solution, which causes the thin rind to develop a deep yellow to light orange color and distinct meaty-earthy aroma. The rind can subsequently be a bit tacky to the touch.Under that rind is a light butter colored paste that delivers a big aroma, similar to that of the rind. The flavor though is mild, rather like a custard, with a bit of salt and a tart tang. San Geronimo pairs very well with beer, dry white wine and cider. The flavor of San Geronimo is similar to Raclette, which, when combined with its ability to melt beautifully makes it an ideal substitute for the famous French/Swiss cheese in recipes. "

The Fiscalini family, along with cheesemaker Mariano Gonzalez, produce a small range of farmstead cow`s milk cheeses, including a traditional, cloth wrapped, English-style cheddar, and San Joaquin Gold, which is another aged cheese made to their own recipe.Fiscalini is relatively large-scale in terms of its herd size, although not all the milk is used for cheese production. The farm is home to some 3,000 Holstein cows, of which 1,500 are milked. The remainder are heifers (youngsters) waiting to join the main herd. Cows are housed in, and roam freely around well-ventilated barns that are designed to catch cross breezes. The cows stand on thick, rubber floor mats that are softer on the their legs, and create a buffer between the animals` feet and the concrete floor. They are fed a total mixed ration (TMR) of various grains and hay rather than feeding on pasture.John Fiscalini and his staff pay a great deal of attention to the welfare of their cows, which results in good quality milk.Mariano was formerly head cheesemaker at Shelburne Farms, and developed his first cloth wrapped cheddar there. Now in Modesto, Mariano makes his raw milk cheddars using traditional methods, and ages them for at least 16 months before they are released in limited quantities.Cheese production takes place five days a week, using around 1,000 gallons of milk for each batch.San Joaquin Gold is named after the San Joaquin Valley of Central California. Naturally, the climate is extremely dry, but the valley was brought to life with the arrival of irrigation in the early 1900`s, which has allowed for the explosion of agriculture in the valley.Produced from the milk of Fiscalini`s herd of registered Holsteins, San Joaquin Gold is made in 32lb. wheels, with a cow imprint stamped into the top rind of each wheel.Made in the style of a Fontina, but with more salt and a firmer texture, the flavors are mild and buttery, with notes of earth, caramel and salt.

San Simon,Queixeria Fontelas,Spain,Galicia,"5 ins diameter, 5-6 ins high",3-4 lbs,,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Smoked,,,"San Simon is a tasty, not so well-known cow’s milk cheese from the region of Galicia, in Northeastern Spain. The origins of the cheese are not wholly known; some believe the cheese dates back to Roman times while others say it was developed at the beginning of the 20th century. Either way, San Simon increased in popularity over the last seventy years. Until the 1980’s, cheeses were most often produced by housewives, using the milk from their own cows, frequently the Galician Blonde breed. The production process is very labor intensive, often with an output per person of only two or three cheeses each day. After being removed from their molds, the cheeses would be cured for a few days in a well ventilated room before being cold smoked, one by one, over green birch wood until they reached the traditional ochre color. Cheeses were sold mostly to cheese traders during scheduled fairs taking place in the Vilalba region. The early 1980’s saw a sharp decline in the production of San Simon partly due to the work involved with production but also because milk prices reached an all time high, making it more profitable for the farmers to sell their milk to larger cheese manufacturers. However, with the advent of name protected status for San Simon in 1990, cheese production has once again seen an upswing to the point where the cheese is now exported to several countries, the US included. Although San Simon is now made in several creameries, this particular version is produced at Queixeria Fontelas in the village of DaCosta de San Simon by third generation San Simon producer Javier Pineiro, his wife Sonia and two employees. With the exception of using pasteurized milk, Javier and his team follow traditional methods of production. The milk is sourced from local dairies and, after the curd is formed it is transferred to the unique San Simon molds or forms, from which the cheese gets it conical shape. After unmolding, the cheeses are pressed manually for three hours in order to extract the correct amount of whey. At this point, the new cheeses are carefully trimmed by hand – unlike most others who rely solely on the mold and machinery. They like to take off the nubs and cut away a certain amount at the base so as to differentiate each wheel from an industrial version. Cheeses spend about 1-1.5 hours in the smoker and are still smoked over green birch branches after which they are matured for approximately two months prior to release. The exterior of the cheese is a rich ochre color while the interior paste is semi-firm and smooth with occasional holes and pale yellow in color. Flavors are fairly mild and sweetly earthy with tastes of butter and delicate smoke. San Simon pairs very well with a pale, dry or even semi-dry sherry."

São Jorge,Various,Portugal,Azores,Varies,16-25 lbs,,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"The island of São Jorge, from which this cheese gets its name, is located 900 miles from the west coast of Portugal and is part of the Azores archipelago. Discovered in the 15th century by the Flemish, the islands have long been of strategic importance in terms of oceanic navigation. As a result, Azoreans developed a brisk trade with passing merchant ships, the crews of which sought food for their long voyages. Situated in the middle of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, the Azores has a mild, damp climate and, due to its volcanic geology, a richly fertile soil that supports abundant vegetation. All these factors contribute to favorable conditions for dairying—the island is home to 20,000 dairy cows—and cheesemaking. Azorean cheesemaking on the island dates back to when settlers migrated from the Netherlands and various other regions in mainland Europe, bringing with them both livestock and cheesemaking knowledge. The Azores have traditionally been home to a variety of cheeses. These range from fresher styles, designed to be eaten within a few days of production, to more robust, aged cheeses able to withstand the rigors of transportation—and consequently often sold to ships’ crews to sustain them for many months at sea. Made from raw cow’s milk, São Jorge cheese falls into this second category. It is the largest of the Portuguese cheeses weighing between 16 and 26 pounds, and is aged for between three and seven months before release. To make the cooked-curd, pressed cheese, cows are milked twice a day and the evening milk gets delivered to the cheese plant about 8:30pm with cheesemaking commencing right away, continuing through the night from about 9 pm to 4 am. Then, after morning milking another round of cheese is made. Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status is awarded to cheeses matured for a minimum of 90 days, although usually wheels of São Jorge are released at three, four and seven months. As a side note, São Jorge is so beloved that many Portuguese and Azorean immigrant cheesemakers in the U.S. make their own version as a tribute to their homeland. The most well-known of these are fifth-generation cheesemakers from São Jorge, Joe and Mary Matos, of California’s Matos Cheese Factory near Santa Rosa, an hour north of San Francisco.São Jorge cheeses have a firm, slightly waxy texture with a straw-colored paste dotted with small eyes (holes). Flavors are mild, yet full and buttery, with an underlying tang that becomes more pronounced with age. Aromas are rich and aromatic.São Jorge works well as a table cheese or added to everyday dishes where a tangy, robust flavor is desired.A full bodied red wine such as Port or a Madeira wine pair wonderfully with São Jorge."
Sappy Ewe,Nettle Meadow Farm and Artisan Cheese,United States,New York,2.5 in diameter x 2 in height,5 oz,www.nettlemeadow.com,SheepCow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Mold RipenedAshed,,Flavor added to paste," We couldn’t paint a prettier rind; Sappy Ewe’s juxtaposition of black pine ash and white mold is a true work of art. With maple reduction-infused cow’s and sheep’s milk curds, this little button yields a flavor that mellows into maple sweetness while the rind contributes savory, mushroomy notes.  The woodsy cheese appropriately hails from near the Adirondak Mountains of New York, on a dairy run by Sheila Flanagan and Lorraine Lambiase. Nettle Meadow’s origins date back to 1993, when Raynald Hebert and his wife Laurie Goodheart transformed an old farmstead into a small cheesemaking facility and enough acreage to support approximately thirty goats. Its name was a reflection of the wild nettles and herbs that made up the goats’ diet.  Twelve years after its founding, the farm was sold to Sheila and Lorraine, both of whom had been living in California and were seeking a complete change of direction. Since 2005 they have worked extensively to expand the operation. Now spanning 75 acres, it is home to over 360 Alpine, Nubian, Saanen and mixed breed goats, several dozen East Freisian sheep and a variety of other farm animals currently cared for by the farm’s sanctuary. In 2017, estimated cheese production will be about 150,000 pounds of cheese. Sheila and Lorraine are passionate supporters of the farming lifestyle, the human care of animals and artisan cheese and run the farm with the assistance of Shiela’s mother Joan together with eighteen employees.  To make Sappy Ewe, cheesemakers reduce maple syrup while the milk is pasteurizing, and then let it cool while the curd is setting. They then drain the curds and add them to the reduced maple before letting them soak for a half hour. The curds and maple are poured into molds and left to set overnight. Young rounds are then rubbed in a layer of pine ash, and left for a few weeks as a thin layer of bloomy rind begins to grow.Exuding aromas of sweet mold and slate with a hint of damp woods and moss, Sappy Ewe yields hints of grass, mushrooms, bagel dough and light maple on the palate. As sweetness fades, umami notes from the rind linger. This cheese is more crumbly than creamy, so a sticky marmalade really pulls it all together. A bright, zingy lemon marmalade is really fantastic, especially with a sweet, nutty biscuit. Try the Lemon Coal marmalade from STAGG Jam & Marmalade and an Effie`s oatcake.   For beverages, try a malty beer with a kiss of hops; Bocks, März, and Belgian pale ales are absolutely delightful. Fortified wine is a winner with any sheep milk cheese, especially younger ones with such a full nutty flavor. Spring for Oloroso sherry. "
Sarabande,Dancing Cow Farm,United States,Vermont ,"3 ins square base, 2 ins sq top",6oz, www.dancingcowcheese.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Sarabande is made by Steve and Karen Getz at Dancing Cow Farm, near Bridport, Vermont, from the milk of their own herd of cows. The farm is a pasture-based dairy. No pesticides, herbicides or petroleum-based products are used on the fields. The cows graze on clovers, dandelion, trefoil, and a variety of grasses. The animals live outside during the grazing season, occasionally taking a break in the shade of the barn on hot, humid summer days. The Getzs make their own hay, and after composting the cow manure, spread it on the fields. Milking and cheesemaking are seasonal and take place from March to November when the cows are either grazing on pasture or being fed dry hay. Milk for cheesemaking is uncooled and transferred directly into the cheese room from the milking parlor - the perfect temperature to begin the cheese production process. Dancing Cow Farm produces four cheeses; Bourrée, Menuet, Sarabande and Lindy Hop. Named after a Spanish dance, Sarabande is a small, washed rind, truncated pyramid and is made from early July through to the Fall. The texture of Sarabande is very smooth and velvety just under the rind, becoming more chalky towards the center. Flavors are of caramel, grass, hay and butter. Despite the washed rind, the aroma is quite subtle and not very pungent."

During the summer, cow`s and goat`s milk is mixed 50/50, while during the winter months cow`s and sheep`s milk (from the rare ""frabosana"" breed of sheep) are used to give the cheeses a sweetr, less intense flavor.Cheeses are made in the high Alpine pastures of the Pellice Valley, between 1,900 - 7,200 feet, to a recipe that has been in existence for many hundreds of years. Depending on the cheesemaker, the cheeses vary slightly from place to place and season to season.The external coat of green hay is cut from the same pastures where the animals graze and occasionally some thyme finds its way into the mix. Traditionally, the hay was introduced as a wrap to protct the cheeses from their bumpy ride down the hillside.To make Saras del fen, whey left over from the production of ""toma"" cheese is used. The whey is heated to 158 F before a small quantity of milk is added - usually 10-15% of the total. The mix is then heated up to 194 F and the solids separate from the whey, rising to the surface, where they are skimmed off.These delicate curds are lightly salted and placed in linen draining bags for 24 hours. The cheeses are then removed from their bags, salted again and wrapped in a thin coat of hay which has been carefully dried and prepared, before being matured for at least one week.The texture of Saras is very fine and semi-soft. Although the color of the interior paste varies slightly depending on the mix of milks used, it ranges from ivory to pale yellow.Aging for Saras del fen varies from between one week to one month. It can be eaten either fresh or more matured, both for eating or as an ingredient in cooking. Its traditional to use it as a seasoning or as a dessert served with blueberry jam or honey."
Sarró de Cabra,Formatges Montbrú,Spain,Catalonia,,2.2 lbs,montbru.com,Goat,Pasteurised,Firm,,Natural,,,"Boasting a musty blue-gray rind reminiscent of glossy wet stone that encases a dense, bone-white paste, this aged Spanish goat’s milk cheese is absolutely striking. Maker Oriol Antúnez lives on his family farm in Catalonia, where his parents, Pere Antúnez and Inmaculada Llonch, began raising goats in the mid-1980s and experimenting with cheesemaking in their kitchen. Eventually the couple built a small production facility in their old stone home, in a cavernous room carved into a hillside that once housed the cistern. Six years ago, the family moved production to a much larger, modern facility on the outskirts of Moià—and Oriol began expanding the product line, driven by a desire to experiment with new styles. While Oriol works with several types of milk, some of his classic cheeses utilize goat’s milk from the family farm. This one, Sarró de Cabra, is wrapped in cheesecloth into a traditional servilleta shape when fresh; as it ages, it sproutsa blue-gray rind similar to that of traditional Catalan garrotxa.With stone cellar vibes on the nose and a slightly waxy aroma, Sarró de Cabra yields sharp, lemon-goat flavors that develop slowly on the palate, layered with hints of herbs. Minerals linger in the aftertaste of the firm-but-creamy paste.This cheese goes gangbusters with noci verdi candite—an Italian condiment made from chewy green walnuts preserved in syrup. With the tangy-sweet goat’s milk cheese, the pairing is like candy."

The herd size at each farm averages 75 cows and many of the farms have worked with Sartori for multiple generations. The company also operates an incentive program that encourages each farm to produce the best quality milk possible.For production of Sartori’s cheeses, the milk is heated, cultures and rennet are added and, once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut, releasing the whey which is drained off.The remaining curd is hand-salted and transferred into hoops and then pressed for several hours. After that,the newly formed wheels of cheese are placed in a warm “overnight” room to encourage the expulsion of more whey. Wheels are then trimmed by hand and placed in a brine bath which encourages the formation of a rind. After the brine bath, the cheese is moved to a curing room for further maturation.Each variety of cheese is matured for a different length of time. Every batch is tasted at regular intervals during this period and, when they are deemed ready, released for sale.Sartori’s SarVecchio Parmesan is made from cow’s milk and aged a minimum of 20 months prior to release.Subtle flavors of fruit are replaced by deeper, richer notes of caramel, toasted nuts and brown butter.  The texture is slightly softer than many grating cheeses, making the cheese accessible either as a table cheese or for use in the kitchen.Good wine pairings include Sherry, Port and Chianti, while dark malty ales, IPA’s and sweeter Ciders also work well."

Scamorza - Smoked (Maplebrook Farm),Maplebrook Farm,United States,Vermont,"5 ins long, 3 ins diameter",1.5 lbs,www.maplebrookvt.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Smoked,,,"Maplebrook Farm was founded in 2003 after a chance encounter. Founder, Johann Englert, came across Al Ducci`s Groceria in Manchester, Vermont during a visit and when she tasted their mozzarella, it transported her back to her time in Italy during college. Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lives. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today, Maplebrook Farm is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. It employs around 20 cheesemakers, who are each trained in old world cheesemaking techniques. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Mike still is the head cheesemaker for the majority of their cheeses, but as of 2010 now has help from Domenico Marchitelli, who makes the Burrata and Scamorza. Domenico hails from Puglia, Italy, the birthplace of Burrata.Smoked Scamorza is a dried Mozzarella that is then smoked for added flavor. It is made by producing a fresh Mozzarella ball, which is then tied about 2/3 of the way toward the top, creating a pear-shaped cheese. It is hung to dry and then smoked over Cherry wood. This creates a slightly sweet smoked flavor to the now firm, friable cheese.While the Smoked Scamorza can be used in the same dishes as Mozzarella, it is also can be grilled on its own, making it a great cheese to use in cookouts as a side dish. With the smoky flavor, it pairs nicely with off-dry white and rose wines. It also works well with earthy, and fruit forward red wines such as Pinot Noir."
Scamorza - Smoked (The Mozzarella Company),The Mozzarella Company,United States,Texas,"3 ins diameter, 4 ins high",1 lb,www.mozzco.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Smoked,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),Smoked,"Located in Dallas, Texas, the Mozzarella Company was founded by Paula Lambert in 1982. Paula’s passion for all things Italian was the inspiration for the Company’s creation, although when the company started in the early 80’s, it was somewhat ahead of its time in terms of being able to find a ready market for fresh Italian style mozzarella. However, persistence together with great products really paid off and The Mozzarella Company has grown steadily and expanded over the intervening decades. Today, still under the guidance of Paula, they produce a range of fresh and young, Italian style cheeses, one of which is this Smoked Scamorza. Paula’s inspiration for this cheesecomes from Italy, where shespent time at a small cheese factory near Perugiaduringthe early and mid 1980’s. It was there that she firstlearned to make fresh mozzarella and subsequently Smoked Scamorza using traditional methods. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized and starter cultures and microbial rennet are added. Once the milk has coagulated, the curd is cut and gently stirred allowing the release of some of the whey and leaving smaller pieces of curd in the vat. The curds are allowed to “ripen” for a short while before hot water is poured over them and the cutting and stirring resume. This causes the curds to shrink and become firmer in texture. They are then left for several hours to mature in the whey during which time the curds naturally start to knit together. Once the curds have reached the correct pH and texture, they’re cut by hand with curd knives and hot water is once again poured over them while they are being stretched and worked in the vat using a small paddle. Each Scamorza is formed by breaking a piece weighting about 12oz off the stretched curd, shaping and squeezing it into a ball and creating the traditional top knot. Each newly formed cheese is then tossed into cold water in order to chill them down and firm-up the texture before being placed in a brine solution. The next step is to place a small noose made of raffia around the “neck” of the cheese and transfer them to an aging room where they are left to dry for a couple of days. At this stage, cheeses destined for smoking are selected. Originally, Paula used hickory chips for smoking but, at the suggestion of a visitor who arrived at the creamery armed with a quantity of pecan shells, she switched over, much preferring the flavor. As well as imparting a true Southern type nuance, the Pecan Tree is the state tree of Texas, which makes it particularly appropriate. The Scamorzas are finally dipped in wax which helps them to retain their moisture and fairly intense smoky flavor and, if desired, effectively allows them to be aged for up to several months. However, the majority of cheeses are normally released at between 1 and 3 weeks old.The flavor of Smoked Scamorza is gently smoked with a sweet, light caramel note and pleasing finish. The texture is elastic and delivers a satisfying mouthfeel.Scamorza melts beautifully when heated and is equally good sliced and served on salads and sandwiches. It pairs very well with an oak-aged Chardonnay."

She was inspired early on by watching her grandfather Joe, who had taken over Alphonso’s shop, making mozzarella, ricotta and basket cheese. Her business in Somerville, Massachusetts, whose name translates into “my grandfather’s flower,” is a salute to him. Lourdes sources mozzarella curd from partner farms. She recently worked with Shy Brothers Farm in Westport, MA, which is run by two sets of fraternal twins, to develop a curd recipe using their antibiotic and hormone-free cow’s milk. Shy Brothers’ cows graze on pasture in a peninsula that juts out into the Westport River. After Lourdes receives the curd, she transforms it by hand each morning in her Somerville, MA kitchen. The cheesemaking process begins by breaking the curd into even pieces using a tool called a guitar. Lourdes then adds hot water to the curd, which slowly brings it up to melting temperature so that it can be stretched using a wooden paddle, then shaped.Available only during winter, Fiore di Nonno’s Scamorza is a version of mozzarella that’s been hung for three to five days, losing moisture and forming into its unique shape.

They’d purchased their first goat Grace at the Fryeburg fair in 2007, only so that Cara’s horse wouldn’t be too lonely in the barn. “We just got goat with the most blue ribbons” remembers Devin, “we were just like, we want the one with the floppy ears! And the big nose!” After Cara’s horse Petey passed away in 2008, Grace was devastated, so they got another doe, Ruth, to keep her company. The experience of raising goats, especially kidding, led Cara to change the course of her life; she’s now the husbandry manager of her and Devin’s herd of more than 35. She’s also in veterinary school, conducting research on a poorly understood Nubian goat genetic disease known as the G6S mutation, sampling goat populations throughout New England. Devin, a lover of food and cooking, has become the farmstead cheesemaker after working to convert the basement of the house into a fully operational creamery. Goats are milked twice daily and cheese is made up to several times per week in season. In the future Cara and Devin hope to work with local cow dairies to produce cow’s milk cheeses and blended cheeses year-round. To produce Scapegoat, Devin slices open fresh rounds of cheese and sandwiches in a layer of puréed local garlic scapes.The scapes contribute a snap to the bite and added freshness to the light, fluffy and slightly tangy cheese. Garlic flavor is noticeable but doesn’t overwhelm, merging harmoniously with the chevre’s creaminess.Pair it with a slightly acidic and herbal white wine, such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a Chenin Blanc."

Schabziger is something of an acquired taste.Records of the cheese`s production date back to the 8th century when it was first manufactured by the monks of Glarus. However, the recipe was formally laid down in 1463 when it was decreed that in order to be called Schabziger, it had to be marked with a stamp. This makes it one of the earliest protected name cheeses in existence.For production, the milk is heated to 194 F (90 C) at which point acidity is introduced to the vat to cause the mixture to curdle (similar to ricotta production). The curd is removed and pressed into cones to drain. After unmolding, the cheeses are matured for between 4-12 weeks and dried before being ground into a powder, mixed with salt and then matured for a further 8 month in silos.At this point the expensive blue fenugreek is added which results in a sage-like flavor and pale lime color. The mixture is pressed into molds to become hard 3oz. (85 gram) cones, called ""stockli"", which are wrapped in silver foil.Traditionally, Schabziga is either grated over food or grated and mixed with butter to produce a paste which is then spread onto bread or crackers."

Each dairy produces its very own, unique cheeses. However, when it comes to marketing and selling them, they join forces, marketing them collectively with a regional identity.Milk is sourced from cows fed only fresh grass or natural hay and is delivered direct from the dairies to the cheesemaking facility.After heating the milk and adding cultures and rennet, the curd is cut and then re-heated to a higher temperature to expel the whey. The curds are then scooped into cheese molds and pressed. Twenty four hours after unmolding, the newly formed wheels are placed in a brine bath which aids in the formation of a rind.The wheels of Scharfe Maxx are then transferred to maturing cellars where they are held for at least five months prior to release. During this time they are washed and flipped regulary to allow for even maturation throughout each wheel.With a dense, smooth and firm texture, flavors are robust and meaty.  Notes of nuts, onions and bacon are usual and the cheese has excellent melting qualities.Good pairings include full bodied, robust red wines, ambers and brown ales."
Schloss,Marin French Cheese,United States,California,4 in diameter x 1 in height,8 oz,www.marinfrenchcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the MarinFrench Cheese Company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. To make the cheese, cow`s milk is pasteurized and poured into `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.) With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. The cheeses are unmolded and brined, then placed on racks to dry before they’re transferred to the aging rooms where they will spend 10-14 days before release. The cheeses are turned once during this time to promote mold growth. Austrian-inspired Schloss (which translates into ‘castle’ in German) has been produced by Marin French Cheese since 1901. Made from pasteurized cow’s milk and a dollop of cream, discs of the triple crème cheese are aged for five months. They’re repeatedly washed in brine, developing an orange-hued rind, then packaged in wooden cups.Schloss has a distinctly hoppy aroma with notes of sour cream. Texture is contrasting, with a creamy middle and a chalkier outside underneath a thick, sticky rind. Flavor is pungent, meaty and earthy with a slight tang; complex layers bring to mind citrus, brandy and an ocean breeze at the same time.Pair Schloss with a hearty California red wine or an aromatic white wine.Or simply serve it alongsidebeer, pickled vegetables and salumi."

The company is known for pioneering the use of “cheese pods,” affordable, transportable cheesemaking facilities built into refurbished shipping containers. Recently Mystic Cheese has also opened a brick-and-mortar retail shop in Groton, Connecticut, one of the two towns in which the village of mystic is located.   In 2017 the company spruced up its stracchino-style Sea Change by giving it a blue rind. To produce the cheese, makers add a homemade mild yogurt culture to pasteurized milk and wait until its pH drops to a desired level of souring. After firming up, the curd is broken down into one-inch cubes, which are mixed gently before being formed into square molds. The fermentation and turning of the squares continues in a warm room—“cue the C+C music factory,” Civitello says—for eight hours. Once cooled and dry salted, they’re ready to be sprayed with a cocktail of yeasts that set the stage for the blue. (Makers don’t add any blue spores because the ripening room contains other blue cheeses whose molds spread to Sea Change). The squares then age in a shipping pod aging room for three weeks.The end result has a mesmerizing rind full of layered blue and white molds, juxtaposed with a dense, gooey, creamy paste. Smelling salty and damp like a cave on a jetty, it yields notes of hops and mushroom confit on the palate.Co-founder Jason Sobocinski offers a pairing tip: “I snacked on some Sea Change last night on a cocoa biscuit with some strawberry jam,” he says, “and it made the world right for a few moments.”"
SeaHive,Beehive Cheese Company,United States,Utah,"12-14 ins diameter, 3 ins high",18 lbs,www.beehivecheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Flavored,,,"Founded in 2005 by brothers-in-law Tim Welsh and Pat Ford, Beehive Cheese Company is located at the mouth of the Weber Canyon near Uintah in UT - about half an hour north of Salt Lake City. They are one of the few artisanal cheesemakers in Utah. Having previously worked in the worlds of software and real estate, both men harbored a belief in revitalizing the concept of the local creamery. With the help of The Western Dairy Center at Utah State University, they began to turn their vision into reality. Pat and Tim built the family owned and operated creamery from the ground up. Jersey cow’s milk, known for its high butterfat content, is sourced from Wadeland South Dairy, located about 10 miles from the creamery. The milk arrives from Wadeland at about midnight when it’s just a few hours old. Cheesemaking begins almost immemdiately, starting with pasteurization and the addition of starter cultures. After being left to ‘ripen’, microbial rennet is added to coagulate the milk, which is then hand cut. The excess whey is drained off and the remaining curds are “cheddared” to achieve the right moisture and pH level before being put through a mill and finally transferred into molds for pressing. Hand-rubbed with local honey and Redmond RealSalt®, SeaHive is a well-balanced cheese. Honey is sourced from a cherry orchard located next to dairy. The RealSalt® is harvested from the ancient (now dry) Sundance Seabed near Redmond, Utah and contains more than 50 natural trace minerals and an extremely high iron content. The salt also contains tiny flecks of color. Although Beehive tried some early experiments where they aged the cheeses in the salt mines, unfortunately, the temperatures were too warm. These days, the cheeses are matured in temperature controlled environment but still undergo a unique process. The rub is applied to the cheeses at one day of age and they are placed in special bags for aging. By three months of age, the high salt content of the cheese salt has drawn the liquid whey out. However, by 8 months the whey has all been reabsorbed.The net result of this is that by the time the cheeses are released at about eight months, the salt and honey rub give the paste of the cheese slightly sweeter and snappier taste than Beehive’s other cheeses.   Also, due to the salt application on the rind, it has a slightly drier texture."

Seastack,Mt. Townsend Creamery,United States,Washington,"3 ins diameter, 2 ins high",6.4 oz, www.mttownsendcreamery.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Founded in 2005 by Matt Day and Ryan Trail, Mt Townsend Creamery is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Port Townsend, WA. Having had a successful tenure at the New Belgium Brewery as a process engineer, Ryan started to become interested in cheesemaking. Together with his friend Matt, Ryan began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After 2 years Will decided to pursue other interests and Matt and Ryan assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing Marketing, Sales and general business issues. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsular’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses all made from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a 275 cow dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Named after the local rock formations that punctuate the Pacific Northwest coastline, with the creation of Seastack, Mt Townsend were looking to try and capture the essence of the Northwest. Described by some as “taking a bite of the sea”, Seastack is is a mold-ripened cheese, its bloomy rind overlaying a delicate layer of charcoal ash. The cheese is produced using a partial lactic coagulation process. After pasteurization, the milk is cultured and allowed to acidify naturally before rennet is added. After coagulation, the curd is cut and carefully transferred to the cheese molds where its allowed to drain naturally. After unmolding, the young cheeses are transferred to a drying room where they’re left overnight. The following day, the cheeses receive a light coating of charcoal ash mixed with salt which helps to wick away moisture from the surface and aids in the development of the rind. They are then moved to a ripening room where they will remain for about eight days, at which point the cheeses are wrapped and aged for a further two weeks before release. The texture of Seastack is soft and dense, becoming more fluid just under the rind as it ages. Flavors are light and tangy, with hints of salt, earth, mushrooms and citrus."

Selun,Thomas Stadelmann,Switzerland,Toggenburg,"8ins diameter, 2 ins high",3.5 lbs,,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced by the Stadelmann family in the Toggenburg region of Switzerland, Selun, which is named after a local mountain, is a relatively new creation inspired by the French cheese St Nectaire. Traditionally, cheesemaking in Switzerland followed strict regulations in terms of the variety of cheeses that could be made. However, over the course of the last three decades, a shift has taken place and now several innovative cheesemakers have created entirely new cheeses, one of which is Selun. During the 1980’s the Stadelmann family, who were producers of Tilsiter, decided to break away from the Tilsiter consortium and create their own organic range of cheeses. The operation is now run by Thomas Stadelmann. Thomas uses cow’s milk sourced from organic, local herds which he thermalizes (heat treats) for cheesemaking. (Thermalized milk is heated to a temperature between that of raw milk and pasteurization.) For production, the curd is inncoluted with a culture called brevibacterium linens and, after coagulation and draining, the curd is cut into strips that are placed into the cheese molds and allowed to drain further. After a few hours, the young wheels are unmolded and placed in a brine (salt water) solution for three hours, before being transferred to a maturing room. There, they are matured for between 6-10 weeks, during which time they are washed twice each week with a brine solution. The brevibacterium linens culture already present in the cheese responds favorably to the salty environment, resulting in the cheeses developing a highly aromatic rind and a soft texture. As a final touch just prior to release, each cheese is decorated with finely shopped hay flowers to form the word “Selun” and the distinctive crown image on its upper rind. The texture is soft and yielding and ivory white. The rind is a pink-beige color and sticky. Although the aroma of Selun is powerful and stinky, flavors are rich, meaty and buttery, with notes of herbs, flowers and hay and a full cream-like finish."
Senne-Flade,Girenbad Dairy,Switzerland,Gewicht,"12 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",3lbs,www.chaesi-girenbad.ch,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced in the Zürich hill-lands of Switzerland, Senne-Flade is an aromatic, washed-rind cow’s milk cheese made by third generation cheesemaker Paul Bieri of Girenbad Dairy. In the mid 1800’s, this area was home to more than 50 different dairies. Today, only 25 of them are still in operation, a number that would be significantly less, were it not for he efforts of the “Natürli”-Consortium”. This consortium, under the guidance of Fredy Bieri, Paul’s brother, has created a marketing and sales platform for the area’s regional dairies. The Girenbad dairy is situated about 40 minutes drive from Zurich and 2500 feet above sea level. Today the dairy is run by Paul’s daughter Christa Egli, although Paul still oversees the cheesemaking. Each day at least 2500 liters (660 US gallons) of raw milk are transformed into a variety of different cheeses, one of them being Senne-Flade. Paul first began experimenting with soft, washed-rind cheeses in 1997. As a result of very good feedback, he decided to produce Senne-Flade on a regular basis. The name translates literally as Senne meaning “herdsman” and fladä meaning “a flat round thing” – which can sometimes refer to a cake made with apples or even a cow patty. For cheesemaking, Paul uses thermalised evening milk, heating it briefly up to a temperature of 60?C (140?F), combined with raw morning milk. As the milk is heated, natural calf rennet is added as a coagulant. After gently transferring the cut curds to the molds, the young cheeses are allowed to drain before being unmolded, salted and moved to an aging room. Cheeses are matured for at least one month and frequently longer. During this time, each wheel is regularly washed with a brine solution. This produces the pungent aroma and pink, slightly sticky rind associated with Senne-Flade. The texture of the cheese is soft and smooth. When young, flavors are slightly tart, but this dissipates with age, when the cheese becomes stronger, more assertive and more rounded with a creamy mouthfeel."
Serpa,Various,Portugal,Alentejo,Varies,4oz -18oz,,Sheep,,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"Named for the town of the Baixo Alentejo, Serpa is produced in the lower Alentejo region of southeast Portugal, near the border with Spain from raw sheep’s milk. Milk for production comes from the native Merino sheep (rather than the Bordaleira breed) and the sheep are milked twice a day. The milk is heated and poured through a cloth filled with sea salt, which means no other salting process is needed during production. The milk is then coagulated with cardoon thistle rennet. After about three quarters of an hour, the curd is broken up into rice sized pieces, drained and scooped into molds. Cheeses are then transferred to maturing rooms where they’re aged for at least 2 months. Towards the end of their maturation, the cheeses are wrapped in a band of cotton cloth. This helps the cheese to keep its shape and holds in moisture to prevent cracking of the rind. Serpa was granted DOP (name protected) status and is further protected by the Slow Food presidium. The exterior rind of Serpa is beige brown in color, with occasional white and gray molds. It is slightly waxy and firm.When young, the cheese has a softer texture, referred to as “Amenteigado” which is often the preferred way of eating it since you can scoop it out with a spoon.  Flavors at this point are complex, buttery and sheepy with a pronounced but well-integrated sour and bitter note – a direct result of the thistle rennet. If allowed to mature, the texture becomes firmer and more robust.  Flavors intensify considerably, becoming strong, spicy and aromatic."
Serra da Estrela,Various,Portugal,Plateau of Serra da Estrela ,"6-7 ins diameter, 1.5-2 ins high",2 lbs,,Sheep,,Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"Serra da Estrela is named after a mountain that lies in the ruggedly beautiful region between the Dão and Mondego rivers of northern Portugal. The cheese has been produced for over 800 years using raw milk sourced from the local Bordeliera or Churra breeds of sheep. For cheesemaking, the milk is strained, heated and a true vegetable rennet added, made from the stamens of the cardoon thistle which grows wild in this region. Thistle rennet creates a particularly citrus-like, earthy and almost sour flavor in the cheese. After coagulation, the whey is drained off and the remaining curds lightly washed and broken up by hand. They are gently transferred to cloth-lined molds, preserving as much moisture as possible, and slowly pressed by hand. This helps to give Serra da Estrela its dense, elastic texture. The young cheeses are rubbed with salt and and left overnight before being transferred to the maturing rooms. There they remain for between 30-45 days for the more buttery-textured Ananteigada version or six months for the mature Velho style. The season when the cheeses are made has a considerable impact of the texture and flavor of the finished wheel, with those produced in the spring having a richer texture and more herbaceous flavors whereas late winter cheeses are more intense and dense. Serra da Estrela pairs well with fruitier style red wines or a dry Vouvray (Chenin Blanc)."

Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successibe generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay. For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats. Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition. Sevenwood (which used to be known as Myrtlewood) is an aged, raw cow`s milk cheese which is washed in balsamic vinegar while it ages.Named for the seven ""allowable"" varieties of wood in which traditional balsamic vinegar is aged, Sevenwood has an earthy, fruity flavor and a firm, smooth texture."
Sgt. Pepper,Cypress Grove Chevre,United States,Northern California,3 ins diameter.  1 inch high,4 oz,www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Soft,Vegetable,FlavoredNone,Fresh,Flavor added to paste,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Cypress Grove produces a variety of fresh, flavored chevres, each of which have their own distinct identity and name, mirroring the ingredients used as well as the company’s play on words. For production, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are then added. The mixture is moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt and formed into disks. Herbs and other flavorings are added by hand. The disks are then vacuum sealed, labeled and sent directly to market without aging. Cypress Grove’s Fresh Chevre is available in several varieties; Ms Natural, Purple Haze, Herbs de Humboldt, Sgt Pepper and PsycheDillic that known collectively as the Flashback Family of Chevre. Sgt. Pepper is small disk is made with the addition of four exotic peppers, spices and chili threads that are blended into the cheese as well as being applied to the exterior.The resulting flavors are pleasantly spicy and complex and visually very appealing."
Shaker Blue,Old Chatham Sheepherding Company,United States,New York,"7-8 ins diameter, 4-5 ins high",3.5 lbs, www.blacksheepcheese.com,Sheep,,Blue,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Located in the upper reaches of the Hudson River Valley, Old Chatham Sheepherding Company was founded in 1993 by Tom and Nancy Clark, with 150 East Friesian ewes. It could be said that it was destined to happen, since at aged 10, Tom won a blue ribbon at the Dutchess County Fair for his Hampshire Sheep. At the time he pronounced to a local newspaper reporter that he wanted to raise a flock when he grew up. After life took his career in a different direction for a number of years, the Clarks did, in fact, end up raising that flock when they built Old Chatham Sheepherding Company. The couple has been involved in every aspect of the company, from the design of the barns to cheesemaking to working to maintain the property. Old Chatham not only produce cheeses, but also sheep’s milk yogurt. In fact, in 2007, the yogurt was in such demand that the milk supply on the property was strained. Consequently, they began a program working with a number of Amish farmers in their area to buy their milk as well as helping to increase the farmers’ sheep milk production. This ensured the Old Chatham was able to continue to maximise production of their cheeses and yogurts. Old Chatham’s own flock now numbers over 800 ewes comprised of East Friesian, Dorset Finn and various crosses and as such, constitutes the largest sheep dairy in the United States. Both Tom and Nancy harbored a long desired to make a blue sheep’s milk cheese in the style of Roquefort. However, they were also aware that in order to prevent cross-contamination of the blue molds with the molds used in their other cheeses, they would require a separate production facility. Initially, they struck up an agreement with a Wisconsin creamery already producing a sheep`s milk blue, to make the cheese and label it under the Hudson Valley name. However, the arrangement didn`t work out and Ewe`s Blue production ceased. Unable to find an alternate facility, Tom and Nancy finally decided to construct a purpose-built cheesemaking room on their own land to continue making Ewe`s Blue. Ewe`s Blue is a pasteurized cheese and is a staple of the Old Chatham repertoire. However, to expand the range further, it was finally decided to produce a raw sheep`s milk version which is called Shaker Blue. According to Tom Clark, Old Chatham`s Shaker Blue is even closer to the Roquefort-style blue he and his wife envisioned.The texture of  Shaker Blue is is semifirm, moist and creamy, and the flavors are full and lingering. You can taste the richness of the sheep`s milk, a pleasing acidity and a sweetness in the finish."

Shenandoah,Everona Dairy,United States,Virginia,"8 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",5 lbs, www.everonadairy.com,Sheep,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"It is rare indeed that a dog began a dairy, but that is exactly what happened in the case of Everona Dairy. At a Food Festival in 1992, the late Dr. Patricia (Pat) Elliot came upon a demonstration of the skills of Border Collies and was so impressed, she took a puppy home with her. Soon it became obvious that the dog needed something to keep occupied, and what is the best thing to keep a Border Collie occupied? Sheep. So, sheep were purchased and in time began to drain the good doctor’s bank account. In an effort to have the sheep pay for themselves, Dr. Elliot began milking them with a view to developing a cheesemaking operation.Whereas some people might be daunted by the prospect of taking on an additional new cheesemaking career with no previous knowledge of sheep or making cheese, Dr. Elliot was undeterred. A medical doctor who had raised seven children and adopted two others, while simultaneously putting herself through medical school, she was well equipped with the determination to teach herself how to make cheese. Pat was also a life-long DIYer and, after reading books on the topic, at age 67 took classes at the University of Wisconsin to learn the scientific side of cheese making. By 1996, she had also travelled to Greece for further education. While it took a long time to reach the skill-level necessary to produce great cheese, in 2005 the ACS awarded Everona‘s Piedmont with its top honors in the Farmhouse Sheep’s milk cheese category. Until her death in 2013 at age 85, Dr. Elliot continued to practice medicine as well as helping to run the Dairy with her son, Brian, and daughter-in-law, Carolyn.Created in 2008 by Pat and Carolyn, Shenandoah is an alpine style cheese made with raw sheep’s milk. During production, the newly formed cheese is lightly pressed and then washed in a brine solution before being aged for 3 to 6 months, during which time it is washed again in the brine solution. This helps it to develop its semi-firm, smooth texture. The flavor is sweet with notes of grass, hay, butter and nuts; it is like Emmentaler (Swiss Cheese), but without the holes.This is a cheese to enjoy with beer. Whether it is a light Hefeweizen, or a complex Belgian Ale, the floral and nutty flavors of the cheese complement beer very well. Shenandoah can be used in any dish that calls for Swiss cheese or an Alpine cheese such as Ementaller. It melts beautifully and adds that sweet, nutty character to everything from a ham sandwich to fondue."

Partnering with Josh Halder from Verde Farms and former Fruition Restaurant sous chef Jimmy Warren, Siedel’s idea was to create a learning center and a sustainable relationship between farm and restaurant, spreading awareness among community members and local restaurants of the fundamentals of farming produce, animal husbandry and the creation of artisanal products. After attending the Dairy Sheep Association of North America’s annual symposium in the Hudson Valley, the trio was inspired to create Colorado’s first artisanal sheep dairy and creamery. Less than a year later, in September of 2010, they welcomed a flock of 40 milking ewes and one ram. Cheesemaking began three days later. Today Fruition Farms sells lamb and sheep’s wool in addition to three farmstead cheeses, which are produced using whole sheep’s milk from twice-daily milkings. Inspired by the many different soft-ripened cheeses of the world, Shepherd’s Halo was gradually developed using the milk that was set aside each morning for the “shepherd’s share,” to enrich daily coffees and bowls of cereal. Whole sheep’s milk is gently pasteurized at a low temperature, then transformed by the addition of rennet and mesophilic cultures, as well as the addition of Penicillium and Geotrichum candidum molds, which create the cheese’s bloomy white rind. A four-hour salt brine is followed by a 21-day aging period.The “halo” in this cheese’s name is inspired by the buttery-textured halo of creamline that encircles a chalkier center and grows as the cheese ages. Flavor is salty and sweet with a mild acidity.Fruition Farms’ cheesemakers suggest pairing Shepherd’s Halo with fruits, preserves or chutney. For wine pairings, try a Sauvignon Blanc or a Riesling."

Small-scale production, along with pasture-fed animals and the use of raw milk, ensures that these cheeses reflect the local terroir and the change of the seasons.Shepherd’s Peak is a raw sheep’s milk cheese inspired by the old-world sheep’s milk cheeses of the Pyrenees. It ages to 90 days, and it is made in very limited quantities.Flavors are reminiscent of toasted nuts, freshly baked bread, and creamy, fresh, sweet milk. Pair Shepherd’s Peak with a bigger red such as a Tuscan Bordeaux, or a wheat beer. "

Shropshire Blue,Colston Bassett Dairy,United Kingdom,Nottinghamshire,"8-9 ins diameter, 14 ins high",17 lbs, www.colstonbassettdairy.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Natural,,,"Funded by a group of local milk producers and local cheese lovers, Colston Bassett and District Dairy was built in 1913 specifically to make Stilton in the Vale of Belvoir, Nottinghamshire, England.Colston Bassett are also one of the smallest Shopshire Blue dairies in the country. They buy milk from five farms surrounding the dairy and have been buying from the same farms since the 1920s.Since that time, there have only been four head cheesemakers at Colston Bassett: Tom Coy, Ernie Wagstaff, Richard Rowlett and now Billy Kevan. Their Shropshire Blue is more traditional than any other. The curd is hand-ladled before draining, which treats the curd more gently and preserves its structure, resulting in a luscious, creamy texture when the cheeses are mature.By British standards, Shropshire Blue is a comparatively recent invention, , created in the 1930`s by a Cheshire Cheese factor (dealer) called Dennis Biggins.The only major difference between Stilton and Shropshire Blue is the addition of natural annato coloring (annato is derived from a South American shrub) that gives the cheese a very mildly spicy flavor and a slightly softer texture than Stilton.Shropshire Blue has all the qualities of a good, creamy Stilton. Flavors are rich and slightly spicy, with a lingering finish and a savory sweetness."

Both formerly from Manhattan, Karen and Paul bought the farm in 1990, and now run a flock of 120 East Friesian milking sheep on the property. The sheep are rotationally grazed and moved to fresh pasture every 24 hours. Karen and Paul have worked hard to develop and manage the grazing, providing a wide variety of forage such as clovers, fescue, trefoil, wild oregano, timothy and cattails to enhance the animals` diet and improve milk quality. In addition to cheesemaking, Karen and Paul also sell their lambs, wool and soaps at a number of Farmers Markets that they regularly attend. During the season which runs from April to September, the sheep are milked twice each day. Every morning, Karen combines cooled milk from the previous evening`s milking with the warm, fresh milk from the morning`s milking to make cheese. Karen makes a variety of cheeses, as well as a sheep`s milk yogurt. The cheeses include the camembert-style Shushan Snow, Feta, and two versions of an aged, Basque-style sheep`s milk cheese called Battenkill Brebis, one of which is smoked and called Frere Fumant. Based on a camembert recipe, Shushan Snow is a mold ripened cheese weighing about 6oz. The texture is soft, becoming extremely creamy and yielding as it ages. Flavors are rich, sweet and tangy with the hint of mushrooms."

Silver Mountain,Bravo Farms,United States,California,"10 ins diameter, 14 ins high",12-14 lbs, www.bravofarms.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Cloth Wrapped,,,"Pat and Bill Boersma started Bravo Farms dairy in 1979. Located near Visalia in the San Jaoquin Valley in California, Bill and Pat ran the farm solely as a dairy operation for several years before making the decision to get into cheese production and to concentrate their efforts on making cheddar.In 2006, the Boersmas made the decision to sell their herd of 80 cows to a neighbor, which has allowed them to focus their attention solely on cheese production. They continue to work closely with, and buy the milk back from the herd`s new owner, thereby ensuring the necessary quality and consistency for cheesemaking.In addition to this development, Bill and Pat have recently formed a partnership with Jonathan Van Ryn, a young artisan cheesemaker who studied cheesemaking at California Polytechnic University. Jonathan`s arrival has allowed Bravo to expand production considerably without compromising quality.Now, in addition to the traditional cheddars, Bravo has gone into the production of Silver Mountain, a cloth bound cheddar that is matured for nine months.Silver Mountain is a cylindrical cheese weighing 12-15lbs., and the idea came when Bill found some discarded hoops previously used for shaping Stilton.The recipe for Silver Mountain a combintation of an English Cheddar and Cantal from France.The young cheeses are wrapped in cheesecloth in the style of traditional cheddar. This protects the cheeses and allows them to breathe during maturation, which results in some moisture loss and a concentration of flavor. Using a Cantal technique, the wheels are removed from their molds after two days, unwrapped from the cloth, and dipped again in warm whey. This method re-activates the cultures. Afterwards, the cheeses are repacked in their cheesecloth-lined molds and pressed a second time to expel more moisture. As part of the maturing process, the wheels are first coated with lard, followed later with olive oil. This helps prevent mold from becoming too excessive.Having initially sold Silver Mountain at six months of age, Boersma is now releasing them at nine months.Silver Mountain is an aromatic cheese. Flavors are balanced, deep and rich, with hints of brown butter and caramel. The texture is close and firm, similar in some respects to a cheddar, but not as creamy or waxy.Pairs well with a big red wine."

Requirements for this are that the milk come from the heritage breed of Gloucester cows and that the cheese is produced to the traditional, Single Gloucester recipe within a designated area. Diana Smart`s Single Gloucester meets all these criteria.Traditionally, Single Gloucester would be made on the same farm as Double Gloucester. Single Gloucester was the ""house"" cheese, whereas Double Gloucester was usually sold at market.On certain days the milk was skimmed for cream to make butter. When that happened, the skimmed milk would be used to make Single Gloucester. On days when the milk was left whole they would make Double Gloucester.Smaller, crumblier and milder than the better known Double Gloucester, Single is more economical to make and is produced from the lower fat milk from the evening milking, together with a small amount of whole milk from the following morning`s milking.Flavors of Diana Smart`s Single Gloucester are gentle, milky and slightly sweet and vanilla-like, with a cool, clean tang and grassy sub-flavors.The texture is deliciously light, smooth and slightly crumbly ."
Sirene (Bulgarian Feta),,Bulgaria,Various,,,,SheepCowGoat,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,Microbial,None,,,"Feta might be one of Greece`s culinary claims to fame, but that Mediterranean nation is the only one in Europe with a longstanding tradition of brined cheese-making. And while true Greek Feta is now a certified Grecian cheese under a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), many countries throughout the Baltic make similar feta style cheeses, often referred to as some translation of ""white cheese"" or, in Bulgaria, Sirene. It makes sense that this type of cheese evolved throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. In these sweltering climes, overly rapid acceleration of mold growth, spoilage, and surface cracking are highly problematic to the production of edible cheese. Brining has long represented a solution to the problem, inhibiting bacterial growth by storing the cheese in an acidified saltwater solution. White brined cheeses, which grow salty from months in their bath, are found from Egypt to Greece to Turkey and beyond. Since Bulgarian sirene doesn`t fall under the PDO for Feta, it`s not subject to the same strict production rules, and it can vary considerably from producer to producer. While it was historically produced mostly using sheep`s milk, today it`s often made from a mix of cow`s, sheep`s, and goat`s milks. In the United States, where PDO name regulations do not apply, it`s often sold under the name ""Bulgarian Feta."" The version in this photo is imported to the United States by Castella, and is produced entirely with sheep`s milk.Sirene has a pronounced tart, salty flavor. It is firm, crumbly and chalk-white.Sirene is mostly used in cooking: crumbled into a shopskasalad with tomatoes and cucumbers, rolled into a banitsa pastry, or stuffed into a red pepper that`s then fried. But itcan also make a great table cheese; sprinkle it with paprika and olive oil, or serve it alongside rosé."
Smoked Baby Swiss,Boggy Meadow Farm,United States,New Hampshire,12 in length x 5 in width,5 lbs,www.boggymeadowfarm.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Vegetable,Smoked,Alpine-style,Smoked,"Smoked Baby Swiss is the maple-smoked version of the Swiss cheese produced at Boggy Meadow Farm, located in a stunningly beautiful area on the banks of the Connecticut River in New Hampshire. There has been a farm on the site for centuries, and a dairy farm for as long as anyone can remember, but it is only in the last few years that cheese has been made there. Records show that Jonathan Mason, a retired United States Senator from Massachusetts, purchased Boggy Meadow Farm in 1822, and the 400 acre farm has been owned and operated by his descendants ever since. Milk for production comes from the farm`s own herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows. Smoked Baby Swiss is made once a week in the creamery, which is located in the converted 18th century barn and farmhouse across from the dairy parlor. “The interesting aspect of ‘Swiss’ cheese,” says owner Marcus Lovell-Smith, “ is that no salt is added to the curd—the only additives are the bacteria and the rennet, which makes the cheese a ‘pure’ derivation of the original raw milk.” The cheese is made using a washed-curd technique; halfway through the process the curds are washed with fresh water to reduce the acidity. Lovell-Smith says that this step, along with the use of whole milk instead of skim milk in production, contributes to the cheese’s richness and creaminess. After aging the cheese until its “eyes” form (the characteristic holes created by the propionic acid bacteria), wheels are smoked using maple wood.Smoked Baby Swiss has a fudgy, mouth-coating texture and a caramel complexion. Taste is meaty and salty, with strong smoky aromas that remind us of bacon.Pair Smoked Baby Swiss with a Bock beer, a Gewurztraminer, or with Boggy Meadow Farm’s own Switchel Cider Vodka."

Today Grafton Cheese handcrafts artisanal, aged cheddar and specialty cheeses. Proceeds from the sale of these cheeses support the Windham Foundation’s charitable efforts. This aged and smoked cheddar contains speckles of three types of chili peppers, which are incorporated into the curd before molding. Grafton’s cheese artisan Dane Huebner had been experimenting with many different chili combinations before finally deciding on a mix of habañeros, jalapeños and pasillas. He wanted to differentiate this cheddar from the many other mild pepper versions on the market by using more heat and smoke, creating a flavorful product geared towards fans of truly spicy cheese. Blocks are aged for at least 90 days before being smoked using maple wood chips.The final product is marbled white and orange in color, with a firm, slightly flaky texture and noticeable chunks of pepper. Scent is smoky and meaty, reminiscent of a barbeque or of smoked sausage. Initially robust in flavor, the spice accelerates gradually into a heat that’s stronger than in most other pepper cheeses, but which is still nicely balanced by the young cheddar flavor.Pair it with a pilsner, a Belgian style ale, a hard cider, a sauvignon blanc or a sparkling rosé."

Living in Waco, Texas in the traditional agricultural and crafts community Homestead Heritage, Rebeccah was looking for a way to use some extra spring milk that the community’s Brown Swiss cows had been producing. Using books and experimentation, she gradually began producing dairy products, hard and soft cheeses, eventually teaching her craft to others. In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheeses are raw milk cheeses. This raw cow’s milk Gouda spends two days in Brazos Valley’s restored 1860s smokehouse, where pecan shells are slowly burned to mildly flavor the cheese. The wheels are then aged for two to six months.Smoky aromas waft from this satiny, springy and moist cheese, with hints of black pepper, spicy peppers and bacon. Taste is salty and bitter with sweet background notes that hint at bubblegum and a touch of woodsy smoke.Pair it with a Chianti."

Their mixed-breed herd—including Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss cows—spends most of its time grazing outside on fresh pasture, or munching on high-quality alfalfa hay. In the interest of making this bleu as decadent as possible, Kenny and Jared add cream to the milk before transforming it into curd, and then press the curds very lightly together when formed so as to allow plenty of space for those blue-green molds to grow. To smoke the cheese, Kenny’s has teamed up with Lewis Shuckman of Shuckman’s Smoked Fish in Louisville, K.Y., known for making delicious smoked salmon, whitefish and caviar. Shuckman smokes wheels for 20 minutes over Applewood before they’re waxed for further aging.The layer of brown wax covering Smoked Kentucky Bleu shields any evidence of the intensity that’s to follow, but cutting open the wheel reveals a pale yellow paste with striking blue veining. Aromas are a mix of ham-and-cheese cracker and deep sassafrass rootbeer, while flavor is extremely bold—both in smokiness and in that characteristic blue cheese pungency. The paste is smooth yet extremely dense, with a mouth-coating creaminess to ensure that those intense flavors will linger for a long time.For wine pairings, try this with a riesling or something big, bold and red. For beer, go dark; try a porter or a stout. On a cheeseplate, drizzle the cheese with honey and serve alongside toasted or smoked almonds. It’s also a great match with peaty and high rye whiskeys."

The property had been a dairy farm over four decades ago, but all that remained was a broken down barn and an open-air hay structure. Continuing the legacy of the land, the Golds decided to create an artisan cheesemaking facility there. After completely renovating the barn and hay structure, as well as building a brand new barn to house their cheesemaking facility, they moved in with their Brown Swiss cows. Today the Golds produce a range of dairy products as well as soaps and lotions. Focusing on quality rather than quantity, they adhere to a range of sustainable farming practices, such as recycling whey to feed their pigs, supplementing feed grain with spelt wheat from a local distillery, and keeping fertilizer and antibiotic use to a bare minimum. So that the cows are able to roam freely, they never house more than 35 at a time. Head cheesemaker and gourmet chef Fernando Chavez-Sandoval, known for his creativity and experimentation with new recipes, is responsible for the production of Gold Creek Farm’s line of award-winning cheeses. This parmesan is aged for two years and then smoked in Chavez-Sandoval’s secret blend of wood chips.Hard and crumbly beneath its orange-brown exterior, Gold Creek’s Smoked Parmesan is pungent and earthy, with a hint of smoke that is well balanced both in the nose and on the palate.Pair it with any woodsy cabernet or merlot, and serve alongside cured meats."

The Knight’s 50 Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Head cheesemaker and creamery co-owner Jennifer Betancourt first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University, where she majored in Animal Science and helped to produce the school’s NY State Cheddar. After meeting her husband David and moving back to Maine, she worked for a few years in nonagricultural jobs before gradually turning her Portland apartment kitchen into a cheesemaking facility, sourcing her milk from Smiling Hill Farm. Eventually, in 2003, Jennifer and the Knight family decided to form a more official partnership and to move cheese production to the farm, and Silvery Moon Creamery was born. Today Jennifer and David live in the apartment above the barn, and Jennifer works seven days a week to produce, age and sell the cheese. Silvery Moon Creamery’s Provolone is a pasta filata cheese, which is cultured and hand-sculpted in the traditional manner (fresh chunks of curd are dunked in hot water or whey causing them to become malleable and making them easier to form into desired shapes). The ball-shaped cheeses are hung to age for one month. Thisversion is cold-smoked using applewood from Jennifer’s Grandfather’s orchard.With a scent strongly reminiscent of applewood smoke, this Smoked Provolone has a thick dark rind that almost resembles wood. Paste is firm and crumbly, almost a bit grainy, with buttery notes. Away from the rind, smoky flavor becomes less pronounced, and a nice balance between salty and smoky is achieved. Woodsy tones linger in the finish.Pair this Smoked Provolone with a wheat beer, or meltit on top of a burger."

Rogue was originally founded in 1935 by Ig`s father, Tom, who ran it as a successful creamery for many years. Upon Tom`s death in 1998 (aged 100), Ig took over and then finally sold it to David and Cary in 2002, with the stipulation that they would continue to make the creamery’s signature cheeses according to tradition. Today, Rogue Creamery is a thriving business that produces a variety of award winning cheeses in addition to the originals that the Vella family created. Milk for production comes from Delmar at Rogueview Dairy. Delmar has 70 acres with 1/4 mile frontage on the river - a beautiful piece of property in a valley that used to be loaded with small dairies of 15-20 cows. Delmar started with 90 cows and has grown to 200, where he has held for the past 15 years. The milkers go out on pasture daily, when weather permits, (from March-October), but are not exclusively grass-fed, as they also get hay and grain. For production of Smokey Blue, Rogue selects some of their wheels of Oregon Blue and cold smokes them for 16 hours over northwest-grown hazelnut shells. At the time of release, wheels are about six months of age.The texture of Smokey Blue is smooth and dense, punctuated with deep, blue-colored pockets of mold. The exterior rind is a golden-brown color.Flavors are a wonderfully complex balance, with sweet notes of wood, earth and grass, balanced by spice and smoke."

The farm is named after the Old Boston Post Stagecoach Road, which runs right through the property. Robert and Gisele Gervais have been farming since 1962, along with their family of fifteenchildren. In 2007 they bought the dairy with their four daughters Anne, Theresa, Susan, and Annette. They’ve since added a cheesemaking facility and a small retail store to sell the cheeses, goat milk soaps, maple syrups, and bakery items that are all made on the farm. Cheesemaker Anne Doe describes Smoking Goud as an accidental cheese. When the family first began making Très Bonne, they had trouble controlling the humidity of the aging caves, as they weren’t filled with enough cheese. As a result, some of the cheeses cracked from the dry air. The four daughters decided to try smoking the cracked wheels and then vacuum-packing them to hold in moisture. After the cheese was a success at the local farmer’s market, they decided to submit it to the American Cheese Society championship in 2013—mostly just to get some constructive criticism from the judges. When the cheese won a silver medal, they decided to add it to the dairy`s permanent roster. Smoking Goud is produced in a “washed curd” Gouda style, then wheels are sent to sister Annette and her husband at Farmer Brown Farm in Bakersfield, VT to be smoked using dried corn cobs. The technique of cob smoking dates back at least hundreds of years in this region, where European settlers learned it from native Abenaki.Aroma is quite smoky, but flavor comes through as meat, with notes of bacon and ham. Hints of banana can be detected near the rind.Pair it with a fruity Zinfandel, strawberries and/or wheat crackers."

First introduced in 2002, firm Snøfrisk is made at the Tine facility in Ostra, Northwestern Norway, from pasteurized goat’s milk with the addition of salt and animal rennet. Cheeses weigh approximately 7lbs and are aged for three months prior to release.The texture of firm Snøfrisk is characterized by a smooth, dense yet pliable texture punctuated with small round holes.  The rind of the cheese consists of an outer coating that allows the cheese to breathe whilst protecting the interior. In terms of flavor, cheeses are mild and rich with notes of cream and earth and a slightly tangy finish.Since Snøfrisk is a particularly mild goat’s milk cheese, it is well suited to both cooking or eating.  In addition to working well on a cheese board, it makes a good topping for tacos, in a quesadilla or Panini, and diced in salads.  Its also makes an excellent substitute for raclette, in a fondue or as a cheese sauce. "

At various times having been home to a subsistence farm, a dairy farm and a thriving egg business, the property was purchased by Jennifer Hines and Pete Schropp in 1986. Hines, who loves cooking and had been experimenting with cheesemaking in her kitchen, and Schropp, who loves animals and had been raising dairy heifers for nearby farms, turned to cheesemaking in order to create a value-added product that would keep the historic farm financially viable. They opened Rockhill Creamery in 2005. In 2007, they finished construction of an underground cheese aging facility. Today they produce cheese twice a week using only the milk from their six Brown Swiss Cows.Cheese at Rockhill farm is produced in 125-gallon batches.After ripening and coagulation of the raw milk, the curd mass is cut into cubes, then stirred. A third of the whey is drained off and replaced with fresh hot water to ""cook"" the curd, which is thenplaced in cheesecloth-lined hoops. Hoops are left on the drain table, where they’re turned and flipped five times that afternoon before the wheels are moved to a brine solution and then into the aging cave. Cheeses are aged for at least two months before going to market.Dark and Snow Canyon Edams are named after two favorite southern Utah canyons, and refer to the same cheese at different stages of aging. Dark Canyon Edam is aged for 2-4 months, developing a creamy and mild flavor. Snow Canyon Edam is usually aged for 12-17 months, becoming much harder and drier, with a white rind. Texture is crumbly and slightly granular.Snow Canyon Edam exhibits a pronounced lack of saltiness and a sharp tang on the back of the tongue. Notes of butter, milk, hay and grass are present.Pair Snow Canyon Edam with a Rioja or with a chardonnay."

Originally from New Zealand, both Jean and Linnea were raised on farms. They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into a property in Maine that has belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Snow Pond, a goat’s milk bloomy rind cheese, is based on a recipe by cheesemaker and author Margaret Morris Peters. Named for one of the local nicknames given to Messalonskee Lake, which is next to the Koons’ property, the small rounds are aged for three to four weeks.Snow Pond is covered in a thick, white rind strongly reminiscent of grass and mushrooms. The paste is varied in texture: it’s chalky towards the outside, and creamier towards the center. Flavor is delightfully mild, milky and creamy with a lingering hint of salt.Pair Snow Pond with a Verdejo or another crisp white wine. For beer pairings, try it with a summer ale such as Rising Tide’s Island Trail."

Snowfields,Saxon Creamery,United States,Wisconsin,,12 lb,http://www.saxoncreamery.com/,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,Plasticoat,Gouda-like,,"Since 2007, Wisconsin’s Saxon Creamery has handcrafted award-winning cow’s milk cheeses. To make their Wisconsin originals, the creamery incorporates European cheesemaking practices with the Lake Michigan terroir of cow’s milk that they source from a sixth-generation family farm.   Snowfields, an aged butterkäse (German for “butter cheese”), highlights the influence of terroir. To make Snowfields, they use only milk made between October and April. This winter milk represents the seasonal change in the herd’s diet. When the temperature dips and the fields turn cold and snowy—an image that inspires both Snowfields’ name and label—the cows can no longer graze on the pastures. Instead, they eat summer grass that has turned sweet with fermentation. The resulting milk is extra rich in cream and protein.   According to Lisa Hall of Saxon Creamery, Snowfields was a happy accident—one that they’ve continued to craft because of its rich flavor. “It was supposed to be one of our traditional cheeses, but the vat went awry,” she says. “After aging the cheese, this cheese was so creamy, so delicate, so velvety.”  After the milk for has been coagulated, the curds are pressed into molds and bathed in a salt brine. The wheels are aged after brining, which lets their flavors to develop. They’re then hand painted with paracoating, a covering that protects the cheese while still letting it ripen and allowing moisture to escape.  The wheels are finished in open air aging rooms, where they’re cleaned and flipped. In total, Snowfields is aged for a minimum of six months, though according to Hall, Snowfields is “divine at 15 months or more.” The aging process allows amino acids to crystallize within the wheel’s firm paste, adding a crunchy texture to some bites.Snowfields is bold and buttery with a hint of sweetness. The rich cream coats the palate with a sweet milk flavor and finishes with savory notes of parmesan.On a cheese board, try Snowfields with nuts, dried apricots, chocolate, or tart apples. It melts well into grilled sandwiches or cream-based sauces. Sip a sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon, aged lager, or hard cider."

It was run for nearly two decades by founder and retired teacher Jim Schott, until he ceased his daily creamery work in 2008. Around that time, the dairy began a partnership with the Skyline Correctional Facility in Cañon City, purchasing milk from the facility’s goat farm—a consistent, quality milk source that offers training opportunities for inmates. (For more info, check out culture’s 2012 photo essay on the partnership.) The cow’s milk cheeses are made with organic milk sourced from a local dairy.  Snowmass was inspired by raclette, the great melting cheese of the Alps. These cow’s milk wheels are aged two to three months, and washed with brine frequently early on to develop an orange colored rind. Like its inspiration, Snowmass is perfect when melted—over potatoes with a side of pickles and ground black pepper, over pasta, or over veggies like broccoli and cauliflower.Snowmass smells savory—think onions cooked in beef fat—with a whiff of rye bread and that signature washed-rind tang. Flavor begins with a pickle-y tartness that relaxes into a buttery finish with a hint of caraway.Pair it with a sauvignon blanc or a Beaujolais. For beer pairings, try a good-quality pilsner."

They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great, great grandfather in the 1870s. Over the years, the suburbs have followed them and they are now the last working dairy in the county.Judy wanted to build a working model that others could follow, but since there were no guidelines for commercial goat dairying, they based their model, through trial and error, on an older, more traditional dairy, centered on herd health, longevity, productivity and on animals who are born, live, and die on the same farm.

When the cheese plant Montchevrein WI decided to start using sheep`s milk, they decided to do it only if they could work with a single source that handled all of the licensing, inspections, inventory and payment. So local sheep farmers responded by forming the WSDC to organize sheep dairying into a more reliable, standardized profession. When the co-op ended up with a surplus of milk, members decided to start making their own cheese.Milk is sourced from mostly East Friesian and Laucane Breed ewes of member farmers. During spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and are fed a limited amount of natural grain while being milked.Somerset is a Double Gloucester English style cheddar made with sheep’s milk and aged for 12 months. Rapped in shiny red wax, the cheese has a soft texture and a mild, earthy flavor. Floral, nutty and grassy flavors intersect with a hint of toast and butter.Pair it with a Pinot Noir or a Champagne.

There, they make three excellent cheeses: Spenwood, Wigmore and WaterlooAs a graduate from the school of Dairy Science at Reading University, Anne, together with her husband Andy, began making cheese during the 1980`s. They were spurred on in this effort by Patrick Rance, who owned a cheese shop nearby and whose passionate desire to prevent small-scale British cheesemakers from disappearing altogether resulted in a renaissance of British cheese production.The Wigmores` Village Maid Cheese Company has, over the years, played an important role in the re-introduction of sheep`s milk cheese to Britain. Sheep`s milk cheeses had almost disappeared by the 18th century and it is only in rlatively recent times - since the 1980`s that they have startd to make a comeback. However, in the early days of their business when they required only small quantities of milk, ironically it was far easier to buy in small amounts of sheep`s milk than cow`s milk. That, in addition to becoming inspired by the sheep`s milk cheeses of Sardinia after a holiday there, proved to be the main deciding factors for their sheep cheese production.Milk for the production of Spenwood comes from three herds (one organic) of nearby Dorset Friesland sheep. Cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk, and matured on site at the Wigmore`s facility.Named after the Berkshire village of Spencers Wood, Spenwood is a hard, pressed sheep`s milk cheese, similar in style of production to some Italian Pecorinos.Delicious at six months, Spenwood holds up well to 12 months which is when Anne prefers it, when the cheese is drier and the flavors are more concentrated.Spenwood has a thin, grey and evenly distributed rind. The texture is smooth and dense, with an ivory-colored paste.Flavors hint at caramel. Sweet, rich, nutty and deep, it is ideal for cooking - especially grated over pasta."

The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw and thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible.

By the end of the century a decision was made to bring the family`s knowledge and appreciation of European cheeses to America. By the early 1900`s, Otto Roth, son of the founder, had established a successful business that soon became one of the largest importers of European specialty cheeses in North America, laying the foundation for what today forms Roth Käse USA.  In 1991, convinced there was a future for making great cheeses in America, Fermo Jaeckle, a former executive with Otto Roth & Co., joined with his cousins, Felix and Ulrich Roth, to further extend their European/Swiss roots and cheesemaking expertise into the rolling hills of Green County, Wisconsin.  Known locally as Little Switzerland for its source of high quality milk, this area of Wisconsin is particularly well-suited for cheesemaking. It is here that Roth Käse USA was established, initially with a view towards making authentic Alpine-style cheeses.  In 2009, Roth Käse USA merged with Emmi Swiss dairy cooperative to form Emmi Roth. Today, Emmi Roth’s expansive portfolio displays a unique marriage of cheeses from two different worlds with very similar traditions and local values: Roth cheeses from Wisconsin and Emmi’s full range of traditional varieties imported from Switzerland.   To make this cheese, Roth cheesemakers add a sriracha chili spice blend directly to milk in the vat before transforming it into a gouda-style wheel. Before an aging period of at least one month, the wheels are rubbed with crushed red pepper, creating a striking, bright red rind. Mild and buttery upfront with hints of yogurt and sweet chile sauce, this red-flecked gouda incites a slight heat that builds in the throat and lingers pleasantly. Sriracha Gouda’s sweet-meets-spicy flavors play well with apple cider, pale ales, or IPAs. "
St. Albans,Vermont Creamery,United States,Vermont,,2.82 oz.,www.vermontcreamery.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Microbial,,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"The first 100% cow’s milk cheese and the first non-GMO Certified cheese made at Vermont Creamery, St. Albans represents a recent dive into new territory for this well-loved VT dairy.  But founders Bob Reese and Allison Hooper are no strangers to pushing the envelope. Their Websterville-based creamery, founded in 1984, was among the first dairies to introduce French-style goat’s milk cheeses to the U.S. market. Hooper had spent time with a small-scale cheesemaker in Brittany during the 1970s, and was working as a state dairy lab technician when she responded to a request from Bob Reese—at that time, a marketing director for the VT Dept. of Agriculture—to produce some fresh chèvre for a state dinner. After that cheese was a hit, Bob and Allison decided to go into cheese production on a more formal basis, founding Vermont Creamery. The pair have always focused primarily on goat’s milk cheeses, buying from local farmers and, more recently, setting up the first demonstration goat dairy in the state. But they’ve also worked with the St. Albans Cooperative to source cow’s milk over the years. That milk, produced by a group of over 400 dairy farmers, was used only to make cultured butter, crème fraîche, or the occasional mixed-milk cheese—until now. The creamery worked alongside the St. Albans Co-op to select a single family farm that could transition to using GMO-free feed. They settled on the Paul-Lin Farm, run by a multi-generational family milking a herd of 30 Jersey cows, and the year-long transition began.  Named after the hometown of the Co-op, St. Albans is modeled after a French cheese named after a different saint: Marcellin. Like its French counterpart, the VT Creamery version is soft and bloomy-rinded, sold in a little ceramic crock. The curd formed to make it—which coagulates slowly over a period of 24 hours—is so delicate and moist, it can only drain in cheesecloths overnight before being gently shaped into forms. Over 11 days in the aging room, the small discs develop a wrinkly rind.This cheese is a delight to the senses on many levels. That wrinkly, brainy rind contrasts beautifully with its dark ceramic crock, while aromas of rising dough, warm asphalt and sour milk are subtle and inviting. Paste is luscious and spreadable, like fresh buttercream frosting, coating the mouth as it mellows from an initial citrus bite into a creamy finish, with notes of salted butter, artichokes, and savory undertones to round it all out.Pair St. Albans with a Syrah from the the Rhône, a Sauvignon Blanc or a farmhouse ale from VT (we recommend Arthur from Hill Farmstead Brewery, if you can find it). Serve alongside some crisp fruit or fig jam, or warm it slightly in a toaster oven before dipping bread into it, like a mini fondue."

Thus hooked on cheese, Rigg began developing products and designing her own creamery in Schertz, Texas, which released its first cheese in October 2014. Milk for River Whey’s line of fresh and raw milk aged cheeses is sourced from Mill-King Market & Creamery in nearby McGregor, Texas. St. Clements is one of River Whey’s two fresh, seasonal cheeses; it’s made only in winter, when local oranges are available. Rigg makes the creamy combo by an acid-induced coagulation of the milk using orange juice and lemon juice. Citrus-sweet flavors are boosted by the addition of orange zest and Texas honey (sourced from Holdman Honey in Seguin) into the final mix.Smelling like an orange creamsicle, St. Clements is simply addictive. It straddles a perfect line between tangy and sweet, and has an amazingly fluffy texture. It’s just tinged with fresh, zippy citrus flavors that never overwhelm the creaminess.Stuff St. Clements into a cannoli or dust it with mini chocolate chips and eat it with a spoon."

Gott and his partner Nicola Robinson have an established a flock of Lacaune ewes, a breed that originated in the Auvergne region of France.   To make this square-shaped cheese, Gott and Robinson use sheep`s milk from an early-morning milking, which is pumped directly through from the milking parlor into the cheesemaking vat while it`s still warm. They increase temperature slightly and add a starter culture that`s been cultivated on-site. The milk sits for about half anhour to ripen before the rennet is added. Within about ninety minutes, the milk has coagulated, and it’s cut into half-inch squares, left for twenty minutes to allow some of the whey to drain off, and then scooped into molds lined with cloth.   The newly formed cheeses are left overnight to drain and towards the end of the day, weights are placed on top to complete the draining process. After removing the cloth, the cheeses are turned out onto racks for a dat hours in the warm, humid salting room before dry salt is applied to their rinds on day three or four. On day five, the wheels are transferred to maturing rooms where they are washed regularly to encourage the development of the Brevibacterium linens culture that gives the cheese its distinct rind and flavor.St James is semi-soft with a pale, cream-colored interior paste, a slightly tacky texture, and a gentle brown-orange rind. It`s complex—deeply flavorful and buttery, with notes of custard and a sweet, almondy finish.

Any younger than this, and the smell and taste do not develop sufficiently.St. Nectaire has a washed rind that becomes grayish-purple with age, dotted with white, yellow and red molds. The paste is supple with a silky texture that is heavy on the tongue and resistant to the bite. It melts in the mouth to reveal a slight acidity and also tastes of cellars, mushrooms, nuts and hay.Cheeses with an oval label indicate fermier production cheese. Those with a square label are industrial. Produced mainly in the southwest of Puy de Dôme, the manufacture of St. Nectaire is protected by AOC laws.The aroma and flavor of St. Nectaire are extremely closely intertwined. It has earthy, pastoral aromas and the flavor is creamy, rich and redolent of freshly cut grass, sweet hay, meadow flowers and wild herbs."

Discovering that her new company was fulfiling a tremendous need and niche, Sue asked Peggy to join her in launching a greatly expanded business, including a permanent farm-market type store selling locally made food products and a cheesemaking operation. The cheesemaking business and retail stores became known as Cowgirl Creamery.The business flourished, and it quickly became clear that the cheese retail, wholesale and cheese making operations were the most successful. Today, Cowgirl Creamery has additional retail stores in San Francisco and Washington DC together with a much larger cheesemaking operation and warehouse based in Petaluma, CA.Cowgirl Creamery, under the guidance of head cheesemaker Maureen Cunnie, produces a range of fresh and mold ripened cheeses using organic cow`s milk from small local dairies.Production of St. Pat takes place seasonally, during the Spring and early summer months. It is named St. Pat because, traditionally in West Marin, the cows are let out of their winter barn accomodation on St. Patrick`s Day - March 17th, which is when the cheese becomes available.Nettles are harvested locally in Bolinas, at Fresh Run Farm, blanched briefly for sterilization and to de-sting them, and then applied to the young cheeses.Over the course of the next two weeks, St. Pat develops a light coat of white candidum mold over the top of the nettle leaves.Flavors of the St. Pat are rich (due to the fresh, spring whole milk) and vegetal. Aromas are rich and buttery with herbaceous overtones. Very accessible, mild and yet full flavored."
St. Stephen,Four Fat Fowl,United States,New York,4 in diameter x 2 in height,8 oz,www.fourfatfowl.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"In the 17th century Rensselaer County, New York was colonized by Dutch settlers, who instituted a system of landholding in which landlords, or ‘patroons,’ collected rent from many tenants. The final patroon to oversee the county was named Stephen Van Rensselaer. Stephentown, where this creamery is located, was named after him. He was known as the “Good Patroon” because of the low rent he charged to his long-term tenants: 10-20 bushels of wheat per 100 acres, a day’s labor, and “four fat fowl,” the inspiration for the creamery’s name. The name also fits because of the creamery’s four-person managing team: cheesemaker Willy (previously from Coach Farm and Old Chatham Sheepherding), his wife Shaleena, who has worked in sales for multiple cheese businesses, Willy’s brother Seth, who oversees business development, and his wife Josie, assistant cheesemaker and Vice President of Marketing. After renovating an old pizzeria, the team released their first cheese, triple-cream St. Stephen, in 2014. The Jersey milk and cream used to make St. Stephen is sourced from Dutch Hollow Farms in Schodack, NY, not far from theStephentown.The use of high-butterfat Jersey milk and added Jersey cream gives St. Stephen a soft and creamy texture with a rich mouthfeel. The thick but mild rind contributes mild aromas of mushroom and sour milk, and the paste is buttery in both texture and flavor. Overall a tame yet decadent cheese.Serve with a glass of sparkling wine, a pale ale or a toasty dark beer."

Today, the cheeses are made by Sepp Barmettler. Milk for production is sourced from carefully selected small farms that are located close to the production site in Stans. Made to the same recipe as Vacherin Mont d`Or (but without the encircling strip of spruce bark), Stanser Fladä is an uncooked, unpressed cheese that is aged for approximately four weeks. Cheeses are made year round, but those produced in the autumn tend to be better. The rind is a velvety, reddish/rust color, with an undulating surface that sometimes has a dusting of white candidum mold. Cheeses are packed and sold in a wooden box, which helps retain the shape of the cheeses when mature. Stanser Fladä is at its most seductive when perfectly ripe. At this stage it becomes velvety-smooth and runny and is best simply eaten with a hunk of crusty bread. Aromas are pronounced, full and barn-yardy, but not overwhelming. Flavors are sweet and rich, with notes of hay and grass. At its peak, these flavors become complex and multi-layered, achieving greater depth."

Stichelton,Stichelton Dairy Ltd.,United Kingdom,Nottinghamshire,"8 ins diameter, 12 ins high",15-16 lbs,,Cow,,BlueFirm,Animal,Natural,,,"Stichelton is a new cheese made from an old recipe, crafted by Joe Schneider on the Welbeck Estate in Nottinghamshire using unpasteurized, organic cow`s milk. Stichelton is made following the recipe for traditional raw milk Stilton—and, in itself, this is a story with an interesting twist. The name ""Stilton"" is protected under European Union law and therefore has a number of rules attached to its production. However, in a voluntary move in 1989, the Stilton Makers Association decreed that all Stilton must be made from pasteurized milk. This decision was in response to a food scare, although the actual culprit was never established. As such, the cheese is called Stichelton. Stichelton`s production calls for very small quantities of starter culture and rennet, and the resulting delicate curd is hand-ladled from the vat to drain, and left to acidify overnight. Stichelton Dairy is a partnership between the owners of the Welbeck estate, William and Alison Parente, the cheesemaker Joe Schneider, and Neal`s Yard Dairy`s Randolph Hodgson.The idea for the cheese itself came from Randolph Hodgson, whose experience with farmhouse cheese and overwhelming interest in restoring a lost traditional cheese, led him to unite Joe`s cheesemaking skills with the estate. The Parente`s estate is home to an organic herd of 150 Friesian-Holstein cows, who provide the high quality of milk needed to make great cheese. Stichelton has a rusty-colored, orange-brown rind with indentations from the piercing needles. The interior is creamy-white, with delicate veins of blue-green mold.Flavors are fruity and reminiscent of apples, with underlying nutty, toasty notes and long-lasting savory flavors. There is also a spicy element from the blue mold. Flavors expand and develop in the mouth and have a long finish. The texture is rich and creamy with a semisoft paste."
Stilton - Colston Bassett,Colston Bassett Dairy,United Kingdom,Nottinghamshire,"8 ins diameter, 12 ins high",17 lbs, www.colstonbassettdairy.com,Cow,,FirmBlue,VegetableAnimal,Natural,,,"Located in the Vale of Belvoir in Nottinghamshire, Colston Bassett and District Dairy was founded in 1913, largely in response to a growing demand for the production of consistent and well-made cheese in a purpose built dairy. Although cheesemaking had a long history in the area prior to this, for centuries it had taken place as a seasonal occupation for farmers` wives between April and September, using milk that was surplus to the fluid milk market.In 1912, the Colston Bassett vilalge doctor, Dr William Windley, saw a way of producing quality cheese with the support of local farmers. During his rounds, he encouraged local farmers and patients to raise the capital needed to build a dairy and subscribe for shares. A total of forty people raised £1,000.00. With this, half an acre of land was purchased from the squire, Mr Knowles, and the Colston Bassett and District Dairy was built.At the outset, there were about sixteen farmer members supplying milk to the dairy and, due to war-time restrictions, the first cheese to be produced was a hard-pressed cheddar style cheese since Stilton was thought to be too much of a luxury to be produced during the war years.In 1920 the dairy started to make Stilton and, except for once again stopping during WWII to go back to the Cheddar-style cheese, by the 1950s, Stilton was produced throughout the year.Colston Bassett is one of the smallest Stilton dairies in the UK. Today, milk is sourced from four different farms, each located within 1.5 miles of the dairy, that have been supplying it since the 1920s. In most cases the farms are still operated by the original families. During that time, there have only been five Dairy Managers at Colston Bassett. Billy Kevan has been at the dairy since 1999 and is the current cheesemaker who oversees production.Colston Bassett Stilton is made in a more traditional way than most other Stiltons as the curd is still hand-ladled before draining, which preserves its structure, resulting in a luscious, creamy texture when the cheeses are mature. Also, the rind of each wheel is sealed or ""rubbed up"" by hand.Colston Bassett Stilton has a velvety, close texture with a pale, ivory paste, grading to amber at the edges and shot throughout with parsleyed greenish-blue veins.The rind is wrinkly, slightly sticky and orange-brown in color dotted with patches of white mold. Flavors are rich and lactic with a wonderful balance of blue mold, earth and butter.  When young, wheels tend to have a slightly tangy edge but with age, this dissipates."
Stinking Bishop,Charles Martell,United Kingdom,Gloucestershire,,4 lbs; 1 lb,,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"Yes, this is the cheese that revived claymation hero Wallace from his fainting spell in thatWallace & Gromit film—but the beloved British washed-rind dates way back before the release of The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. It`sbased on a very old recipe for a wheel made by Cistercian monks who once lived on the same land as modern-day Hunts Court Farm, where it`s made today. Cheesemaker Charles Martell added a twist to the original recipe, however: He uses perry cider to wash the wheels, giving them a distinctive aroma. The twist is based on the local terroir: The Gloucestershire region and its border areas are well-known for cultivating about 100 different types of perry pear, which are now used throughout the country. One such pear variety is the Stinking Bishop,named for a local 19th century farmer, Frederick Bishop, who was notorious in the area; it`s said that he once sold a cow in the local market and proceeded to drink the entire proceeds on his way home. This riotously stinky cheese, like the pear, is his namesake. To increase the moisture content and to encourage bacterial activity, salt is not added until the cheese is removed from its mold. Air bubbles form in the mold, giving the finished cheese an Emmental-like appearance when sliced.The distinctive aroma comes from the process with which the cheese is washed during its ripening; it is immersed in the perry every four weeks while it matures. The cheese is available in both one-pound and four-pound wheels.Stinking Bishop has an oozing, luscious paste ranging in color from white-yellow to beige, with a leatherlike, orangey rind.Though annual production of this cow`s milk wheel is relatively limited, its notorious odor—which is said to be similar to unwashed socks and wet towels—keeps it popular in the United Kingdom and abroad. Like many washed rinds, however, the cheese`s flavor is much more mild on the palate than the odor would imply, with notes of nuts, cream, and fruit.A perry would make a natural pair for this cheese, however it might not be sturdy enough to stand up to the stink. Try a pear liqueur, a dessert cider, or a Trappist ale. Photo Credit Eat More Cheese."

These winds have come to be known as the Roaring 40`s, and are the basis for much of the interesting history of King Island.During the 15th and 16th centuries, as the Roaring 40`s swept across the trade routes causing shipwrecks, straw mattresses from many parts of the world drifted ashore. Their seeds germinated in the rich island soils and created the lush pastures that set the King Island dairy industry apart.Today, dairy cows graze on the thick pasture, supplementing their rich diet with the occasional nibble of kelp washed ashore after heavy storms. Consequently, there is no need for the artificial feed supplements and stock growth additives that other farmers have come to rely on.Cheese production takes place under the direction of Swiss-born Ueli Berger, who has an inexhaustible passion for cheesemaking which began very early in life. As the grandson of a cheesemaker and son of a dairy farmer, his European childhood provided plenty of opportunity to explore the craft.After studying cheesemaking in Switzerland for three years, Berger moved to Australia to work for a soft cheese manufacturer. He moved to King Island in 1998 to become King Island Dairy`s head cheesemaker.King Island Dairy Stokes Point Smoked Cheddar is naturally smoked with Tasmanian hardwood.

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt (who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University), and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” Named after the Stroudwater River, which runs through the farm’s town of Westbrook, this raw cow’s milk tomme-style cheese is aged at least three months.Smell is pleasant, lactic and tangy with notes of hay. Texture of the off-white paste is creamy yet dry—smooth if a little chalky—and surrounded by a brownish rind. On the palate, an earthy flavor builds up to a late burst of lactic tang.

Parish Hill’s cheeses are inspired by the traditional cheeses of Italy. They’re handmade in small batches using raw milk, which is produced at the Elm Lea Farm at the Putney School. The farm is just five minutes down the road from the cheese house, and its milking herd grazes on fresh pasture from June to October. Parish Hill cheese production happens from May to November in order to take advantage of the pastures that give a highly aromatic quality to the milk, resulting in complex and subtle flavor variations. Milk for cheesemaking is ripened using homegrown cheese cultures, which are produced by inoculating the farm’s raw milk with pure bacterial cultures and then propagating them continuously. Traditional calf rennet is sourced from Europe and Quebec, and sea salt is sourced from the Maine Sea Salt Company in Marshfield. Suffolk Punch is a classic pasta filata cheese, made by stretching lactic fermented curd in hot water until it forms its shape. It’s modeled after Caciocavallo, a traditional Italian cheese that is famous for having been tied at the ends of a long rope and then hung over a rod to age, like saddlebacks thrown on the back of a horse. During at least two months of aging, the gourd-shaped cheeses are rubbed with olive oil and polished to create an edible rind.With a firm and smooth interior when young, Suffolk Punch becomes increasingly flaky and drier with age (some versions are aged more than six months). Flavor is buttery and tangy, developing peppery notes over time.Pair younger versions of Suffolk Punch with a Sauvignon Blanc or a Beaujolais, and more aged versions with an Amarone or Nebbiolo."

Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. Supreme was inspired by creamy French classic Délice de Bourgogne.It’s produced in a small-batch bucket method with gentle stirring and cutting to achieve a rich consistency. Wheels are aged for 9-14 days, developing a bloomy rind.Milkier and with a subtler taste than the Petite version, Supreme has a semi-soft and slightly crumbly paste that turns smooth and creamy on the palate.

In 1991, convinced there was a future for making great cheeses in America, Fermo Jaeckle, a former executive with Otto Roth & Co., joined with his cousins, Felix and Ulrich Roth, to further extend their European/Swiss roots and cheesemaking expertise into the rolling hills of Green County, Wisconsin. Known locally as Little Switzerland for its source of high quality milk, this area in the heart of Wisconsin is particularly well-suited for cheesemaking. It is here that Roth Käse USA was established, initially with a view towards making Alpine-style cheeses. Surchoix is a raw cow`s milk cheese made in the Alpine style and aged approximately ten months. It is full bodied and rich in flavor.

Named after the Dale (valley) where it was produced, the first Swaledale cheeses were made with the milk of Swaledale sheep or goats milk and it was not until the 17th Century when dairy cows were introduced into the Dales that the cheese started to be made with cow’s milk. Like most cheeses from this region, Swaledale was primarily produced on the farm with a view to home consumption, with perhaps a few excess wheels being traded or bartered locally with grocers and corn merchants in exchange for staples such as food and flour. By 1900, numerous creameries had been established in the area together with an effective system for collecting milk from the farms. This streamlining meant that suddenly Swaledale was being made in large quantities resulting in the subsequent decline of on-farm cheese production. This factor, combined with many years of adverse agricultural policy and the effects of two World Wars meant that the original farmhouse version of Swaledale was well on its way to extinction. By 1980 the only producer left making traditional Swaledale was Mr & Mrs Longstaff of Harkerside above Reeth in Swaledale. The recipe was shrouded in mystery and had been handed down Mrs Longstaff’s family for generations. In the early 1980’s, Mr Longstaff died and Mrs Longstaff decided to sell her smallholding, simultaneously retiring from cheese making. Effectively Swaledale cheese became extinct. However, in November 1986 Mrs Longstaff gave the original recipe to David & Mandy Reed and, acting as chief taster, she helped them to re-establish an authentic Swaledale cheese. The following year, David & Mandy set up The Swaledale Cheese Company and since then business has grown year on year. The company now produces approximately 1.75 tonnes of Swaledale per week. In 1995, Swaledale cheese (both the ewe`s and cow`s milk versions) were awarded name protected PDO status. In keeping with 19th century production practice, no salt is added to the curds. Instead, after unmolding the cheese is brined and allowed to mature for between six to eight weeks. During this time, mold has grown to form a natural rind and the cheese has a gentle, open texture and mild lactic flavor."

Sweet Vanilla Cardona,Carr Valley Cheese Co,United States,Wisconsin,"8 ins diameter, 3 ins high",10 lbs,www.carrvalleycheese.com,Goat,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Waxed,,,"Located in the rolling hills of central Wisconsin, Carr Valley Cheese remains one of Wisconsin`s most traditional cheese plants, famous for its Wisconsin cheddar varieties, as well as a host of more modern cheeses. Now owned and operated by Sid Cook, Carr Valley was founded in 1902, but the Cook family has been making cheese since 1883. Sid is a fourth generation cheesemaker. The first cheese plant that his father operated was in Irish Valley, where Sid worked with his father for several years before taking over the business in the mid 70`s. During this time Sid also learned how to make his own cultures from his father and grandfather. He and his brother made Wisconsin-style cheddar at that location for ten years, and Sid eventually purchased Carr Valley in 1986 and another cheesemaking facility in 1991, with a layout that would allow for more flexibility and the development of more styles of cheese. Carr Valley now sources cow`s milk from 40 farms, all located within 20 miles of the plant, and each milking no more than 70 cows. Sheep`s milk comes largely from one dairy and goat`s milk from a group of eight farms in the Green Bay area. Carr Valley makes over 65 different cheeses. Made from 100% goat’s milk with added vanilla, Sweet Vanilla Cardona is a firm, dense cheese that is bone white in color with tiny specks of vanilla throughout the paste.Made in ten pound wheels, finished cheeses are rubbed with a blend of vanilla sugar and vanilla bean.Flavors are distinctly sweet and vanilla like, with lactic notes in the background. Good wine pairings include Ice Wine, Shiraz and Pinot Noir."
Taleggio,Various,Italy,Lombardy,"10 ins square, 2 ins high",4-5 lbs,,Cow,PasteurisedRaw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-Rind,,"The ultimate Italian washed-rind, Taleggio has inspired gooey, orange-hued imitations aplenty since its invention somewhere around the ninth century. But you can only find makers of the original in regions surrounding the Val Taleggio, the cheese`s eponymous valley in mountainous Northern Italy. Taleggio was originally made only during certain months of the year, as a way to utilize excess milk as the cows made their seasonal trip to and from summer mountain pastures. While high-mountain cheeses tended to be large and firm, Taleggio was produced at lower points on the migration trail,where the temperature is slightly warmer (72 to 77°F) and the air is far more humid (90%)—much more conducive to the growth of mold on the rind. At that point the cows, sufficiently tired from their seasonal hike, would produce milk with a much higher butterfat content than that from cattle resting at pasture. While nowadays the cheese is mass-produced year-round with cows that don’t migrate, rustic artisanal cheesemakers will still follow the old method to a tee. To make the cheese, whole cow’s milk is heated to between 86 and 97°F, and animal rennet is added as a coagulant. Alternatively, some makers will introduce milk that’s already fermented, an ancient process that can be repeated almost indefinitely and save one from ever having to buy new starter cultures. After 15to 20minutes, the curds are cut, and then cut again after another ten minutes of rest. Whey is drained over a metal table, on which the curds are molded into their signature squares. Salt is applied both by hand and by way of a brine; then,the squares are transferred over to wooden shelves for aging. The cheese is turned at regular intervals for the first eighteen hours, allowing the salt to distribute and drying the rind. For the next forty days, the entire aging process, makers will regularly scrub the rind with a salt solution to spreadgood bacteria, scrub off excess,and prevent mold overgrowth, since too much can make the cheese bitter and disgusting. This is what revealsthe cheese’s characteristic terracotta hue, as the rind is mainly composed of cannibal bacteria feeding off of their predecessors, flavoring the paste, and giving Taleggio its distinctive pungent aroma.Despite the strongly aromatic washed rind, flavors are mild and buttery when young, developing a fuller, tangier flavor with prolonged maturing.The body of the cheese is soft, with only a few eyes (holes), and is a pale, straw-white color that becomes darker under the rind as the cheese matures.For the purest taste of Taleggio’s gustatory mosaic,try spreading some of the paste on a hunk of rustic bread; the rich, meaty primary flavor creates a super-savory pairing, making the subdued fruitiness of the cheese far more noticeable, but also far less intense. Inversely, if you pair Taleggio with sweet grapes, currants,pignoli(pine nuts), or a sweet wine like a red ItalianNebbiolo, the cheese becomes super-sweet, great for dessert or an early-morning breakfast."

After meeting at a potluck for Green Country Women in Sustainable Agriculture in 2012, Landmark (who had a small sheep and goat farm) and Thomas Bates (a food writer) decided to form a partnership. Landmark is in charge of cheesemaking, while Thomas-Bates is in charge of sales. The Annas currently partner with two dairies to source milk, using space rented at Clock Shadow Creamery to produce their cheese. Sheep’s milk is sourced from Sam and Abe Enloe, a team of brothers in Rewey, Wisconsin. Pasture-grazed cow’s milk is sourced from Bert Paris in Belleville, Wisconsin. Tallgrass was originally inspired by Spanish Hispanico (a cow’s milk version of Manchego), but according to Anna Thomas Bates, “the sweet, golden pasture-grazed cow`s milk we used let [the cheese] take on a character of its own.” Aged for three to six months, the wheels are rubbed repeatedly with olive oil and smoked paprika.When ready for sale, Tallgrass is creamy with notes of salted butter and a cave-aged finish.The Annas suggest serving this cheese alongside honey, preserves, quince and cured meat.

Tanasi Tomme,Bonnie Blue Farm,United States,Tennessee,"6” in diameter, 2.25” high",5 lbs,www.bonniebluefarm.com/,Goat,,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"Tanasi Tomme, a three time ACS award-winning cheese, is the result of the work of Jim and Gayle Tanner of Bonnie Blue Farm. In 2006, several years after moving from Northern California to Tennessee for retirement, the Tanners began a goat dairy, naming it after the original battle flag of the Civil War in honor of its close proximity to the Shiloh battlefield. The Tanners had been enthusiastic goat herders for years, but when they met a dairy farmer who had been born on their new Tennessee property, Gayle thought it providential. Their original herd of 11 goats expanded to 80 and an old barn was reborn as a cheese studio. Jim, a former contractor, built aging caves in the limestone hillsides on the property. Bonnie Blue became the first Grade A goat dairy in Tennessee. Today, Bonnie Blue’s herd of Nubian and Saanen goats produce around 10,000 pounds of artisan cheese every year. The goats are fed a mixture of wild grasses from browsing on pasture, supplimented with alfalfa hay and grain. The flavors of the land and hay are embodied in the cheese. In homage to the history of Tennessee, Tanasi Tomme was named after the capital of the Cherokee, from which the state took its name. It is a creation of Gayle’s, who was inspired to produce an aged cheese as a result of the cheese cave that Jim built. Each wheel of Tanasi Tomme is handcrafted by Gayle, who starts the process by spending up to four hours each day milking the does. After the milk is transferred to the cheese studio, she warms the milk and sets the curd. She then cuts the curds to pea-sized pieces and hand ladles the curd into the molds. Once the cheeses have drained, each newly formed wheel is brined and afterwards placed on wooden shelves made from ash to age. During the four-month maturing process the wheels are turned periodically.The end result is a cheese that has a smooth, but firm texture. The flavors of Tanasi Tomme are of clean hay and rich butterscotch with hints of toasted nuts and a bit of smoke.Serve it with spicy peach chutney and Hazelnut Crostini."
Tarentais (France),,France,Savoie,"2.5 ins diameter, 4 ins high",1 lb,,Goat,,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,,,"Made in the Tarentais Valley in the Savoie region of South Eastern France, Tarentais is a small cylindrical cheese made from raw goat`s milk. Production of Tarentais is usually `fermier` or farmhouse and as such, cheeses are only made on a small-scale by various cheesemakers throughout the region. Raw milk is allowed to acidify and coagulate before being very gently ladled into cylindrical molds or forms. The gentle handling of the curd ensures that as much moisture as possible is retained which, when combined with the slow, natural drainage of the whey, results in Tarentais` delicate, yet dense, texture. Cheeses mature for between 15 days to three months before release with those found in the United States being at least two months old. During the early stages of the ripening they are washed with a local white wine. If allowed to mature to an age of about four weeks, a dusting of blue, yellow and white molds often appears on the rind together with slight brown patches. The interior of the cheese is silky and dense. As Tarentais matures, two distinct textures develop with the interior of the cheese remaining ivory white in color while, just under the rind, where the cheese starts to `break down` and develop, a darker stripe appears, encasing the paler interior. Flavors intensify with age. When eaten young at about two to three weeks, cheeses are fresh, citrus-like and tangy becoming more piquant with distinct almond notes at about six weeks."
Tarentaise (Spring Brook),Spring Brook Farm,United States,Vermont,"15 ins diameter, 3.25 ins high",18 lbs, www.sbfcheese.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Washed,,,"Spring Brook Farm, owned by Jeremy Stephenson, is a traditional dairy farm located in Reading, Vermont. The farm spans more than 500 acres and is home to 100 registered Jersey cows. The 42 milking cows produce over 600,000 lbs. of milk each year, now used to make artisanal Tarentaise cheese.Originally produced at neighboring Thistle Hill Farm, Tarentaise was so successful that Thistle Hill cheesemakers John and Janine Putnam partnered with Jeremy and Spring Brook Farm, as well as the Farms for City Kids Foundation, to expand production. The business arrangement between the two farms and the foundation is unique. As part of a licensing agreement, Spring Brook Farm and the Farms for City Kids Foundation can make Tarentaise, and call it by this name, as long as it`s made according to certain stipulations. The milk must come from Jersey breed cows, the cows must graze on local pasture when weather permits, fermented feed is prohibited, copper-lined vats must be used, the milk must be raw and the cheese must be a ""Farmstead Cheese"" (according to the definition used by the American Cheese Society).Tarentaise is a semi-hard ‘Alpine’ style cheese modeled afterits French cousins Abondance and Beaufort. It ismade from fresh, raw milk that flows directly from the milking barn adjacent to the creamery into twin copper vats.After coagulation, the curds and whey are moved to the gravity-fed molds by means of a vacuum system, identical to the system used by small and medium sized producers of the Savoie and Comté regions of France. Molds are filled, allowed to drain, and then moved to an adjacent press.After pressing the cheeses are brined and ready for aging in Spring Brook`s aging room, adjacent to the make (production) room.Spring Brook`s Tarentaise is slightly different than thatof its sister farm Thistle Hill, primarily in its texture-- a difference Jeremy Stephenson attributes to variationsin pressing and other subtle differences in the make process,as well as the fact that the milk is sourced from different farms.As John Putnam of ThistleHill stated on a radio program before Spring Brook Farm had made itsfirst pound of cheese, ""we know the cheese will be different and wewill celebrate that difference."" According to Jeremy, “this is the beautyand appeal of a raw milk farmstead cheese. Theseasons, the land and the direct input from the hand of the cheesemaker are reflected through the milk. All these subtleties combined result in a complex and nuanced product.”Tarentaise has the classic nuttiness of a traditional Alpine cheese, with complex layers of flavor, underscored with herbaceous, savory, vegetal notes.Pair it with Alsatian whites (Pinot Gris, Riesling, Gewurtztraminer), or with English Brown Ales such as Samuel Smith`s Nut Brown."
Tarentaise (Thistle Hill),Thistle Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,"14 ins diameter, 4 ins high",20 lbs, www.thistlehillfarm.com,Cow,,Hard,Animal,Washed,,,"Thistle Hill Farm Tarentaise is an aged, raw milk, organic cheese made by John and Janine Putnam at their family farm in North Pomfret, Vermont. Certified organic milk comes from the farm`s grass-fed Jersey cows.Thistle Hill Farm Tarentaise is made using a copper cheese vat in the tradition of cheesemaking the Tarentaise Valley in the Savoie region of the French Alps. The copper vat, essential to developing the proper flavor, is one of only a few in the United States, and was custom built for Thistle Hill Farm in Switzerland.Following in the footsteps of the cheesemakers of the Savoie, Thistle Hill Farm Tarentaise is made using imported French cultures that give the cheese its character while aging. Also, the Putnam`s follow the traditional Savoie process of making their own rennet, using the whey from the previous cheesemaking.For production, the curds are carefully taken from the copper vat and given an initial pressing for ten minutes, referred to as the ""forepress"" in order to expel some of the whey. Afterwards, each young wheel is cut into quarters and each quarter placed into a Tarentaise mold or form where it undergoes a second pressing at a pressure of 65lbs for two and a half hours. After unmolding, the cheeses are wrapped in a cheesecloth and transferred to a `heat room` where they`re turned (flipped) and left to sit overnight. Early the next morning, the wheels are brined for about 3 hours before being transferred to the aging room.In order to produce a traditional Tarentaise, the Putnams imported the correct size molds from France to create a cheese approximately 14 inches in diameter and four inches high, with the concave sides similar to Beaufort, Abondance and Tarentaise cheeses.Cheeses range in age from four months and up, with six months considered optimal. The aging room contains only Tarentaise cheese and its atmosphere is carefully adjusted to foster the development of Tarentaise`s characteristics.During the aging process, the cheeses are washed twice each week to develop the natural rind and butterscotch color.The flavors of Tarentaise can be quite assertive and complex. Forward fruit flavors are apparent, with an underlying caramel sweetness, earthy notes and nuts."
Taula,Caseificio Bertagni,Italy,Tuscany,"6 ins diameter,  3-4 ins high",3-4 lbs,www.caseificiobertagni.com,Sheep,,Hard,Animal,Natural,,,"Made by Caseificio Bertagni near Pieve Fosciana in the province of Lucca, Italy, Taula is an aged sheep’s milk cheese, similar in style to a pecorino. Milk for production comes from the (somewhat rare) breeds of Massese and Garfagnina sheep and is sourced from seventeen small farms, located high in the mountains between Northern Toscana and Emilia Romagna. This mountain range is known as ""Appennino Tosco Emiliano"" and the majority of the farms are situated at an altitude of over 3,000 feet. Caseificio Bertagni is owned and run by Bruno Bertagni and his son Verano. Although they make a variety of cheeses, Taula is one of the most traditional cheeses of ""Alta Garfagnana"", the highest part of Toscana region. In the local dialect, ""Taula"" means `a wooden table specifically for cheese maturing`. Upon arrival at the creamery, the milk is pasteurized at 161-165° F (72-74°C) for 15 seconds. It is then allowed to cool to 95-104° F (35-40°C), when the starter cultures are added. After a short period of waiting to allow the cultures to become fully active, rennet is added to coagulate the milk. This normally takes about 40 minutes, at which point the curd is cut with a special cheese “harp” (known as a “chitarra”), and left to rest for 10 minutes, soaking in the whey. The curd is further broken down with a special implemt called a “spino” – the same instrument that is used for the production of Parmigiano Reggiano – which looks rather like a giant balloon whisk on the end of a pole. Simultaneously, the curds and whey are re-heated and cooked at a temperature of 107°F (42 °C ). At the end of this process, each piece of curd is about the size of a grain of rice. The curds are then transferred to the cheese molds and kept at a temperature of 100°F (38 °C ) for four hours. This allows the pH level to get to the desired 5.1, at which point the cheeses are dry salted by hand. The following day, the cheeses are taken out of their molds and transferred to maturing rooms where they’re kept at a temperature of 46-50° F (8-10°C) for a minimum of 60 days. The texture of Taula is very firm and pleasantly waxy. The exterior rind is a dark beige color with the interior slightly lighter. Flavors are very rich, earthy and balanced with notes of hay, caramel and nuts. This would pair very well with a medium weight Chianti Classico, Pinot Noir or Rhone wine."

Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States. After nearly three decades of growing the business, Chenel sold her company in 2006 to French family cheese producers, Laiteries H. Triballat, who continue the tradition of Laura Chenel’s cheesemaking of both fresh and aged cheese. Milk for production comes from family goat dairies located in the western United States.High quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure animal health, nutrition and general well being. One of the first aged cheeses that Chenel created, Taupinière was her American interpretation of the cheesemaking traditions she learned in France. Each round of Taupinère is formed into a nine-ounce round that is then coated with vegetable ash and aged for about eight to 12 days before release, which allows the wrinkly Geotrichum candidummold to grow.The interior texture is bright white in color and pleasantly chalky when young, becoming softer under the rind as the cheese ages.Flavors are fresh and lemony, with sweeter, smooth milky notes on the finish and an underlying lactic tang.Pair with a sancerre or a wheat beer."

They are one of the few artisanal cheesemakers in Utah. Having previously worked in the worlds of software and real estate, both men harbored a belief in revitalizing the concept of the local creamery. With the help of The Western Dairy Center at Utah State University, they began to turn their vision into reality. Pat and Tim built the family owned and operated creamery from the ground up. Jersey cow’s milk, known for its high butterfat content, is sourced from Wadeland South Dairy, located about 10 miles from the creamery. The milk arrives from Wadeland at about midnight when it’s just a few hours old. Cheesemaking begins almost immediately, starting with pasteurization and the addition of starter cultures. After being left to ‘ripen’, microbial rennet is added to coagulate the milk, which is then hand cut. The excess whey is drained off and the remaining curds are “cheddared” to achieve the right moisture and pH level before being put through a mill and finally transferred into molds for pressing. Hand-rubbed with black tea and bergamot, the flavors of TeaHive combine to produce an aromatic cheese with a delicate fragrance of orange blossoms. The rich, milky flavor imparted by the Jersey milk is balanced by a clean sparkling finish that lingers on the palate. Wine pairing suggestions include fruit-forward or floral wines, blonde beers and scotch. TeaHive pairs well with savory scones, biscuits, or marmalade."
Ted,Kenny's Farmhouse Cheese,United States,Kentucky,,8 lbs,kennyscheese.com,Cow,,Hard,Microbial,Natural,Cheddar-like,,"Father-and-son team Kenny and Jared Mattingly have run Kenny’s Farmhouse Cheese out of their farm in the hills of Barren County, Kentucky since 1998. While the farmstead has been milking on the land for 40 years, the family decided to make cheese about 20 years ago to sustain the dairy farm. Kenny, the founder, still manages the dairy farm, creamery, and team. The methods used and scale of the operation have changed over the past few decades, but the farm’s commitment to harvesting high quality milk and producing fantastic cheese have not. Their mixed-breed herd—including Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss cows—spends most of its time grazing outside on fresh pasture, or munching on high-quality alfalfa hay.  “Ted” was inspired by rustic British cheddars and named after Kenny’s grandfather, “Tennessee Ted,"" a burly iron worker whose jobs ranged from helping build railroads in Alaska to skyscrapers in New York City. In his memory, Kenny and Jared decided this wooly-rinded cheddar style was the appropriate cheese to carry on Ted’s name. The cheddar is versatile and not incredibly delicate, a perfect table cheese.  Kenny’s started making Ted around three years ago after constructing a room for aging blue cheeses. Before being made into cheese, the milk is inoculated with some roquefort cultures to allow rind development further along in the process. The cheddar is larded early in the blue room to keep the rind from cracking, then constantly brushed and turned for even ripening. Ted is sold after eight to 12 months of aging.  The color and flavor of each wheel depend on what time of year the cows were milked. Batches made when the cows are grazing more heavily, from early spring to early winter, have deeper yellow paste and a grassier flavor, while winter wheels trend more sharp.This cheese yields buttery caramel notes and slightly piquant flavors of cave and earth closer to its rind.Pair it with a Normandy cider, a spicy rye whisky, grilled peaches, milk chocolate, or wildflower honey."

They loved it so much that they tracked down the creamery in the hopes of meeting the cheesemaker. “We thought: we can do a local version,” Hicks says. “And we held onto this idea for almost a decade!” And so many years after purchasing Toluma Farms’ 160 acres of rolling green hills, launching a sheep dairying operation on the property, and later building Tomales Farmstead Creamery, the duo released Teleeka. It’s the first cheese they’ve made using three types of milk: from Toluma’s herds of sheep and goats, plus creamy Jersey cow’s milk that’s sourced from a neighbor’s farm two miles down the road. Like all of the Marin County-based creamery’s cheeses, this one’s name, which translates to “three,” draws from the language of the coastal region’s original inhabitants: the Miwok. “From everything we’ve come to learn about this tribe we know they took excellent care of the land,” says Hicks. “Since we have so many school age tours, we wanted to educate people about those who lived on this land and had such great respect for it—and also teach some of the few words that are still known.”This cute little moldy cube has a thick, oozing creamline and a fluffy popcorn-yellow inner paste. Aromas are of cultured butter, grass, and acid. We love how the buttery creamline plays off the slightly gamy, bitter inner paste, the cow’s milk lending a general creaminess while tempering the more barnyardy sheep’s and goat’s milks.Tamara Hicks suggests pairingTeleekawith sweet maui onions and truffles."
Telemea,Various,Romania,Various,,,,SheepCow,PasteurisedRaw,Firm,Animal,None,,,"Telemea is a traditional Romanian brined cheese made from cow’s milk and/or sheep’s milk. Originally brought to the Eastern European country by the Vlach peoples, the Latin descendants of modern-day Romanians, Telemea has grown to become the country’s most popular cheese. Similar cheeses are also found throughout the Balkans and north of the Danube, but the original Telemea is now protected as a traditional Romanian product with a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status in Europe. Several varieties of the product are protected from different regions, includingArges, Brasov, Carei, Harghita, Huedin, Oas, Sibiu and Vâlcea. In production of Telemea, rennet is used to curdle milk and the curd is removed and pressed overnight in cheesecloth before being cut into squares. The squares are then left to mature in a brine solution. Before it’s a few weeks old, the cheese can be sold fresh, known simply as cas. But to become Telemea, it must mature in brine for up to six more months, stored in wooden barrels called putini. Sometimes it’s spiced with cumin seeds before sale.With a wet crumbly consistency reminiscent of feta, Telemea is creamy, salty and tangy. A perfect table cheese, it’s often used in salads.Pair cow’s milk Telemea with a Romanian Feteasca Regala wine. The sheep’s milk version would go well with a Romanian Sole Chardonnay."

The family home, a castle with three towers, is reflected in Casa Madaio’s distinct logo. Mr. Madaio feels that the towers not only represent the home, but also the connection of the past with the future. To him, the towers symbolize his three children Angelo, Renata and David and the future of Casa Madaio. At Casa Madaio, both cheese production and the cheese aging facility are small scale. The business is centered at two different locations. The cheese making facilities are in Eboli, along with the central office, while the aging caves are located at Castelcivita, in the heart of the The National Park of Cilento and Vallo of Diano. The area is steeped in history. The caves have been used to age cheeses by the Madaio family for four generations, and the company places great value on the preservation of the history and flavors of the land, working closely with local universities and with the Slow Food movement to further research. Their cheeses are primarily sold to small specialty shops and restaurants, both in Italy and abroad. Casa Madaio makes both fresh goat and buffalo milk cheeses at their location in Eboli. In addition, they also purchase cheeses made at small mountain dairies nearby that they age themselves at Castelcivita. Teneri is a fresh Buffalo milk Ricotta. It is produced by adding fresh Buffalo milk to the whey left over from producing Mozzarella di Bufala and heating the mixture until Ricotta curds develop. Those curds are skimmed from the top and put into molds. Therefore, technically, Ricotta is actually cheese curds rather than an aged cheese.Teneri is a Ricotta that has the aroma of flowers and hazelnuts, with a clean flavor that is delicate. Teneri has a soft, slightly sticky texture. Pair Teneri with sparkling white wines. It is highly recommended to have with Asprinio d`aversa, but unfortunately, this wine is only found in Naples and the surrounding area of southern Italy. A more widely distributed wine is from the Greco Bianco grape variety; a variety that is almost exactly a match to Asprinio.   Teneri is best used as a dessert. Pair it with fruit jam or in lighter, simpler desserts to be showcase its flavor."

The MoonRabbit,Deer Creek Cheese / Artisan Cheese Exchange,United States,Wisconsin,5 in height x 12 in diameter,22 lbs,www.deercreekcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,FirmFlavor Added,Microbial,Flavor Added,Cheddar-like,,"The MoonRabbit sprang forth in October 2015. On its label, which holds together the wheel’s vivid green wrapping, a rabbit stares into a full, green moon. Chris Gentine, a Wisconsin-based cheese grader and owner of the Artisan Cheese Exchange, recalls a story of his grandmother’s, in which the moon was made of green cheese—so he set out to create one.   To make The MoonRabbit, the first in Deer Creek’s Spirits Collection, Gentine takes his cheddar, which is aged for two years until it’s sweet and creamy—then soaks it in Green Chartreuse. The liqueur, known as the “elixir of life,” has been produced by Charthusan monks since 1737 and is made using 130 distilled herbs and plants. Its distinctive tint and fragrance tinges the cheese with a light green color and adds an herbal essence that complements the cheese’s slight sweetness.  Chris Gentine began The Artisan Cheese Exchange as a bridge between small cheesemakers from the United States and the rest of the world, carefully culling through American cheeses to find the best options to export. But seeing a hole in the market for sweet, aged cheddars, Gentine began his proprietary brand, Deer Creek Cheese.  Deer Creek focuses on creating whimsical, flavorful cheeses that each tell their own stories. To illustrate their unique perspective, Deer Creek opts for labels that are hand-drawn by Gentine’s daughter. They create classics, like the clothbound cheddars of their Signature Originals Collection, but experiment with exciting flavor combinations: from spicy habanero in The Rattlesnake, to smooth Madagascar vanilla in The Doe. Starts like a milky sweet cheddar but finishes with an herbaceous echo. Overall, sweet and tangy with bodacious herbal chartreuse notes. It’s like eating cheese while smelling a cup of liqueur. It is its own cocktail: subtle, but the aftertaste is undeniable.A bijou cocktail of course! Or an amber ale—those malts love a cheddar, and the cheese`s herbaceous notes will pick up some extra special flavors in the beer."

Having dabbled in home cheesemaking, Martin converted her husband’s 260-square-foot office into a Grade A processing plant and began crafting fresh, unripened cheese from the farm’s non-homogenized, slow-pasteurized milk, using vegetarian rennet and cheesecloth hung by hand. Martin’s attention to ingredients shows in The Valley Fromage Blanc—blended with homemade peach preserves, chopped almonds, and honey, “all of the best things we grow here in the Central Valley of California,” she says. Martin crafts just two 125-gallon batches of fromage blanc in six varieties per week.All Dairy Goddess farmstead cheeses boast a mild, smooth tang and fluffy, light-as-air texture, thanks in part to Martin’s “happy cow” feed: grains and grasses grown on-site, plus fresh citrus, almond, and other nutrients daily. But sweet fruit and savory nuts set The Valley Fromage Blanc apart at competition. “Not every batch is exactly the same,” Martin says. “You might get a big chunk of peach in there, which is a real treat.”The Valley Fromage Blanc sings on plain crackers, “but I love it on gingersnaps,” Martin says. She also enjoys it with apples, pears, figs, and dates. Wilson Creek Winery in Southern California serves the cheese alongside almond champagne—but really, any bubbly will do."
Thomasville Tomme,Sweet Grass Dairy,United States,Georgia,"4” tall, 7” diameter",5-6 lbs,www.sweetgrassdairy.com,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Founded by Al and Desiree Wehner in 2000, Sweet Grass Dairy is steeped in dairy farming tradition. Since their arrival in the U.S. from Germany, successibe generations of Al’s family have been dairy farmers in New York State. However, when Al moved to Georgia to attend college in the early 1970s, the warm winters combined with meeting his future wife, Desiree, persuaded Al to stay.For the first 20 years of its existence, the property that is now Sweet Grass Dairy was a conventional dairy farm. In the early 1990s, the Wehners attended a seminar at a dairy conference on rotational grazing that changed everything. Inspired by the concept of rotating the herd through different paddocks each day, the Wehners reinvented their entire farm by reducing the number of cows in their herd, investing in irrigation systems, and eventually taking cheesemaking courses in California. This transformed Sweet Grass Dairy into the farm that it is today. In addition, they also acquired a small herd of goats.Fast forward to 2002, when Al and Desiree’s daughter Jessica and her husband Jeremy began working on the farm. Having left budding careers in food and marketing in 2005, Jessica and Jeremy officially purchased the farm from her parents. Under their ownership, Sweet Grass has expanded its cheese-making operations and has now gained national recognition.With a rustic rind that looks like a tumbled stone, and a butter-yellow paste with small eyes dotted throughout, Thomasville Tomme is a very attractive cheese. It is Sweet Grass’ homage to their hometown of Thomasville and was inspired by the Tomme cheeses of the French Pyrenees. Using raw cow’s milk contributes to its complex flavors of salted butter with savory undertones and a tangy finish.Aged for at least 60 days, Thomasville Tomme has a rich, smooth paste with a toothsome snap when bitten into. Its aroma is of tangy crème fraiche combined with the smell of a cool, damp cellar.This cheese pairs very well with beers that have a good amount of hops, especially IPAs. It can also pair successfully with light fruit forward reds such as Pinot Noir or Syrah."

In order to cave age his cheeses, Mr. Guffanti purchased an abandoned silver mine in the Varese province of Italy. When his sons, Carlo and Mario took over the business in the early 20th century, they began exporting their cheese to Argentina, California and other regions where large numbers of Lombards and Peidmontese had emigrated. Today, while Guffanti is still famous for its Gorgonzola, they also make and ages a wide variety of cheeses sourced from other Italian producers, that are sold both within Italy and abroad. Three Milk Cenere is a spin on the classic Piedmont Robiola. It has the same off-white paste that is dense, rich and coats the tongue in the same way as Robiola. The largest difference between Piedmonte Robiola and Three Milk Cenere, is that with the rind of Cenere is coated in a dark grey ash as opposed to the Robiola’s furrowed white bloomy rind. Cenere is also made in Puglia as opposed to Piedmont, where Robiola is normally produced and the cheese has different proportions.It also has deep earthy and savory flavors cobined with a slight acidity that is frequently found in mixed milk cheeses. This cheese is complex enough to stand up to fruity red wines such as some Pinot Noirs as well as fruity white wines such as Sauvignon Blancs. It can be extremely nice paired with champagne or with lagers as well. When combined with crusty bread and pepper jam, or fresh fruit and walnuts it is a lovely table cheese."

The origins of the farm started in 1993 when Raynald Hebert and his wife Laurie Goodheart transformed an old farmstead, developing a small cheesemaking facility and enough acreage to support approximately thirty goats. The name “Nettle Meadow” was a reflection of the presence of wild nettles and herbs that made up the goat’s diet. Twelve years later in 2005, the farm was sold to Sheila and Lorraine, both of whom had been living in California and were wanting a complete change of direction. Since 2005 they have worked extensively to expand the farm and its operation. Now spanning 50 acres, it is home to over 300 Alpine, Nubian, Saanen and mixed breed goats, several dozen Icelandic and East Freisian sheep and a variety of other farm animals. In 2012, estimated cheese production will be about 125,000 pounds of cheese. Sheila and Lorraine are passionate supporters of the farming lifestyle, animals and cheese and run the farm with the assistance of Shiela’s mother Joan together with eight employees. Made from a blend of sheep, cow and goat’s milk, Three Sisters is a mold-ripened cheese produced in a small round weighing between 3-6 oz.With a compact texture, flavors are balanced and complex and vary according to season with grassy, herbaceous notes predominating during the summer months and more subtle flavors of hay during the winter."

In the process of searching for a good milk source in order to begin making cheese, they found that they were unable to get the quality that they wanted. So, the decision was made to buy a small herd of Jersey cows and a 37-acre farm to ensure that the cows could be pasture-fed. Thus was born Chapel Hill Creamery and, in July of 2000, the first batch of cheese was produced.Today, Portia and Flo focus on the health of their herd of 30 cows as much as the quality of the cheese that they produce. Rotational grazing is practiced on the farm and they limit milking to March through December. The results are hard to argue with, three World Jersey Cheese Awards in 2012.Thunder Mountain Swiss is Chapel Hill’s take on alpine cheeses such as Emmentaler. It is named after a local high point near the farm. The aroma of Thunder Mountain is lingering and floral. Its deep yellow paste has large round eyes and a sweet, butterscotch flavor that finishes cleanly. The cheese has been aged for enough time to form crystalline structures in the otherwise smooth, but crumbly paste. These crystals give a pleasant crunch to a bite through the dense paste.A richly flavored cheese deserves a richly flavored wine. Pair this one with a rich white wine such as an oaked Chardonnay. Try eating this cheese with some roasted nuts or Cajeta (goat’s milk caramel) for an extra layer of decadence."

Timanoix,Abbaye Notre Dame de Timadeuc,France,Brittany,"4 ins diameter, 1.5 ins high",10 oz,www.abbaye-timadeuc.fr,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Produced by the Trappist monks at the Abbaye Notre Dame de Timadeuc in the town of Brehan in Brittany, northern France, Timanoix is semi-soft, cow’s milk cheese. In many respects, Timanoix is a classic monastic cheese, meaning that it belongs to the washed-rind, slightly pungent, family of cheeses, frequently made and sold by monasteries or abbeys using milk from their own herds of animals or from a neighbor. The cheeses also provide a welcome source of income. Made from pasteurized cow’s milk, the aspect that sets Timanoix apart is that after production the cheeses are regularly washed with a solution of walnut liqueur (also made by the monks) and brine. The saltiness of the brine helps to promote the growth of the rind, while the cheese simultaneously takens on the distinct flavors imparted by the walnut liqueur. (The “noix” in Timanoix means “nut” in French.) The resulting cheeses are quite small, about 10oz each, with a richly dark-colored, yet thin rind and very distinct aromas of earth, leather and walnuts. The interior texture of the cheese is semi-soft and smooth and is a pale straw color, becoming darker towards the rind. Flavors are a wonderful balance of spicy sweetness, with savory, meaty and herbaceous notes and just the faintest hint of bitterness at the end. A really unique and delicious cheese."

They now produce some cheeses made entirely from cow`s milk, as well as some made with a blend of the two milk types. Their cheeses include Timberdoodle, Weston Tomme, Cloud 9 and Summer Snow. Timberdoodle is made from either 100% cow`s milk (during the winter months), a blend of cow`s and sheep`s milk (fall and spring) or 100% sheep`s milk (summer). Cheeses are washed with brine as they age, which gives the rind a golden-red appearance, interspersed with a light dusting of white candidum mold. Due to the seasonal changes with the milk blends and composition, flavors vary quite markedly during the year. Cheeses made with pure sheep`s milk carry sweeter, more herbaceous notes, while the cow`s milk versions have a decidedly more buttery and rounded flavor."

Toma (Point Reyes),Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co,United States,California,"9 ins diameter, 4 ins high",10 lbs,http://pointreyescheese.com/,Cow,,Firm,Microbial,Natural,,,"Located in in Marin County, just one hour north of San Francisco, California, the Giacomini family are third generation dairy farmers and have had a presence in Point Reyes area for many decades. A descendant of Italian mountain dairy producers, Bob Giacomini began milking cows on his Point Reyes dairy in 1959. Over the years, Bob and his wife Dean, together with their four daughters, Karen, Diana, Lynn and Jill, developed a shared vision of producing an all-natural farmstead cheese. This dream was realized in August, 2000, when they founded Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company and produced the first vat of their now famous Original Blue. Milk comes from the Giacomini`s own closed herd of Holstein cows that graze organically certified pastures overlooking Tomales Bay. Following on the heels of their success with the Original Blue, the Giacomini family decided to create their version of a classic Italian cow’s milk table cheese. The arrival of a new cheesemaker, Kuba Hemmerling, in 2009 allowed the business to expand its cheesemaking operation and since Hemmerling had some experience making hard cheeses in the Gouda style, this seemed a natural progression. The result is Toma. Milk for production of Toma is pasteurized, and after the curd is formed and cut, Hemmerling uses a traditional gouda technique of washing the curds with water which slows down the acidification process. The curds are then drained, placed into gouda-shaped cheese molds and pressed before being unmolded and allowed to sit in a brine solution for two days. Brining helps to harden the exterior and promote the development of a rind.With each wheel weighing in at approximately 10lb, Toma is a firm cheese with rich, buttery and grassy flavors and a slightly tangy finish. Toma is an ideal cheese for melting in pastas and risottos or on top of soups, grilled vegetables and meats.According to Jill Giacomini Basch, a near perfect pairing for Toma is Hop Stoopid Ale, a highly hopped brew from Lagunitas Brewing Co."

Tome des Bauges,Various,France,Savoie,7 in diameter x 1.5 in height,2.5 lbs,www.tome-des-bauges.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Tome des Bauges is a traditional cheese from the Savoie region of France. Produced in the mountains since the 17th century, its name translates in the local dialect to “toma cheese made in the pastures.” Indeed, the Abondance, Montbeliard and Tarentaise native breed cows, whose milk is used to produce Tome des Bauges, are fed only with pasture grass and local hay. Since 2002 the diet of the cows and production process of the cheese must follow specific guidelines, which are outlined in the regulations of the AOP (Appellation d’Origine Protegée). Cheese production happens once per day, using the cream skimmed off the top of the previous evening’s milk, which has been left in a cauldron (called bagnolet) overnight to promote acidification, as well as the milk of that morning. After rennet is added and milk coagulates, curd is cut with a manual slicer (a tranche caillé), stirred and heated to obtain the desired structure, and then placed in molds (either manually or using automated equipment). After pressing and turning, the cheese is either dry salted or brined (brining happens usually in smaller dairies), and is then aged for a minimum of five weeks. During aging the wheels are periodically turned and gently rubbed to control the growth of the fuzzy brown mold that proliferates on the surface. This mold is called mucor, also known as ‘cat hair’. The surface of the cheese develops a striking appearance, wrinkly and grey-brown with irregular patches of yellow and red. The rind is 2-3mm thick. Paste of the cheese is slightly firm and soft, with a yellow color.Tome des Bauges has an earthy, woodsy scent with hints of ammonia. Taste is creamy and rounded, with deep aromas of mushrooms, butter and grass.Pair Tome des Bauges with a dry Vermouth."

Laura Chenel was one of a small group of women cheesemakers to spearhead the production of goat`s milk cheeses in the United States. Having always been passionate about goats, Laura started her dairy in a former snail-processing plant in Santa Rosa. In 2006 she sold the company to French family cheese producers, Laiteries H. Triballat, who continue the tradition of Laura Chenel’s cheesemaking of both fresh and aged cheese. Milk for production comes from family goat dairies located in California and Nevada. High quality milk is crucial to excellent cheese production and the company has very close relationships with their producers to ensure excellent animal health, nutrition and general well being. Having decided to make a Tome style cheese (Tome literally translates to “wheel” in French), Laura sought the advice of neighbor Ignacio “Ig” Vella, a second generation cheesemaker whose family created the iconic “American Original” Dry Jack. Laura was looking to produce a cheese similar in style and texture to Dry Jack, with its nutty aroma and sweet caramel finish and with Ig’s help, she created just that. It is a recipe that continues today with the cheese made in exactly the same way. Made in wheels weighing between 3-4 lbs, the Tome has rounded sides and a distinctive indentation on the underside where the cheesecloth is brought tightly up and tied into a knot before being pressed. After production, wheels are aged for a minimum of six months before release. The texture of Tome is firm, smooth and dense while simultanously being slightly crumbly in the mouth. There is no rind and the interior paste is the color of dark ivory.Flavors are deliciously savory, with distinctive “hits” of cooked cream finishing with perfectly balanced notes of salt and sweet.Pair with a California Pinot Noir from Carneros, where the cheese is made."

Tomme de Chèvre de Savoie,Various,France,"Savoie, Haute Savoie",,10 oz,,Goat,Raw,Firm,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"Tomme de Chèvre is produced in the Savoie region of the French Alps. The firm, round pressed cheese is made from raw goat’s milk. Producers of the traditional cheese have recently organized themselves into an association in order to pursue a French Appellation d’Origine such as AOP or IGP: a process that would certify the name and strictly delineate the cheese’s production process and quality characteristics. However until now, the process is on hold due to the fact that the word “tomme” is relatively common, existing throughout France. Literally translating into “wheel” or “round,” it can be applied to as many as 100 different French cheeses. The common factor uniting all “tommes” is that the production of each results in a small/medium-sized mountain-style (i.e. firm-textured, ideal for aging) cheese. Like the similar cow’s milk Tomme de Savoie IGP, which is produced in the same region, Tomme de Chèvre is allowed to develop a natural rind during an aging period of at least seven weeks. The microbes that colonize a wheel’s surface are simply present in the environment of the cheese cave, passed on from one wheel to another. The cheese develops a characteristic fluffy gray rind, which often exhibits colorful patches and which is patted down gently before release. The microbes are so prolific that the cheeses must be aged in a separate cave from other varieties, and usually the person responsible for maintaining that cave doesn’t spend any time around other cheeses, so as not to spread the microbes.Tomme de Chèvre is covered with a thick suede-like gray rind that is frequently dotted with patches of yellow, red and white-colored mold. The interior paste of the cheese is ivory-colored, while texture is pliable and smooth. Aromas of the rind are pungent and barnyardy, reminiscent of animals, earth and wet leaves. Fondant on the palate, taste is sweet upfront, with sour citrusy notes kicking in after a moment. When the tanginess and tongue-numbing pungency fades, aromas of butter, peach and hazelnut linger.Pair it with a white wine from the Savoie, such as a Chignin, an Apremont or Roussette."
Tomme de Chèvre des Pyrenées,,France,Pyrenees,"10 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",4 lbs,,Goat,,Firm,Animal,Washed,,,"For centuries, the Pyrenées have been associated with the production of excellent sheep`s milk cheeses. However, for various reasons, goat`s milk cheeses like the Tomme de Chèvre des Pyrenées are rare.Made in small quantities only in the Ariege region, cheese production involves the curd being wrapped in cloth, drained and then lightly pressed to expel the whey. The ensuing, drier texture helps the cheese keep longer.When mature, Tomme de Chèvre des Pyrenées is dense and solid, with a firm, white smooth, compact paste. The maker`s mark - a heart - is embossed on the rind.The flavor is rich and complex, with tones of fruit, salt and citrus. The cheese has a delicious caramel, nutty finish that leaves you wanting more."

Crayeuse means ""chalky"" in French, and in this instance refers to the somewhat chalky center of the cheese.Crayeuse is made from pasteurized cow`s milk in the style of Tomme de Savoie. The rind is gray-brown and suede-like in appearance, dotted with areas of yellow and white mold.The interior paste is slightly off-white and chalky in the middle, extending to a smoother texture towards the rind.Tomme de Crayeuse has gentle, pleasant earthy flavors of damp cellar and mushrooms that are underpinned by a lemony, citrus note.This cheese pairs well with a gentle, smooth red such as a Rhône or Pinot Noir."
Tomme de Fedou,,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"10 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",4-5 lbs,,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Natural,,,"Produced at Lozere, in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, near Hyelzas, Tomme de Fedou is a raw sheep`s milk cheese. The area of production is about 3,000ft. above sea level, on a plateau that covers about 130 square miles.Production takes place seven days a week, and the sheep`s milk is sourced from 13 producers in the area, who have formed a co-op. Farmers are paid according to the quality of the milk and, as such, if the farmers are able to provide better milk, which depends on the animals` diet and general husbandry, they receive more money.A total of approximately 1,700-2,500 litres of milk is taken to the dairy in Lozere for cheese productionDuring production, the curds are hand-ladled into forms and pressed. Cheeses are then aged for between three and six months prior to sale.The rind of the cheese is pale, gray-brown in color with a slightly pitted appearance. The paste is smooth and ivory-cream colored, close textured with occasional small holes.Flavors associated with Tomme de Fedou are characteristically sweet and nutty, with slight, milky lanolin notes and savory flavors of herbs and grass, especially from cheeses roduced in the summer months."
Tomme de Haut-Richeliu,Fromagerie Fritz Kaiser,Canada,Quebec,"3” tall, 10” diameter",4 ½ lbs,www.fkaiser.com,Goat,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Washed,,,"Founded by Fritz Kaiser in 1981, Fromagerie Fritz Kaiser is located near the U.S. border in Noyan, Canada. M. Kaiser was born in Switzerland, but moved to Quebec at a young age. He is most famous for producing Canada’s first version of Raclette, which highlights his focus on bringing traditional Swiss cheeses to Canada.The Fromagerie produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat’s milk, many of which are unique washed rind cheeses. Four of the 25 cheeses that Fromagerie Fritz Kaiser produces have won major awards including those from the World Cheese Competition, American Cheese Society and Grand Prix de Fromages Canadians.Tomme de Haut-Richeliu was created in response to a milk accident. In 2003, the Fromagerie received too much goat’s milk for the soft cheese that was being produced. In order to prevent the milk from spoiling, Fritz decided to make a firmer cheese that would have a longer shelf life. The result was this washed rind cheese with a thin layer of white mold covering its bright orange rind.The interior paste is ivory white in the middle, which graduates to a light beige toward the rind.  Its aroma is sweet and clean with notes of damp earth, reminiscent of a pasture right after a spring rain. The interior of the cheese has a slightly tangy flavor with savory notes in the finish and a smooth, silky texture. The rind has the flavor of wet stone.Like many goat milk cheeses, Tomme de Haut-Richeliu pairs very well with dry white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or un-oaked Chardonnay. It is delightful when served with dried fruit such as apricots or figs."
Tomme de Manigodine,Burgat Family Farm,France,Savoie,"5-6 ins diameter, 1.5 ins tall",2 ¾ lbs to 3 ½ lbs,www.reblochon-paccard.fr,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,,,"Located outside the town of Manigod in the Savoie region of France, the Burgat Family Farm is made up of two houses. One located at lower elevations near Manigod for the winter time and one higher into the mountains closer to the Summer pastures for their herd of dairy cows. It is here that Guillaume and Murielle raise their two boys Rémi and Andréa, and where Guillaume looks after the herd and Murielle makes cheese, following local tradition. The family produces the famous regional cheeses, Tomme Fermier and Reblochon as well as Tomme de Manigodine for the American market. “Manigodine” translates to “the woman of Manigod,” a name that pays homage to the tradition of women as the cheese makers in this part of France. It is basically a large format Reblochon that can be aged longer in order to meet U.S. regulations for raw milk cheeses. Raw milk Reblochon is not allowed into the United States since it is aged for less than 60 days. Tomme de Manigodine is made by hand by first heating the morning’s milk in a large cauldron in the cheesemaking room off of the Burgat’s kitchen. Starter culture and animal rennet are added to the heated milk, and the mixture is left to coagulate and ripen. After a few hours, Murielle takes a plastic scoop and begins breaking the curds up before using a cheese harp or cutter to divide the curds into smaller, more uniform sizes. She then gently ladles the curds into molds lined with cheesecloth. The curds are pressed by hand into the molds and left to drain overnight. Once drained and able to maintain their shape, the cheeses are salted and placed in the family’s small aging cave to mature a little before being shipped to Fromagerie Joseph Paccard for further aging. At Joseph Paccard, the cheeses are washed in a brine solution an then aged for up to 8 weeks before release for sale.Tomme de Manigodine has an orange rind with a thin layer of white mold on top. Its shiny paste is pale yellow in color with medium sized eyes toward the edges of the cheese. It has a rich, unctuous texture and a milky flavor with notes of nuts.  This cheese is best paired with bold red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon or bone dry sparkling wines. It is best used in the traditional dish of Tartiflette, where the cheese is cut around its hemisphere and placed on top of sliced potatoes and onions, and sautéed bacon bits."
Tomme de Nena,Kenny's Farmhouse Cheese / Standard Market,United States,Kentucky,8 in diameter x 8 in height,6 lbs,www.kennyscheese.com,Cow,Raw,Hard,Vegetable,Washed,Alpine-style,Flavor added to rind,"It may have a francophone name, but this is definitely an American original. Unlike tommes from across the pond, which are made from curds of skim milk leftover from buttermaking, Nena is made with the same double-crème curd that Kenny’s Farmhouse Cheese uses to make brie-style cheese. And instead of growing a moldy rind, wheels are washed in a range of local ales while aging for a totally different take on the French classic. Father-and-son team Kenny and Jared run Kenny’s Farmhouse Cheese on their farm in Austin, Kentucky, where a mixed-breed herd of Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss cows spends most of its time grazing outside on fresh pasture or munching on high-quality alfalfa hay. Kenny and Jared send a portion of their freshly pressed and salted wheels to the Countryside Cavemanaged by Standard Market near Chicago, where they’re washed in Revolution Brewery’s Eugene Porter several times a week. At two months, the wheels are dense and fudgy with a buttery taste, and at four to six months they firm up, becoming more earthy and malty with a blossoming nuttiness and notes of oatmeal. The rind develops a dark, rich mahogany color.Kenny’s cheesemakers suggest melting this firm beauty down into a Mornay sauce, or piling it into an “advanced-level” grilled cheese. Standard Market’s Porter-washed version pairs with beer, of course; try milk stouts, barley wines, and double IPAs. The same wheels shine alongside dry Alsatian wines, pinot noirs andSyrahs. For a spirit pairing, try a high-rye mashbill bourbon."
Tomme de Savoie,Various,France,Haute Savoie / Savoie,"10 ins diameter, 3 ins high",12 lb,,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,,"The name Tomme de Savoie makes reference to a region known as Savoie in the French Alps. The word tomme, which literally means ""wheel,"" or ""round,"" can be applied to as many as 100 different cheeses throughout France. However, the common factor is that the production of each results in a small/medium-sized mountain-style (ie. firm-textured, ideal for aging) cheese. Production of Tomme de Savoie uses semi-skimmed milk and originated as a by-product of several other traditional aged Savoie cheeses such as Beaufort. Since the aged cheeses require several months in order to mature to their peak, the cheesemakers started to produce Tomme de Savoie which typically reaches maturity within a matter of weeks, to help with cash flow. Tomme de Savoie also utilizes the semi-skimmed milk left over from the `make` procedure of the aged cheeses.Tomme de Savoie is covered with a suede-like, gray/brown rind that is frequently dotted with patches of yellow, red and white-colored mold. The interior paste of the cheese is ivory-colored, while the texture is pliable and has numerous ""eyes,"" or holes. Flavors are clean, milky and lactic, with slight citrus and mushroom notes overlaid with a pleasingly musty cellar aroma.Pair it with a white wine from the Savoie, such as a Chignin, an Apremont or Roussette."
Tomme Vaudoise,Fromagerie Moleson,Switzerland,Canton Vaud,"3-4” diameter, ¼” tall, ",4.5 oz,www.rolfbeeler.ch/e-index.php,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Fromagerie Moleson was founded in 1926 by master cheese-maker Odon Grossrieder in order to produce traditional Swiss cheeses such as Vacharin Fribourg and Gruyere. When M. Grossrieder’s sons took over the business in the mid-20th century, they expanded the operation considerably, producing a much wider range of cheese and dairy products. By the mid-1990s Fromagerie Moleson had also constructed their own aging caves and replaced the original facility with a new fromagerie that by 2006, was producing soft cheeses such as Tomme Vaudoise. Today, the fromagerie works in partnership with 50 dairy farmers who are dedicated to producing milk without feeding silage to their cattle. These farmers provide fresh milk to Fromagerie Moleson twice each day for the production of their cheeses. For the last thirty years, Rolf Beeler has had a small cheese booth located in Lucerne, Switzerland, that is dedicated to selling fine Swiss cheeses. Tomme Vaudoise is one of the few soft cheeses that Rolf Beeler has included in his collection. Mr. Beeler works solely with small-scale cheesemakers. Although some producers are still dedicated to making very traditional Swiss cheeses, Beeler also works with many new and innovative cheesemakers. These producers have emerged in the last fifteen years as a direct result of the easing of strict regulations surrounding Swiss cheese production. Beeler, in partnership with Caroline Hostettler, was among the first to introduce quality artisanal Swiss cheese to America. He is a highly acclaimed affineur (one who matures cheese) as well as Master Cheesemonger and has been dubbed by his peers as “Switzerland’s Pope of Cheese.” Tomme Vaudoise is a traditional, small format, raw cow’s milk cheese. Its highly aromatic, ivory colored, bloomy rind is marked with small indentations as a result of the cheeses aging on racks.Matured for 8 weeks, the cheese is intensly flavored with the flora of the valley where the milk is sourced.  It is fresh, grassy and aromatic with a gentle tang. The texture of Tomme Vaudoise is rich, oozy and yielding.This cheese is best paired with dry white wines, like ones made with the Chasselas (a Swiss grape). Tomme Vaudoise is also lovely when paired with white wines with a touch of spritz, dry roses or light reds such as Gamay.  Often, Tomme Vaudoise is highlighted in dishes. For example, it may be lightly pan fried and placed on top of a salad or alongside Rosti. It can also complete pasta dishes."

Torta del Casar,,Spain,Extremadura,2-3 in high,2 lbs,,Sheep,Raw,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"Produced in the Extremadura province of Spain, Torta Del Casar is a soft cheese with a dense, creamy texture and a rich, slightly funky flavor. The cheese is made from the rich raw milk of Merino and Entrefino sheep. Their milk yield is lowbut high in protein and fat. The milk is then coagulated using vegetable rennet from dried cardoon thistle stamens. This vegetable extract imbues the cheese with its subtle yet distinguishing earthiness as well as a slight bitterness. The curds are cut, placed in cylindrical molds, and pressed. The final cylinders weigh roughly two pounds and are about two to three inches high. The are then aged for at least two months. Torta del Casar`s rind is somewhat loose and undulating. With age,it can sometimes separate from the almost liquid paste within. The ivory paste is soft and spreadable. Accordingly, the traditional way to eat this cheese is with the rind cut off, so that the paste can be served by the spoonful or dipped into with a crusty piece of bread.Torta del Casaris rich, sour, and slightly nutty, diffused with floral notes and flavors of butter and artichokes. It has anoticeable earthiness and a bitter finish.Pair with crusty bread and slices of chorizo."
Torta Finca Pascualete,Finca Pascualete,Spain,Estremadura,Varies,Varies,www.fincapascualete.com/en/,Sheep,,Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"Made in Extramadura in western Spain, Torta Finca Pascualete is produced by the Figueroa family at their eponymous farm (or “finca”) or the same name.Cheeses have been made in the region for many centuries. Although Extramadura is known as one of the most rugged and poorest regions of Spain, it is also home to some of its most renowned foods, including traditional production of Torta style cheeses made from raw sheep’s milk and coagulated with rennet made from the stamens of the cardoon thistle.However, the history of cheesemaking at this particular farm has a more recent and very remarkable story.During World War II, Aline Griffith, a young woman from New York was sent on a mission to Madrid to infiltrate the aristocracy and gather intelligence for the CIA, which she successfully conducted for several years.After the end of the war, she stayed, marrying Luis de Figueroa, the Count of Romanones who was heir to extensive estates throughout Spain. One of these properties included Finca Pascualete. Upon visiting the run-down Finca, Romanones instantly fell in love with it and became determined to breathe new life into both the farm and the surrounding agricultural land.In 2002, the Countess, her son and grandson, embarked on an ambitious plan that would ultimately include starting a cheesemaking operation using milk from their own sheep grazed on the agricultural land belonging to the Finca. They purchased 1,000 Lacaune milking ewes from France, with a view to establishing a working sheep dairy and, for the next six years worked tirelessly to perfect the quality of the milk, before finally setting up a cheesemaking operation in the nearby town of Trujillo.Finca Pascualate is now run by the Countess’ grandson, Juan Figueroa. Maribel Santos is the head cheesemaker at the creamery where the sheep’s milk is transformed daily into a variety of cheeses. However, the Torta is their signature cheese.Production of such traditional torta style cheeses is unusually complex and temperamental. For the Finca Pascualete torta, unusually, Santos adds a very small amount of starter culture to the milk at the beginning of the cheesemaking process. This small step is a substantial departure from the traditional DOP (Name protected) versions made within the same region and results in more balanced flavors in the end product, with less of the sour or bitter notes frequently associated with this style of cheese.Cheeses are matured for at least two months before release, and this in itself is a very labor-intensive process since each day, every wheel is handled, cared for and moved about within the aging rooms to ensure controlled, even, aging and maturation.By the time they are ready for release, the cheeses have developed a rust-orange colored rind. This type of rind would normally be associated with the presence of a bacteria called Bacterium Linens (the same type of mold found in Taleggio for example), which would put it in the washed rind category of cheeses. However, in the case of the Torta, the molds and bacteria that contribute to the cheese’s character and development come from both the tiny amount of starter culture added at the beginning of the cheesemaking process as well as the natural microflora in the maturing rooms.The end result is a cheese with complex flavors of citrus, mushroom, minerals and wild grasses that change and evolve in the mouth.Although the interior texture can vary, the cheese is at its best when eaten at room temperature and the interior texture is smooth, cream-like in consistency and unctious. Suggested pairings include a lighter red wine such as a Rhone or Pinot Noir and Iberico ham."
Tortita_de_Barros,Cheese Factory Tierra de Barros,Spain,Badajoz,"2” tall, 3” diameter",1½ lbs,www.tortadebarros.com/en,GoatSheep,,Semi Soft,True Vegetable,Natural,,,"Located in the town of Villafranca de los Barros in the autonomous Extremadura region of Spain, Cheese Factory Tierra de Barros is in the heart of an area well known for its wines and cheeses. Its owners, Cristina Mangas Durán and Ernesto Méndez de la Cueva left successful careers in science and at the Denomination of Origin to start their own cheese factory in 1999. They had a vision of producing cheeses their own way. The result is a dairy that blends modern technology with artisanal cheese-making techniques. Made from either raw sheep or goat’s milk, Tortita de Barros is a cheese that is aged for 60 days. During that time, the cheese is wrapped in cloth, which is changed at regular intervals, and the cheese is flipped by hand to ensure even maturation. While some of the cheese-making process is automated, such as cutting the curds, the cheeses are ladled into their molds, pressed, flipped and salted all by hand. Additionally, the factory uses only raw milk from pasture-fed animals in its cheeses and thistle rennet harvested on the farm in the coagulation process.The resulting cheese has a thin, brittle butter-yellow rind that is wrapped in white lace. The interior is smooth and glossy white. There are small eyes unevenly spaced throughout the paste. Tortita de Barros’ aroma is herbaceous, a reflection of the wild herbs such as thyme and heather that grow on the farm. Its flavor is of fresh goat’s milk with a slightly bitter taste in the finish from the thistle rennet. With its vegetal qualities, this cheese will do very well with a leathery red wine such as certain Italian reds such as Chianti or Barolo. Tortita de Baros works well as a baked cheese when sprinkled with smoked paprika and marjoram. "
Torus,Vermont Creamery/Murray's Cheese,United States,Vermont,"3 in. diameter, 1 in. high",4 oz,www.murrayscheese.com/torus.html,Goat,,Soft,Microbial,Geotricum,,,"Founded in 1984 by Allison Hooper and Bob Reese, Vermont Creamery is located near Websterville, Vermont. Having spent time with a small-scale cheesemaker in Brittany during the 1970s, Allison was working as a state dairy lab technician in Vermont when she responded to a request from Bob Reese to produce some fresh chèvre for a state dinner. At the time, Bob was employed as marketing director for the Vermont Department of Agriculture. The chèvre was a hit and after some experimentation, Bob and Allison decided to go into production on a more formal basis, founding Vermont Creamery. Milk for cheese production comes from twenty-one family farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Quebec. Each farm has an average herd size of approximately 150 goats. Vermont Creamery makes a variety of fresh and young style cheeses and cultured dairy products, many of which are based on French recipes. They also make an outstanding cultured butter. Cheeses are made from either goat`s or cow`s milk. Torus is the product of collaboration between Vermont Creamery, where the cheese is made and initially matured, and Murray’s Cheese in New York, where affinage (maturation) is completed.The combination of Geotrichum mold on the rind and the donut-like shape means that the center of Torusmatures differently to a regular disc-shaped cheese. In terms of flavor, this results in Torus having a slightly more luscious mushroomy, buttery, and earthy flavor, with a mineral-y hint on the finish.Good wine pairings include sparkling wine, a fine Champagne, or a crisp Chenin Blanc."

Originally founded by two nuns from a religious order that focused on education and teaching, Sprout Creek was established with a view to continuing this mission.In addition to the cheesemaking component, Sprout Creek operates a fully functioning farm, a farmers` market, and residential courses. The courses are designed to give disadvantaged and inner city children a holistic taste of agricultural and rural life. The Creamery component at Sprout Creek sources milk from the farm`s own mixed herd of grass-fed Jersey, Guernsey, Milking Shorthorn and Brown Swiss cows. Cheesemaking methods are based on a traditional European model, and great attention is devoted to seasonality and animal welfare. Wheels aged over 60 days are made with raw milk. This raw milk wheel, with its yellow-hued paste from the farm`s grassfed milk surrounded by a rustic natural rind, is a great example of Sprout Creek`s cheesemaking philosophy.After five to seven months of aging, Toussaint becomes a robustly flavored cheese with a distinctive floral flavor, reminiscent of some of the mountain cheeses of Europe. These flavors become more complex and peppery with age. The texture is smooth and dense, with a thin natural rind.Pair a wedge of this Alpine-style cheese with a red ale or a glass of pinot noir."

The Knight’s Holstein cows graze outdoors seven months per year, and in the winter they eat haylage from the farm’s pesticide-free pastures. Silvery Moon Creamery was born in 2003 from a partnership between cheesemaker Jennifer Betancourt (who first learned the art of cheesemaking at the Squire Tarbox Inn on Westport Island, and later at Cornell University), and the Knight family. Today cheese production continues under the direction of Dorothee Grimm, who was born and raised in Germany and worked for years as a researcher in microbiology. After moving to Maine, Dorothee took cheesemaking classes from different local cheesemakers and made yogurt and cheese at home before applying for a position at Silvery Moon. “I still work in microbiology, pampering the good microbes and keeping the bad ones out,” Dorothee says. “But now, I can eat the results of my work at the end of the day.” This raw cow’s milk tomme-style cheese is aged for at least three months, during which the wheels are washed with Atlantic Brewing Co.’s Brother Adam’s Honey Ale (from Bar Harbor, Maine) three times per week. The cheese’s name is inspired by Town Hill spring, where Atlantic Brewing Co. sources the water used in brewing.This tomme exhibits a grainy, crumbly texture and a barnyardy smell that’s sweet and enticing.

Of this, 130 acres are allocated as pasture for their flock of Trade Lake sheep, while the remainder is devoted to wildlife habitat.Mary and Dave have worked tirelessly over the past decade to develop the Trade Lake breed of dairy sheep, that they consider particularly suited to the harsh climate of the region. In addition, the capacity of the Trade Lake Sheep to convert the abundant grasses of the area to milk is a great advantage.Cheeses are named after one of the several lakes surrounding the farm, Trade Lake Cedar being one example. After production, cheeses are transferred to an underground cave designed along the lines of a silo (silo construction was Dave`s former profession) where they are matured on cedar boards. In the case of Trade Lake Cedar, additional cedar boughs are placed on top of the cheeses to impart added flavor.During production, the curd is formed and pressed in a colander that gives Trade Lake Cedar its distinctive, flying saucer shape. Wheels are rustic in appearance, with a natural, brown-colored rind overlaid with patches of white and grey mold. The interior paste is ivory-white in color, becoming darker as the wheels mature.The paste is firm and punctuated with small holes or ""eyes,"" giving the cheese an open texture.Aromas and flavors are robust and can be assertive, varying with the seasons and the pasture the sheep have been grazing on.

Having had a successful tenure at the New Belgium Brewery as a process engineer, Ryan started to become interested in cheesemaking. Together with his friend Matt, Ryan began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After 2 years Will decided to pursue other interests and Matt and Ryan assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing Marketing, Sales and general business issues. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsular’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses all made from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a 275 cow dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Made in the style of some of the mountain cheeses of Europe, Trailhead is a firm-textured cheese, designed to have depth of flavor while being able to withstand the rigors of a backpacking trip. The cheese is made using a rennet based production and a cooked curd process. After pasteurization, the milk is cultured and rennet added to coagulate the milk and form it into curd. The curd is cut and stirred and then heated again to a higher temperature in order to expel additional moisture. At this stage the whey is drained off and the remaining curd is transferred into molds and pressed overnight. The following morning, the young cheeses are unmolded and placed into a brine solution in order to help with the formation of the rind. After removal from the brine, the cheeses are transferred to a maturing room where they remain for between 60-90 days before release. The texture of Trailhead is firm and smooth with an ivory-colored texture and a natural, brown-beige rind. Flavors are initially mild, becoming slightly more intense as the cheese remains in the mouth. There are sweet and pleasantly tangy notes, accompanied by an earthy, cellar-like aroma."

The Abbey produces two versions of the cheese; a traditional recipe based on Port Salut and a newer version of the same cheese but washed with walnut liqueur (pictured). The Abbey was founded in 1852 by monks who came from the Abbey of Port Hi Mayenne, bringing with them the recipe for Port Salut. As they established their new monastery and, driven by their mission to help the people of Double, the monks created a cheesemaking facility and purchased milk from neighboring farms. In addition they worked with the farmers to improve milk quality by enhancing breeding programs, sanitation procedures and working to produce better grazing. Using this milk, the monks produced Echourgnac until 1910 when production ceased for a few years. However, in 1923 the Abbey was taken over by nuns who have continued the cheesemaking tradition by producing Echourgnac and, in 1999, also introducing a variation of the cheese washed with walnut liqueur. The liqueur is sourced from nearby Périgord, an area famous for its nut groves and also home to a distillery, known for its production of nut liqueurs. This newer version of Echourgnac has proved so popular that in 2003 years the nuns decided to share the recipe with the monks at Timadeuc in order to meet demand (see separate Timanoix Cheese Library entry). Trappe Echourgnac comes in 8oz rounds and has a semi soft texture. The interior paste is pale straw in color while the exterior rind is a dark, rich brown – a result of the liqueur wash.

In 2007 they bought the dairy with their four daughters Anne, Theresa, Susan, and Annette, and they’ve since added a cheesemaking facility and a small retail store to sell the cheeses, goat milk soaps, maple syrups, and bakery items which are all made on the farm. When the Gervais family tasted their first batch of this Gouda-inspired goat’s milk cheese, they all kept saying, “it’s good… it’s very good.” “Our mom was working in the back room,” remembers cheesemaker Anne Doe, “and being French, she said ‘c’est très bon!’” After playing around with the wording, and finding out that “bonne” was the feminine version of “bon,” they decided to name the cheese Très Bonne after the girls who produced it. Young wheels of the cheese are covered in a yellow cheese wax coating from the Netherlands, which is applied two coats per side over a four-day period. They’re then left to age for a minimum of eight weeks.Sweet smelling and mild with grassy notes, this cheese is smooth and pliable in texture. Taste is pleasant and milky on the palate with a salty forwardness and a long, mild finish. Notes of yogurt and coconut can be detected.Pair it with a sparkling cider, a pale ale or fresh fruits."

Juan Carlos learned cheesemaking with the monks of Conbreces who are famous for their cheesemaking abilities. Today, Juan and Maria are assisted by one employee along with their 19 year-old son, who helps out during holidays.Soft cheeses made from mixed milk are unusual in Spain. Tres Leches (which means “three milks”) is produced using a blend of cow, sheep and goat’s milk and formed into a small, soft dome that looks like a snowball. It has a white bloomy rind that encases a mild-flavored paste.Crisp white wines tend to taste best with Tres Leches.

Supposedly, the idea to collaborate came to the friends one night after a beer-fueled conversation about the evolving cheese industry in America—and Creamery 333 was born. This little goat’s milk round is inspired by the traditional cheeses of the Loire Valley in the Creamery 333 founders’ homeland. With its diminutive stature and wrinkly rind, Tricycle particularly recalls Crottin de Chavignol. That brainy white surface develops over 10 days of aging, thanks to a yeast called Geotrichum that’s added to milk early in the cheesemaking process.Paste is chalky and dense, smelling sweet with hints of goat, barn and hay. We love how the tang and slight acidity of that thick inner core is balanced by the rind, which offers a bready, earthy dimension.Pair it with a baguette and some sauvignon blanc."

Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today. To make the cheese, pasteurized cow`s milk plus added cream is poured into `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.) With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. The cheeses are unmolded and brined, then placed on racks to dry before they’re transferred to the aging rooms where they will spend 10-14 days before release. The cheeses are turned once during this time to promote mold growth. Another version of this cheese is also produced with black truffles in the paste: Triple Crème Brie with Truffles.The interior paste of the Triple Creme is dense, soft and smooth with occasional small holes.

Birgit, who is originally from Germany, has a background in Food Science and Robert was the Fermentation Manager at the brewery. In 2000, after some experimental cheesemaking at home, Birgit enlisted the help of her father, Franz, a master cheesemaker from Germany. Today, MouCo Cheese Company produces four types of soft cheese: MouCo Camembert, ColoRouge, Ashley and Truffello. Pasteurized milk, predominantly from Holstein cows, is sourced from Morning Fresh Dairy, located just outside Fort Collins. For production of Truffello, the milk is heated and the cultures and rennet added. After coagulation, small slivers of imported black truffle are added to the curd which is carefully ladled into molds to preserve as much moisture as possible. The young cheeses are then allowed to drain for a few hours, before being unmolded and salted which helps to kick-start the development of the white bloomy rind. They are then transferred to racks and dried slightly before being moved to the maturing cave. After a period of about two weeks the cheeses are ready to be released. The texture of Truffello is soft, creamy and yielding. The exterior rind is white and bloomy and the interior paste ivory white and studded with black truffle. The flavors of Truffello are clean, rich and smooth with distinctly aromatic truffle notes and flavors of truffles and cream. With age, the texture becomes luscious and viscous whilst the flavors deepen, becoming more earthy."

Founder Johann Englert came across Al Ducci`s Groceria in Manchester, Vermont during a visit, and when she tasted their mozzarella, it transported her back to her time in Italy during college. Johann immediately bought 20 pieces of the mozzarella since she knew she couldn’t get anything that good in Boston, where she lived. After returning home, she contacted the Al Ducci’s and spoke to the owner’s son, Mike Scheps, who happened to be the cheesemaker and asked him if he could supply her in Boston with the curd to make their own mozzarella. With an answer of yes, the agreement was in place and Maplebrook Farm was born. Today Maplebrook Farm is located in Bennington, Vermont, and it is a major producer of artisanal cheese on the east coast. The Farm sources its rBGH free milk from small family farms throughout Vermont to make their line of mostly Italian cheeses. Maplebrook Farm’s Burrata is made using the traditional techniques of a stretched curd cheese, very similar to Mozzarella, pulled into a sheet. The sheet of cheese then has fresh cream and stracciatelli (shreds of Mozzarella curds) placed in the center. In this variety, the shreds and cream are mixed with earthy black truffles. The sheet of stretched curd is then wrapped around the filling and pinched off at the top. The result is a ball of cheese that, when cut, spills its creamy contents onto the plate.Truffle smell is pungent on the nose but subtler on the palate, filling the mouth with rich, oaky, earthy flavors. Inside texture is cloudlike and very creamy with a touch of stringiness and flakes of truffle speckled throughout, while outside is thin and firm. Milk flavor is delicate and sophisticated.This would be great as a topping on pizza alongside thinly sliced skirt steak and arugula. For drink pairings, try it with a merlot."

Truffle Tremor,Cypress Grove Chevre  ,United States,California,"7 ins diameter, 3-4 ins high",3 lbs, www.cypressgrovechevre.com,Goat,,Semi Soft,Vegetable,FlavoredMold Ripened,,,"Cypress Grove Chevre is located in Humboldt County in the temperate Pacific Northwest coastal region of California. The origins of the business began during the 1970’s when the company’s founder, Mary Keehn, became interested in Alpine dairy goats while searching for a healthy source of milk for her young daughters. This resulted in the acquisition of two goats and from this small start, she quickly developed a passionate interest in breeding high quality Alpine goats. Within a few years, the size of Mary’s herd increased significantly and, finding herself with excess goat milk, she started experimenting with cheesemaking. By 1983 and with the beginnings of a regular customer base, she officially founded Cypress Grove Chevre. At the time, commercial goat cheese production was virtually unheard of in the US and Mary, along with a handful of other goat cheesemakers, was one of the first to spearhead the movement. As Cypress Grove grew, the challenges of managing the goats in addition to the cheesemaking became insurmountable. Therefore, the decision was made to sell the goats to a number of local farms with the arrangement to buy back the milk. Each dairy still operates under an incentive program, ensuring that consistently high quality milk is supplied back to Cypress Grove for cheesemaking. This arrangement allowed Mary to fully focus on the cheesemaking and to take the company forward. Until the early 1990’s Cypress Grove focused on fresher styles of goat’s milk cheeses. However, the successful creation of Humboldt Fog in 1992, helped pave the way for several other American Originals. As the company grew and expanded, Mary was approached with many acquisition offers. However, none of the proposals seemed an appropriate fit until August 2010 when she received a proposal from Emmi, a Swiss company, majority-owned by a cooperative of small farmers and dairy operators. Emmi committed to keep the company’s employees and headquarters in Humboldt County as well as maintaining Cypress Grove’s long-standing commitments with the community, environment and milk suppliers. Created in 2007, Truffle Tremor is a mold ripened cheese that was inspired by an effort to combine the earthy flavors of goat cheese and truffles. For production of Truffle Tremor, milk is pasteurized in a vat where cultures and coagulants are added and held for the acid ripening process. The mixture is then moved to a curd press where the whey is drained. The curd is then mixed with salt, truffles, and mold cultures before being hand-packed into cheese forms. The cheeses spend eight days in primary ripening where they are turned daily and then “cold stabilized” for several more days before being wrapped and sent to market.Truffle Tremor has a dense, champagne-white interior studded with small, delicate pieces of black truffle.  The rich, earthy notes of the truffle combine with the lactic cream-like notes of the milk resulting in an elegant balance of flavors that are pronounced without being overly assertive. As the cheese matures, the paste becomes softer just under the rind, resulting in a more herbaceous flavor."
Trufflestack ,Mt Townsend Creamery,United States,Washington,"3 ins diameter, 2 ins high",6 oz,www.mttownsendcreamery.com,Cow,,Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,,"Founded in 2005 by Matt Day and Ryan Trail, Mt Townsend Creamery is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Port Townsend, WA. Having had a successful tenure at the New Belgium Brewery as a process engineer, Ryan started to become interested in cheesemaking. Together with his friend Matt, Ryan began experimenting with in his kitchen and soon thereafter, the two enrolled for a cheesemaking class at Washington State University. From there, they hooked up with fellow co-founder Will O’Connell who had been trying to establish a farmstead creamery, and the three joined together to get Mt Townsend Creamery up and running. After 2 years Will decided to pursue other interests and Matt and Ryan assumed full management of the creamery with Ryan focused on cheese production and creamery infrastructure and Matt managing Marketing, Sales and general business issues. Inspired by the Olympic Peninsular’s rich dairy history, Mt Townsend produces a variety of cheeses all made from Brown Swiss and Holstein cow’s milk. Mt Townsend has partnered with Maple View Farm, a 275 cow dairy located 30 miles from the creamery. The dairy delivers milk directly to the creamery and Mt Townsend has a close working relationship with the farm. Trufflestack is produced using a partial lactic coagulation process. After pasteurization, the milk is cultured and allowed to acidify naturally before rennet is added. After coagulation, the curd is cut and truffle salt is mixed in. The curd is carefully transferred to the cheese molds and allowed to drain naturally. After unmolding, the young cheeses are transferred to a drying room where they’re left overnight. They are then moved to a ripening room where they will remain for about eight days, at which point the cheeses are wrapped and aged for a further two weeks before release. The texture of Trufflestack is soft and dense, becoming more fluid just under the rind as it ages. Flavors are light and tangy, with rich hints of truffle, salt, earth, mushrooms and citrus."
Tête de Moine,Bellelay Abbey,Switzerland,Swiss Jura,"4 ins high,  3 ins diameter",2 lbs,www.tetedemoine.ch,Cow,,Firm,Animal,Washed,,,"Originally created by the monks of Bellelay Abbey in the Bernese Jura mountains, the recipe for Tête de Moine was passed on to local farmers whose descendents still produce the cheese today. Production has spread to many small dairies throughout the area of the Bernese Jura.Traditionally Tête de Moine was only made from summer milk and sold from when the first leaves of autumn began to fall until March. Today it is made and sold throughout the year.Originally called Bellelay, after the abbey, the cheese was renamed Tête de Moine after the French Revolution. Tête de Moine means ""monks head"" and some say the name derives from the tax levied by the abbey, whereby the farmers would provide one cheese for each monk during the season. Others believe it refers to the tonsured appearance of the cheese when it is served in the traditional way - with the top sliced off and the rind cut away to a depth of 1 inch all round.Tête de Moine is produced in nine village dairies, using modern procedures but traditional methods for cheese production.Cow`s milk for production is delivered to the dairy twice a day and fodder for the milk cows has to come from the geographical AOC region. Silage may not be used at any time of the year, due to its negative impact on the cheese quality.During spring, summer and autumn, the dairy cows graze in the meadows. In winter they are primarily fed on hay. Since the milk produced should be as natural as possible, the use of animal meal and hormones, genetically modified organisms, or products of any kind are strictly prohibited.After production, cheeses from the previous day are immersed in a brine bath for at least 12 hours. By absorbing salt, the cheeses expel more water, the rind starts forming and the maturing period begins.The cheese is shaped like a short cylinder. Young cheeses which, according to AOC rules have to be matured at a temperature of about 13-14°C within a specified region are placed onto pine boards to mature for at least 75 days in a humid cheese cellar (about 90% humidity). During that time they have to be cared for and turned regularly.The cheeses are brushed with a mixture of a brine and bacteria culture so that they form a washed rind, a process that promotes maturing from the exterior to the interior of the cheese. No colors or chemical surface treating agents are allowed.Tête de Moine has a firm, straw-yellow paste and a spicy, fruity flavor and aroma.Tête de Moine is often shaved using a special cutter called a girolle. Shaving the cheeses releases all the aroma and flavors. Sometimes it is eaten with pepper and powdered cumin. Of course, the cheese can be enjoyed when sliced thinly on the cheese board and can also be shaved over salads and other dishes as a garnish."

To create the design, Brown tapped artist Mike Perry, best known for his graphic title sequences for the Comedy Central show Broad City. It was a local collaboration for the artist—based in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights—and the nearby cheese cave, where affineurs experiment with maturation methods and as diverse array of washes in a former layering tunnel under the Nassau Brewery building. (The tunnels here stay at about 50 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, the perfect climate for ripening cheese.) The copper cauldron doubling as a bath in the illustration is a nod to the traditional Alpine cheesemaking practices respected at Spring Brook Farm in Reading, Vermont, where Tubby is produced from raw cow’s milk. When young, the 30-pound wheels are sent to the caves in Brooklyn, where they’re washed in brine as they age for a year.The resulting tawny wheels have a smooth paste studded with crystals, yielding flavors of buttermilk and piña colada.Pair it with a brown ale, a vin jaune, or a glass of dry sherry."
Tulare Cannonball,Bravo Farms,United States,California,6 ins diameter,4 lbs,www.bravofarms.com,Cow,,Firm,Vegetable,Plasticoat,,,"Bravo Farms began as a small dairy in 1979 in the town of Visalia, California, located in Tulare County in central California. Owners Bill and Pat Boersma ran the dairy for several years before deciding to convert to a farmstead cheesemaking operation in 1995. The Boersma’s were the first farmstead cheese makers in the San Joaquin Valley and became known for their farmhouse white cheddar. Shortly after venturing into cheesemaking, they met Jonathan Van Ryn, a graduate of Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where he studied animal husbandry and cheese making. Van Ryn was building a cheese making facility near by in Traver, when the Boersmas approached the Van Ryn family with proposal of renting space in the facility. The partnership resulted in Jonathan becoming the cheese maker for Bravo Farms, while the Boersmas decreased their cow herd, from 800 cows to about 80 milking cows in order to focus on premium quality milk for cheesemaking. Appropriately, most of the surplus cows were sold to Jonathan’s father, who has a dairy in Arizona. Today, milk for cheesemaking is supplemented with milk from Jonathan’s Uncle’s farm which still allows them to have control over milk quality while being able to expand production. Tulare Cannonball cheese is Bravo’s version of a 500- year old Edam recipe. Produced from raw whole milk cow’s milk, the cheese is molded in a traditional ball shape and aged for 6 months before being sold. The texture is rich and smooth. Flavors are mild and yet have a slight ‘spicy’ tang and pleasant saltiness."
Tulum (Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Coop),Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Coop,United States,Wisconsin,,40 lbs,www.sheepmilk.biz,CowSheep,,Firm,Vegetable,Waxed,,,"When the Wisconsin Sheep Dairy Cooperative was formed in the 1990s, sheep’s milk cheesemaking in America was a young and struggling industry in which small startups often fizzled out. When the cheese plant Montchevre in WI decided to start using sheep`s milk, they decided to do it only if they could work with a single source that handled all of the licensing, inspections, inventory and payment. So local sheep farmers responded by forming the WSDC to organize sheep dairying into a more reliable, standardized profession. When the co-op ended up with a surplus of milk, members decided to start making their own cheese.Milk is sourced from mostly East Friesian and Laucane Breed ewes of member farmers. During spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and are fed a limited amount of natural grain while being milked.Tulum, which is inspired by the strong Turkish cheese by the same name, is made with a mixture of cow and sheep’s milk and is aged for 8-9 months. Wet to the touch but not greasy, it has a soft and pillowy yet slightly crumbly texture.With an extremely sharp and tangy flavor, it is sure to please die-hard fans of sheep’s milk cheeses, aged fetas, or extra sharp cheddars (such as Hook’s 10 Year).Pair it with a Champagne, an IPA or an Amber Ale.

The goats browse the pastures surrounding the dairy year round, eating shrubs, grass, and alfalfa. Since the geology in this region reflects its volcanic past, the soil is particularly rich in minerals, which is reflected in the flavor of the milk and Juniper Grove`s cheeses.An attorney by training, later in life Pierre decided to pursue his passion for cheese. Having acquired the farm, he worked in Normandy by apprenticing with Camembert cheesemaker, François Durand, and also earned a degree at the National Dairy School in Poligny before returning to the United States in 1987.Pierre makes a range of farmstead goat cheeses largely inspired by French recipes, and uses European methods.The inspiration for Tumalo Tomme was Tomme de Savoie, an aged mountain cheese from eastern France. The word ""tomme"" or ""tome"" in French (""tomas"" in Italian) simply means ""round."" It can therefore be used to describe either a cow`s, sheep`s or goat`s milk cheese.Although Tomme de Savoie is a cow`s milk cheese, Kolisch`s version is made from raw goat`s milk. Twice a day he milks the 95 goats on his farm, combining the evening and morning milk. Only about 45, 4lb. wheels of Tumalo Tomme are produced each week.After production, cheeses are aged on pine boards in the cellar.The paste is firm, yet creamy and smooth. Flavors include hints of hay and salt. While summer cheeses are fruitier and more flowery, winter cheeses are richer and more ""meaty.""Tumalo Tomme pairs well with light-bodied white wines such as Chenin Blanc, Alsacian Pinot Blanc and Vouvray."

Also: cheese-fueled biking is a nice way to burn those calories. It was that very attitude that drew the former Pennsylvanian to a 100-year-old dairy farm in Goshen, which he purchased and rebuilt alongside his wife, Barbara. The duo now make cheese with respect for the local terroir and environment, using raw farmstead milk from Holstein cows in an energy-efficient operation completely fueled by solar power. Like several other 5 Spoke cheeses, Tumbleweed is simultaneously cheddar-esque and Cantal-esque—but in this case, a full year of aging takes flavor to the next level, its paste yielding visible faultlines and a crumbly texture. Formed into smaller blocks of 10 lbs, wedges are sold with a mottled rind intact, adding an earthy dimension to flavor.Aromas are heady: butterscotch, roses and basement towards the exterior, berries and fruit in the paste. Mouth-coating on the palate, flavors rush in quickly with echoes of roasted onion tart, and finish slowly with lingering hints of chocolate cake.Pair it with a bold Tempranillo, or serve alongside honey with a touch of balsamic vinegar—plus fresh figs, when available."

Amy and Stephen Hueffed first started dreaming of a lifestyle change during an inspiring trip through Northern California, where they sampled local cheeses and pondered one day producing their own. Fourteen years later in 2005, after taking Washington State University cheesemaking classes in Pullman and Skagit Valley, Amy and Stephen finally settled onto their farm with a flock of 60 dairy ewes. Since then Willapa Hills, now home to three generations of the Hueffed family, has continuously revised and expanded its activities and product line. The diverse mix of sheep’s milk, cow’s milk and mixed-milk cheeses is produced with a long-term commitment to sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. For example, the farm has switched over to growing all of its own hay, lowering costs of overall feed and ensuring that hay is natural and free of pesticides and commercial fertilizers. Two-Faced Blue, named for its combination of sheep and cow’s milks, was one of Willapa Hills’ first cheeses. After production, wheels are pierced at an age of about 4 days in order to allow air into the cheese and the development of the subtle blue veins that contribute to the maturing process and flavor of the cheese. Two Faced Blue is matured for between 3-4 months. The interior of the cheese is ivory colored with a fairly open texture that is smooth and moist.The subtly yellow paste of Two-Faced Blue cheese exhibits blue veins throughout, and while smell is initially strong, at first bite there’s nothing but a creamy, melt-in-the-mouth flavor. After a second a delayed rush of salt floods the tongue, and mineraly flavors fade into a pleasant, lingering sweetness. Unlike many other blues, there is no big spicy hit and this allows the more delicate flavors (earth, cellar and mushrooms) to present themselves.Pair Two-Faced blue with a Port or a Madeira."

After production, firm cow`s milk cheeses are soaked in the grape must of cabernet, merlot, and rabesco grapes. At approximately three weeks of age, the wheels are then soaked in a brandy made from the residue of the black grapes after they`ve been pressed.This unusual production process results in a cheese that has a delicate flavor and a fragrant aroma. Itspaste is firm and moist, with a slightly crumbly texture.

Crooked Face Creamery’s fresh, whole milk Up North ricottas are made using Maine Jersey cow milk before being smoked with local, organic applewood. Rowbottom named the cheese for the feeling she gets when she eats it. “The smell reminds me of sitting around a campfire up at Moosehead lake,” she says, “and the happiness I felt in those moments.”This beautifully-packaged ricotta exudes definite aromas of smoke, which become more subtle on the palate alongside the cheese’s creamy notes and slight hint of salt. Texture is light and fluffy—the perfect consistency for dipping or spreading. Slather this ricotta atop a Castleton cracker and drizzle with olive oil and salt or a dash of pepper jelly.

Today it is made by a small number of local artisanal cheesemakers, most of whom have a difficult time justifying the effort that goes into making a genuine Vacherin Fribourgeois - hence it has become something of an endangered species.Milk comes from the Fribourgeois breed of cows, which is the local name for Holsteins.The leading production area for Vacherin is the region between the towns of Bulle (Canton Vaud) and Fribourg (Canton Fribourg in western-central Switzerland. However, it is also made in other parts of western Switzerland, right up to the Jura Mountains on the border with France.Production takes place in small artisanal dairies and one of the best versions comes from the producers of the Vacherin Fribourgeois co-op in Bulle, and is matured by Rolf Beeler.Cheeses are pressed and uncooked and have a washed rind that is cured for between three and four months. It is a painstaking and ancient method, with repeated washings and turnings.Vacherin Fribourgeois has a thick, brown-gray-red, undulating wavy rind, with an underlying cross-hatch pattern and tinges of yellow, grey or pink. The paste is light yellow and very smooth, often with eyes and/or some slits.Firm, yet relatively soft compared with other typical Swiss cheeses,such as Guyère, it has a distinctive aroma reminiscent of a pleasant sourness.

They are turned and rubbed with a cloth soaked in brine, which results in each cheese developing a distinctive and pleasing spruce aroma.Vacherin Mont d`Or is presented in it`s wooden box, in which it continues to ripen. The pleasant scent of the spruce band in which it is encased permeates the cheese and also helps maintain its shape. It should not be removed, rather it is easier to cut a ""lid"" in the top of the cheese and spoon out its liquidy center. It can also be spread on bread or potatoes.The surface of the cheese is moist and golden-red in color, sometimes with imprints of the cloth. The yellow paste is creamy and soft."

Valdeon is one of a number of similar type cheeses from the valley of Valdeon, in the northwestern section of the province of Leon, on the edge of the Picos de Europa mountains.Cave aged for a minumum of two months and sometimes as much as four, it is made to virtually the same recipe as Cabrales, but with a few key differences. The maturing caves in this area are less humid than those in the Cabrales region, which translates as less mold development in the cheeses. Also, the most traditional Valdeon is still produced wrapped in ""plageru"" (sycamore) leaves, which allow certain bacteria to penetrate the cheese and add complexity. Traditional Valdeon can also be made with small amounts of goat`s milk.Valdeon is a fairly assertive blue cheese, without being harsh. The paste is semi firm and it delivers a complex array of flavors, with an underlying sweet, almost caramel-like note. This complexity is multiplied by the inclusion of goat`s milk, which has gained popularity in recent years.The paste is cream-colored ivory, with punctuated holes and striations of greyish green mold.Valdeon pairs well with Gruner Veltliner, Reisling, or a sweeter dessert wine such as Sauternes or Muscat."

This young goat`s milk cheese is distinguished by its truncated pyramid form, and its layer of ash underlying its surface`s bloomy white rind. According to local legend, Valençay was originally shaped like the perfect pyramid. That is, until Napoleon returned from his disastrous military campaign in Egypt. Stopping at the castle of Valençay and seeing the cheese that reminded him of the Egyptian pyramids, Napoleon supposedly sliced off the top with his sword in a rage. Production of Valençay involves the drained curd being placed in a mold before being removed and coated with salted charcoal ashes. Cheeses are then placed in a chilled drying room at 80 percent humidity to encourage the growth of the white Penicillium candidum mold.The texture of Valençay is smooth and dense with a mild, lemony, and altogether clean, bright flavor.It pairs very well with crisp, dry white wines such as sauvignon blanc."

It hails from Oregon`s Face Rock Creamery, which is set in one of the oldest cheesemaking areas on the West Coast. As early as the 1880s, cheese was being made in the many dairy farms in the Coquille Valley to the east of the town, and in 1936 the Bandon Cheese Factory was founded. The son of the factory’s founder, Brad Sinko, took over and ran it until 2003 when it was bought out by a larger competitor. Sinko then spent 10 years as the head cheesemaker Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle and New York. While Sinko was making cheddars in Seattle, the Bandon Cheese Factory was abandoned and torn down by the company that had purchased it. Locals in the town were disappointed to see a gravel pit where the Bandon Cheese Factory once stood. Working alongside the community, some local developers decided to rebuild a structure that would host not only a 9,000 sq. foot creamery, but also a 2,000 sq. foot well retail space and cafe. Today cheese is being made in Bandon once again in this location, and Brad Sinko has returned as head cheesemaker. The name ‘Face Rock’ refers to a local monolithic formation on the Oregon coast that resembles a face looking up at the sky. Face Rock sources its milk from The Scolari Family Dairy in Coquille, only 15 miles away. The farm has been owned by the same family since the early 1930s, and today has a herd of Holstein and Brown Swiss cows. Vampire Slayer is a garlic-infused cheddar that’s formed into 40-pound blocks and aged for at least four months in a plastic coating.This cheddar is salty and savory with low acidity. Its lingering allium notes are layered, reminiscent of raw garlic, roasted garlic and garlic chives all at once.Vampire Slayer lends itself well to cooking, adding an extra layer of flavorto sandwiches, pasta or a gratin.

Located in Pescadero, California, Harley Farms is a restored dairy farm that dates back to 1910. Owned and run by Dee Harley, a native of Britain, this is the only remaining dairy in San Mateo County, a once thriving dairy region. Having originally started with six pet goats, Harley Farms is now home to over 200 American Alpine goats. The milk is transformed into farmstead cheeses daily.  For production of this fresh chèvre, the milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature in order to retain as much of its character as possible. The curd is also handled very gently to preserve the high moisture and delicate texture of the cheese. The fresh cheese is allowed to drain for 12-16 hours before being formed into discs and decorated with the edible flowers. Head cheesemaker Salud Zavala picks flowers for the cheese from the farm’s garden, which she arranges in the bottom of muffin tins (for small size versions) or in custom-made molds (for larger versions). A layer of fresh cheese is placed over the petals, sprinkled with a layer of sunflower seeds and basil, then covered with another layer of fresh cheese. The flavors of Van Goat are fresh, milky and sweet with slight vegetal notes, a hint of citrus and a slight crunchiness from the sunflower seeds.

Living in Waco, Texas in the traditional agricultural and crafts community Homestead Heritage, Rebeccah was looking for a way to use some extra spring milk that the community’s Brown Swiss cows had been producing. Using books and experimentation, she gradually began producing dairy products, hard and soft cheeses, eventually teaching her craft to others. In May of 2005, Rebeccah’s cousin Marc Kuehl visited the community and decided to stay and make cheese with her. Together, the pair founded Brazos Valley Cheese. Since then the company has continuously grown—from making two 36-gallon batches per week to using a 200-gallon vat, to purchasing a 400-gallon vat that was custom made in the Netherlands and building an underground aging cave. Milk is sourced from three local Brazos Valley dairies, where Jersey and Brown Swiss cows graze freely outside. All of the company’s cheeses are raw milk cheeses.  One day after producing wheels of a different cow’s milk cheese, Brazos Valley cheesemakers went home and accidentally forgot to turn off the heat. Knowing that temperature plays a huge role in the initial development of a cheese, the team predicted that this batch would turn out quite differently. In case it would be edible after aging, the cheesemakers decided to do an experiment, rubbing the outside of the wheels with vanilla, sorghum and cinnamon during the first two weeks of aging. The experiment was a success, and the accidental recipe nowhas a permanent slotin the Brazos Valley lineup. Smelling like red hots or cinnamon gum with notes of mint, this cheese has a curiously blank flavor at first that builds yielding notes of earth, pine and cinnamon, with headier aromas towards the rind.Co-owner Marc Kuehl suggests using Van Sormon in a grilled cheese sandwich or enjoying it solo."

Milk for production is sourced from nearby organic farmers, who raise local breed Muriciano-Granadina goats. Production of cheese in the creamery can be divided into two main categories: organic, raw milk cheeses that are produced for the local market, and conventional, pasteurized cheeses that are produced for the U.S. export market (the supply of organic goat’s milk in the region is limited, and the exported cheese must be pasteurized to comply with FDA requirements). To produce these goat’s milk cheeses, Casado adds lactic acid bacterial cultures along with a bit of yogurt to milk at 82 degrees, and after waiting about one hour for the milk to reach a pH of 4.5, adds rennet. During this time salt is also added to the milk, which is a rather unique practice (the addition of salt before cutting the curd means that a large portion of it will lost along with the whey, but Casado believes that this step helps to develop just the right amount of saltiness). The curd is left to form overnight, and is put in draining bags the following day. Bags are left for a further 24 hours, then pressed to expel whey. When ready, the cheese is placed in a homogenizer that was specially designed by Casado to create a smooth, uniform consistency, to add desired flavors such as garlic or quince, and to form the cheese into log or rectangular shapes. At this point, some of the fresh cheeses are rolled in herbs such as black pepper, red pepper, or green chilies and then sent to the cooler, ready to be sold. Others are placed in a brine that’s been inoculated with Penicillium candidum spores, then rolled in oak ash and placed in a drying room, where a white bloomy rind begins to develop. After 8-12 days the fuzzy logs are moved into a cooler with a lower temperature, where the rind continues to develop more slowly for up to three weeks more.The high butterfat content of the milk from Muriciano-Granadina goats gives Veigadarte cheeses a soft, fluffy, cheesecakey texture. Flavor is creamy and fresh with notes of citrus and pepper. The ash-covered, mold-ripened version is slightly more pungent and mushroomy, displaying a smoother, beige-colored paste close to the outside and a chalkier, white texture in its center.Pair Veigadarte cheeses with Champagne or with a Reisling."

When the cheese plant Montchevrein WI decided to start using sheep`s milk, they decided to do it only if they could work with a single source that handled all of the licensing, inspections, inventory and payment. So local sheep farmers responded by forming the WSDC to organize sheep dairying into a more reliable, standardized profession. When the co-op ended up with a surplus of milk, members decided to start making their own cheese.Milk is sourced from mostly East Friesian and Laucane Breed ewes of member farmers. During spring and summer, the sheep graze freely on pasture and are fed a limited amount of natural grain while being milked.Veneto is a 100% sheep’s milk Asagio-style cheese that’s wrapped in black wax and aged for twelve months.

In order to save the business, Jim, Cindy and Sherry made the decision to reduce the number of cows they owned from 70 to 20 and transition into raw farmstead cheese production.Fortunately they met cheesemaker Maria Trumper, whose goal it was to make a raw milk cheese. Together they converted a 1910 barn on the property and began cheese production with 150lbs. per week, using an old soup kettle as a cheese vat..Ayrshire milk is particularly well suited to cheese making. In terms of fat and protein, it is not as high as Jersey or Guernsey, but not as low as Holstein. The way in which the fats and proteins break down are a perfect platform for the development of an excellent cheese.They have named the cheese Vermont Ayr in deference to both the clean air enveloping the farm, and to the cows. Although styled after an Alpine cheese, it is quite reminiscent of a cheddar. Cheeses are aged in climate controlled conditions on the farm.Vermont Ayr is a beautifully balanced, rich cheese, with complex flavors and great length.Wheels are aged for a minimum of three months although some are aged to about seven months. The rind is of stone-colored grey mold, and relatively thin. Flavors are toasty and nutty, with a smooth buttery finish."

Parish Hill’s cheeses are inspired by the traditional cheeses of Italy. They’re handmade in small batches using raw milk, which is produced at the Elm Lea Farm at the Putney School. The farm is just five minutes down the road from the cheese house, and its milking herd grazes on fresh pasture from June to October. Parish Hill cheese production happens from May to November in order to take advantage of the pastures that give a highly aromatic quality to the milk, resulting in complex and subtle flavor variations. Milk for cheesemaking is ripened using homegrown cheese cultures, which are produced by inoculating the farm’s raw milk with pure bacterial cultures and then propagating them continuously. Traditional calf rennet is sourced from Europe and Quebec, and sea salt is sourced from the Maine Sea Salt Company in Marshfield. Vermont Herdsman is produced in the style of traditional Italian Asiago Grasso di Monte and aged for nine months. During aging, wheels are periodically scrubbed with a salt brine, developing a straw-colored, edible rind.Texture is toothsome and slightly crumbly with a spattering of holes and occasional amino crystals throughout. Initial flavor is sweet and salty with notes of caramel, giving way to acidity with a slight tang and finishing with a funky, peppery aftertaste. Hints of pineapple and hazelnuts can be detected.Pair it with a Sangiovese or with a brown ale."

Lisa first milked cows as an aspiring veterinarian, then spent eight years working on other people’s farms before buying an old farmhouse in Chester, Vermont. Soon after, she was milking two dozen Jersey Cows and selling the raw milk to neighbors and to other Vermont cheesemakers. Today Lisa has a full scale pasteurizing and bottling line, and is selling milk, veal, eggs and cheese on-site as well as in markets as far away as New York City. Quark is a soft, fresh skimmed milk cheese that is traditional in parts of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. This version is made on-site in Chester, Vermont in small batches from Lisa’s skimmed, pasteurized Jersey Cow’s milk. Each eight-ounce container is packaged by hand.Vermont Quark resembles ricotta in appearance, but it’s thicker and firmer in texture. Smell is slightly tangy and sour, reminiscent of butter and buttercream frosting. Flavor exhibits a tart, tangy acidity that makes us think of lemon meringue pie. When tanginess fades, buttery flavors linger.We’d eat this with granola and honey on peaches in the morning, or spread over a bagel. Lisa also suggests using her quark to make a “crazy good cheesecake.”"

Made in the springtime, when the sheep have been grazing on pastures and fields, Verano is a sheep’s milk cheese that’s available from August to April.Vermont Shepherd is the creation of the Major and Ielpi family, who own and run one Vermont’s oldest sheep farms, also called Vermont Shepherd (formerly Major Farm). Having bought the farm from his parents, David Major was among the first small-scale cheesemakers in the United States to begin producing sheep`s milk cheese in the 1990s.Because there was no template or model, the early days of cheesemaking were not easy. However, after a visit to the French Pyrenées, David became inspired to make sheep`s milk cheese in the tradition of those made in the Pyrenées. At the farm, they dug their own maturing cave, which is built into the side of a hill at the farm and where cheeses mature for two to six months.To make Verano, raw sheep’s milk is heated and starter cultures and rennet are added. After coagulation, the curds are cut. The whey is drained off and the remaining curd is packed into colander shaped molds, which give the cheese its distinctive flying saucer shape. The cheeses are pressed and drained before being brined. They are then transferred to the underground aging caves. Verano is aged between three to six months.Vermont Shepherd has a golden brown rind and a smooth, firm, ivory-colored paste.Flavors are deliciously rustic and sweet, underpinned by notes of caramel, earth,and hay—pleasingly full-flavored and profound, but not overwhelming. The cheese is aromatic and herbaceous, like mint and thyme."

Cow`s milk is brought in from the 400-strong herd of Jersey cows at nearby Spring Hill Dairy. Prior to becoming a cheesemaker, Soyoung had a successful career working as a biochemist in both the engineering and science worlds. She also has a strong background in classical music as an avid pianist, making her a rare combination of talents that seem to converge over the cheesemaking vat. Having studied the properties of milk and cheesemaking intensely for two years, including a stint at Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, Soyoung has become a highly respected figure in the artisan cheese industry. She is known for producing small quantities of extremely high quality cheeses, many of which are made in the French style. By choice, Soyoung works alone. Her cheesemaking facility is clean, simple, highly organized and has plenty of space to move about. Her early cheesemaking career was greatly encouraged and inspired by Thomas Keller, the owner and chef of the French Laundry in Yountville. Keller and Scanlan both have a tremendous eye for detail and perfection, and it is these qualities that shine though in all aspects of Scanlan`s cheese. At Andante, Scanlan produces a range of cheeses made from cow, sheep and goat`s milk, or combinations of the three.Vivace is a seasonal mixed milk cheese in the shape of a large puck. It has a thin bloomy rind covering a somewhat dense and rich paste that melts on the tongue.

Schad has been making cheese since 1976, when she and her husband moved with their three young children from the suburbs to a hill farm in southern Indiana. They sought a sustainable lifestyle, a milk cow, and lots of gardens. When they ran the title on their new farm they discovered that it had belonged to Judy`s husband`s great, great grandfather in the 1870s. Schad wanted to build a working model that others could follow, but since there were no guidelines for commercial goat dairying, they based their model, through trial and error, on an older, more traditional dairy, centered on herd health, longevity, productivity and on animals who are born, live, and die on the same farm. Her goats comprise Alpine, Saanen and Nubian breeds. Sheproduces goat`s milk cheeses across a wide spectrum of styles. Named after the famous train and eponymous song of southern Indiana, production of the Wabash Cannonball began in 1992. Dusted with ash, the cheese is thin skinned, white, and slightly wrinkled when young. At three weeks therind becomes more deeply wrinkled and the ash begins to peek through. The paste becomes denser, and eventually, at three to five weeks, is drier and more crumbly.Cannonballs have a semisoft paste with a gentle, creamy, slightly acidic flavor. The rind, originally a fluffy mushroomy covering of Penicilium candidum mold that gives the cheese a snowball-like appearance, changes to a more wrinkled surface of Geotrichum candidum, which produces a musky, slightly sweet and more delicate flavor. This is a relatively minor adjustment since it doesn`t affect the paste much.Cannonballs mix well with light-bodied, dry whites such as sauvignon blanc or grüner veltliner."

At various times having been home to a subsistence farm, a dairy farm and a thriving egg business, the property was purchased by Jennifer Hines and Pete Schropp in 1986. Hines, who loves cooking and had been experimenting with cheesemaking in her kitchen, and Schropp, who loves animals and had been raising dairy heifers for nearby farms, turned to cheesemaking in order to create a value-added product that would keep the historic farm financially viable. They opened Rockhill Creamery in 2005. In 2007, they finished construction of an underground cheese aging facility. Today they produce cheese twice a week using only the milk from their six Brown Swiss cows. Cheese at Rockhill farm is produced in 125-gallon batches. After ripening and coagulation of the raw milk, the curd mass is cut into cubes, then stirred and “cooked” for 50 minutes. Whey is drained off, and then the curd is put into cheesecloth-lined hoops. Hoops are left on the drain table, where they’re turned and flipped five times that afternoon before the wheels are moved to a brine solution and then into the aging cave. Wasatch Mountain can be aged anywhere from 2 months to 1 yearor more before going to market (versions aged over 1 year are labeled Wasatch Mountain Reserve).When ready for sale, Wasatch Mountain has crumbly and firm paste with small holes.

In the early 1900s there were hundreds of farms in the valleys and the when the creamery at Hawes was set up in the 1930`s, it was one of the first factories in England to collect milk from many farms and make cheese centrally.As the recipe of the cheese changed to accommodate this large-scale production, the cheese became firmer, although in recent years Hawes Creamery has been working to try and recreate the more traditional type and texture of an original Wensleydale. Somewhat unusually these days, Hawes make their own starter cultures, a factor that has considerable impact on the flavor and development of the final cheese.Hawes Wensleydale has a lower acidity than most Wensleydales, meaning there is more depth and subtlety of flavor, rather than a one-dimensional acidity.Currently, most producers of Wensleydale use cow`s milk, although occasionally sheep`s milk is used.Wensleydale is usually eaten young, when it is finely textured, flaky and moist, whereas mature Wensleydale is drier. Yorkshire`s limestone soil gives the cheese a gentle flavor, beautifully balanced by an underlying and slightly tart freshness.The cheese is traditionally eaten with fruitcake or apple pie and complemented with a medium dry white wine."

The first day’s curd rests overnight, and at the end of the second day’s make, these colder, more acidic curds are mixed with the freshly made, warm curds. It’s a more traditional method of production that is rarely used due to the long and labor-intensive process. “In our case,” says Fritz Schaal, “we think it is well worth the effort.” The cheese is aged between five and ten months.Cream-colored with blue veining, West West Blue smells sweet and slightly pungent with notes of flowers. Paste is soft and velvety with a slight crunch from the blue mold and a texture that melts in the mouth. On the palate, an initial hit of sharpness dissipates into a mushroomy, rounded earthiness. Strong yet balanced salty and sweet flavors dominate, with additional notes of grass, barnyard and burnt sugar.Pair West West Blue with a barley wine, a big fat California zinfandel, or a vermouth such as Lacuesta Reserve."

Cheese is produced by owner Larry Peter, whose herd of pasture-grazed Jersey cows provide the high-butterfat milk. The Petaluma Creamery, which was founded in 1913 and purchased by Peter in 1987, produces a range of products including quark, butter, and several cheddar and jack cheeses. The creamery also provides a place for neighboring farmers to process their milk into value-added products. Cows are milked twice daily, and milk is delivered directly to Petaluma Creamery, where it is pasteurized. Starter cultures are added as well as vegetarian rennet, and the curd is cut. The whey is removed and sent to the dairy for the cows to drink, or is made into other by-products. The curd then forms a mass, which is placed in a trough, eventually cut into blocks with a knife and turned as they continue to drain. After draining the cheese is put through a curd mill, which cuts the cheese into small pieces, allowing cheesemakers to then incorporate salt, herbs and seasonings. Mixtures are tied in cheesecloth and formed into 40-pound blocks. After 12 hours of pressing the wheels are vacuum-sealed and refrigerated. White Cheddar is aged for 2-3 years.Fudgy and soft, with a creamy mouthfeel, this organic White Cheddar has a slight tang and a sharp finish. It makes for an excellent burger cheese.Pair it with a pinot grigio or with a wheat beer. "

There, they make three excellent cheeses: Spenwood, Wigmore and WaterlooAs a graduate from the school of Dairy Science at Reading University, Anne, together with her husband Andy, began making cheese during the 1980`s. They were spurred on in this effort by Patrick Rance, who owned a cheese shop nearby and whose passionate desire to prevent small-scale British cheesemakers from disappearing altogether resulted in a renaissance of British cheese production.The Wigmores` Village Maid Cheese Company has, over the years, played an important role in the re-introduction of sheep`s milk cheese to Britain. Sheep`s milk cheeses had almost disappeared by the 18th century and it is only in rlatively recent times - since the 1980`s that they have startd to make a comeback. However, in the early days of their business when they required only small quantities of milk, ironically it was far easier to buy in small amounts of sheep`s milk than cow`s milk. That, in addition to becoming inspired by the sheep`s milk cheeses of Sardinia after a holiday there, proved to be the main deciding factors for their sheep cheese production.For production of their Wigmore cheese, the Anne and Andy source sheep`s milk from dairies in Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. During production, the curds are washed, meaning that a quantity of the whey is removed from the vat and replaced with water. This has the effect of reducing acidity and, characteristically, cheeses produced in this way tend to have smooth, yielding, semi soft textures.After the whey/water is drained off, the curds are packed into the molds to drain further.

Wild Boar,Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse,United States,South Carolina,4 in diameter x 2.5 in height,14 oz,www.charlestoncheesehouse.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Semi Soft,Vegetable,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),Flavor added to paste,"Charleston Artisan Cheesehouse crafts and ages a range of cheeses on location in Charleston, South Carolina. Since 2014 the creamery has been owned by chefs Greg Tatis and Monica Jaramillo, who specialize in recipe development and cheesemaking, as well as by Pete and Heather Holmes, who specialize in sales and marketing. The four owners strive to create wholesome cheeses that inspire the joy of eating locally produced, artisanal foods. The cultures used in production are chosen to create cheeses with taste and quality characteristics comparable to raw/thermized milk cheeses. Milk used in production of the cheeses is sourced from Hickory Hill Milk, which has been owned and operated by Watson Dorn and his family the same land for 20 generations. Cows graze freely on pasture for 18 hours a day, and antibiotics are never added to feed. Milk is hormone free and non-homogenized, and pasteurization is performed at a low temperature in an effort to maintain as many of the milk’s natural enzymes as possible. Wild Boar is a flavored version of Charleston Cheesehouse’s flagship Battery Park. Described as a cross between a brie and a farm cheese, the production process for these these bloomy-rinded discs is completely done by hand, from pouring the milk into the vat, to molding, flipping, wrapping and labeling. In production of this version, wild mushrooms and Oregon black truffles are incorporated into the curd. Discs are aged for three to four weeks.Flavor is mild, with woody and earthy notes and a black truffle aroma due to the addition of mushrooms.Pair Wild Boar with a Pinot Grigio, a witbier or alongside fresh cantaloupe."
Wilde Weide,Jan and Roos van Schie,Netherlands,Zuid Holland,16-19 in diameter,25 lbs,www.essexcheese.com,Cow,Raw,Firm,Animal,Waxed,Gouda-like,,"Jan and Roos van Schie produce this traditional Boerenkaas (farmhouse) Gouda on a lake island known as Zwanburgerpolder in the south of Holland. The organic farm, which was originally built during the 1700s, has a herd of Montbeliarde and red Friesian cows that graze on the island pastures throughout the year. They produce Wilde Weide, which translates as “wild meadow,” in small quantities a few times per week throughout the year. In production of Wilde Weide, raw milk is coagulated using traditional rennet, and curds are cut into 1/3-inch lumps. The curds are stirred to ripen in the vat, and then ‘washed’ with fresh hot water before being placed in their molds. The wheels are then pressed with a hand-cranked press for at least 24 hours before they are bathed in brine for 36 hours. Wheels are then placed in an on-site aging facility to ripen for 15 months. Wilde Weide is imported to the U.S. by Essex Street Cheese.Wilde Weide has a firm, straw yellow paste with a few well-shaped eyes and a speckling of amino acid crystals. On the palate the cheese has a distinct texture, crumbling info fine fragments before melting completely. The cheese is creamy and mildly sharp, with notes of hazelnut, butter, whey, and bourbon, and a long finish.Pair Wilde Weide with a Syrah, a mid-fruity Gewürztraminer or a Riesling."

Willoughby was first conceived by Marisa Mauro at Ploughgate Creamery. However, in September 2011 the creamery suffered a devastating fire and, no longer able to produce the cheese, Marisa sold the recipe to Jasper Hill. One year and some development tweaks later, the cheese was incorporated into Jasper Hill`s range.The texture of Willoughby is semisoft and silky, with occasional holes and a pale, caramel-colored paste. Willoughby’s thin, tacky rind imparts lightly pungent, savory flavors that evolve into notes of cream and tropical fruit with the interior paste.Rory Stamp from Dedalus Wine Shop, Market, and Wine Bar in Burlington, Vt. compares the ""pudgy little stinker"" to the coveted Reblochon, from the Savoie.“In cooler months, Willoughby makes a brilliant tartiflette, broiled over roasted potatoes, leeks, and lardons with a glass of Mondeuse,” he says. “In the summer, we let it ooze into a pancake [shape] and go at it with cornichons, potato chips, walnut Dijon, and some sparkling Gringet.”"

It is off the grid, and powered by solar and hydro-electric systems installed by Vern, a former career Marine.The dairy herd consists of about 30 milking goats. The Caldwells initially chose Nigerian Dwarfs for a 4H project for their young daughter (due to their managable size). Several years later, Gianaclis and Vern find themselves with one of the best herds in the country. They have worked hard on improving genetics and the goats lead a happy life, listening to National Public Radio and jazz, and grazing at pasture for as much of the year as the weather permits.Gianaclis makes cheese in a room adjacent to (but separated from) the milking parlor and the main barn. The quality of the goats` milk is outstanding and Gianclis approaches cheesemaking in a very methodical and diligent way.Wimer Winter is made only during the fall and winter, when the humidity in the aging room is just right and the milk is at its densest. Wimer Winter is washed with a bacterium linens culture and therefore has a slightly pungent rind, overlaid with salt.Wheels are aged 60-80 days."

Goats are fed mainly on haylage (high quality forage) and a concentrate.Richard uses a portable milking machine, which can take six animals at a time and the goats are milked twice daily. Richard works mainly with the goats and on the cheesemaking, while Renee works the nine markets they go to each month.The cheesemaking process takes around 72 hours in all. The Loveridges make cheese based on a traditional French recipe, and produce a fresh, soft cheese, one of which they market as a pure, unflavored variety; they also do Dainty Herb, made with fresh herbs; a peppercorn-coated cheese; and a garlic and crack pepper cheese. In addition, they produce a drinking-style pro-biotic yogurt, similar to a smoothie."
Winnimere,Jasper Hill Farm,United States,Vermont,,13 oz,jasperhillfarm.com,Cow,Raw,Semi Soft,Animal,Washed,Washed-RindSoft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Winnimere is a seasonal cheese that shows off the richness of winter milk from Jasper Hill`s hay-fed Ayrshire cows. Winnimere—named for a corner of Caspian Lake—is a washed-rind cheese that`s wrapped in spruce bark and produced only from November to April. During its two month maturation, Winnimere is regularly brushed with a cultured salt brine. Inspired by Alpine cheeses like Vacherin Mont d`Or, the wheel is wrapped in a strip of spruce barkthat`s cut from trees on Jasper Hill`s land. The bark helps maintain the cheese`s shape, while also imparting a woodsy flavor. Located in the beautiful rolling countryside of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont, Jasper Hill Farm was bought by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler in 1998. When the farm came into their possession, it was extremely run-down, but by 2003, after five years of hard work, Andy and Mateo acquired their first 15 Ayrshire heifers. Thanks to careful management and focus on building excellent genetics, they now have one of the highest quality milking herds in the United States. The herd grazes from late spring to early fall, and over successive years, the grazing land at Jasper Hill has been improved by planting a wide variety of clovers, grasses,and legumes to enhance the flavor of the milk. More recently, Jasper Hill became involved with milk production at Andersonville Farm in nearby Glover, Vermont; that milk is now used to produce cheeses at Jasper Hill and at the farm`s private cell in the Vermont Food Venture Center. In 2015, the Kehlers teamed up with German company AgriCompact Technologies to produce a hay drying facility: The Randi Albert Calderwood Cropping Center is the first of its kind in the United States. The brothers have also developed another arm of the business, The Cellars at Jasper Hill. The Cellars, which comprise 22,000 square feet of cheese maturing caves, were designed and built not only to house Jasper Hill`s own cheeses but also to mature the cheeses of other Vermont producers. Jasper Hill`s own range of cheeses includes Alpha Tolman, Bayley Hazen Blue, Constant Bliss, Harbison, and Moses Sleeper.When ripe, Winnimere`sinterior is smooth, velvety, and almost soup-like with complex and layered flavors. Notes of milk, grass, almonds, and wood balance each other and leave a lingering savory finish. The flavorbecomes more intense closer to the rind, where crystallized amino acids add a slightly crunchy texture.Peel off a bit of Winnimere`s top rind and dig in with a hunk of baguette—or eat with a spoon. Pair it with a porter or a meaty, smoky red wine."
Woman of La Mancha,Gothberg Farms,United States,Washington,"7.5 ins diameter, 3.5 ins high",4.5 lbs,www.gothbergfarms.com,Goat,,Firm,Animal,Paprika,,,"Gothberg Farms is situated on forty acres of flat, fertile farmland overlooking Mt Baker near Bow in Washington state. Rhonda and Roy Gothberg bought the property in 2001. At the time, it was a former cow dairy that had become run-down, so they initiated a program of extensive repairs and renovations with a view to making it suitable for a dairy goat farm and creamery. The first goats arrived at Gothberg in April 2002. Having originally started with two does, Rhonda quickly found that she had more milk than the family could consume and decided to try her hand at making cheese. Encouraged by the results, she was inspired to continue. After completing the Cheesemakers’ Short Course at Washington State University, she set about the construction of a new barn and cheesemaking facility. Milk is sourced from Gothberg Farm’s own herd of 20 milking purebred LaMancha goats; a breed known for its quality milk that contains high levels of fat and protein. At any given time there are about 50 LaMancha goats on the farm. This includes the milking does, non-milking does, kids, and bucks. Rhonda produces a wide variety of hand crafted cheeses at Gothberg Farms using her 52 gallon vat pasteurizer. Made in the style of Spanish cheeses such as Ibores, Woman of LaMancha is made from raw goat’s milk and coated with smoked Spanish paprika on the rind.Cheeses are aged for a minimum of one year before release. The resulting flavors are resolutely robust, with notes of cellar and earth and an assertive tang.Woman of LaMancha pairs well with big, red wines such as Cabernet or Rioja and holds its own on any cheese board as well as alongside a charcuterie selection."

Originally from New Zealand, both Jean and Linnea were raised on farms. They moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago, settling into a property in Maine that has belonged to Jean’s husband’s family for several generations. Now they produce small batches of cheese each day, using milk from their herd of approximately 28 goats, sometimes also using organic Jersey milk from a neighbor’s farm. Inspired by cheeses of the Alps such as Comet and Gruyère, Woodside is the Koons’ cow’s milk version of their goat’s milk Alpine cheese. Aged for 10 to 14 months and sold in wedges, Woodside hardens as it ages and lends itself well to crumbling or grating.With aromas of butter and grass, Woodside has a subtler, more delicate taste than its goat’s milk counterpart.Pair Woodside with a Reisling or with a pale ale."
Woolly Rind,Green Dirt Farm,United States,Missouri,3.5 in diameter x 1.5 in height,7-8 oz,www.greendirtfarm.com,Cow,,Semi Soft,Animal,Mold Ripened,,," On the bluffs of the Missouri River Valley about 40 miles northwest of Kansas City, MO, Green Dirt Farm stands on steep rolling hills overlooking the countryside. Farmer Jacqueline Smith and cheesemaker Sarah Hoffman have owned and operated the farmstead creamery here since 2002. Jacqueline and Sarah specialize in sheep’s milk cheeses, yogurt and grass-fed lamb, focusing all the while on sustainability and high quality. Because of the steepness of the land and the erodible nature of the soil, the ground at the farm is best suited for permanent pasture. Jacqueline and Sarah make sure that animals rotate pastures every 12-24 hours to ensure nutritious, diverse grazing and to prevent soil erosion. No synthetic chemicals, pesticides, or hormones are used on the farm, and antibiotics are used only to treat animals if they’re sick. Green Dirt Farm has also invested in renewable energy sources, including solar power and wind electricity generation. Woolly Rind is Jacqueline and Sarah’s take on the classic Camembert. It has a bloomy rind that’s sometimes mottled with flecks of tan, blue or orange as the cheese ages. It’s aged for at least three weeks, and up to eight weeks, transforming from firm to softer and creamier. At its peak, it becomes runny at room temperature.When young, Woolly Rind has flavors of milk and grass, with a slight tang. As it ages it develops an aroma of forest floor and buttery, mushroom flavors, with a natural sweetness to the rind.Like all of Green Dirt Farm’s farmstead cheeses, seasonal changes in milk are reflected in the cheese. Woolly Rind is firmer in the spring with more milky flavors, while in the fall it tends towards soft and gooey, almost spreadable, with more buttery and nutty flavors.Pair it with Eau de Vie, Lillet, Pastis, olives, almonds or quince paste."
Wrångebäck,Almnäs Bruk,Sweden,Västra Götaland,12 in diameter,22 lbs,www.almnas.com,Cow,Raw,Hard,Animal,Natural,Alpine-style,," To take a bite of Wrångebäck, the first registered cheese brand in Sweden, is to step back in time—to 1896, perhaps, when the cheese was served at a farewell reception for Andrée, the famous balloonist, on the eve of his disastrous expedition to the North Pole, or to 1935, when it was served at the Swedish Parliament’s 500th anniversary dinner. It all started at Almnäs Bruk, a farm situated on the picturesque west coast of the second largest lake in Sweden, Lake Vättern. It was founded in the 19th century by the great-grandfather of current managing director Thomas Berglund, who transformed the property’s former brick factory into a cheesemaking facility—a function that upheld until 1961. In 1987 due to his father’s poor health, Berglund returned to the estate from Switzerland, where he had been working, and decided to start making cheese. After many years of planning, traveling to France and Switzerland to study cheesemaking, and gaining organic certification, he re-started cheese production on the property in 2008. Today Almnäs Bruk makes a modern version of its original cheese. Wheels are aged for at least one year—sometimes as much as three—on the same wooden planks that were used in the original dairy. During that time, they’re washed with salt water less and less frequently, until the rind turns from creamy white to orange, ultimately transforming into a deep reddish-brown. Exuding aromas of buttered pumpernickel toast, this cheese’s dense, fudgy paste dotted with crystals yields supersavory umami on the palate. Notes of warm milk and penuche fudge linger.Pair it with salami or an IPA."
Camembert (Marin French Cheese),Marin French Cheeese Co.,United States,California,"4 ins diameter, 1-2 ins high",8 oz,www.marinfrenchcheese.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Microbial,Mold Ripened,Soft-Ripened (Brie-like),,"Located just west of Petaluma in northern California, the Marin French Cheese Company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson A. Thompson, largely as a response to the burgeoning demand for cheese arising from returning Gold Rush miners. Today it’s the oldest continuously operating creamery in the United States. Milk for cheese production originally came from the company`s own herds of cattle that grazed the 700 acres of land surrounding the creamery. However, during the Depression of the 1930`s, Marin French decided to focus its efforts entirely on production and try to support its neighbors by buying in milk from local farms. This arrangement continues today.To make the cheese, cow`s milk is pasteurized and poured into `make` buckets. Bacterial starters are added to each bucket and then the microbial rennet and either a mold or yeast culture are added. (The mold and yeast cultures are interchanged regularly every few days of production, since this promotes the health of each culture and keeps them alive.)With the addition of the rennet, the milk coagulates. It is then cut into cubes using a long bladed knife and gently stirred at regular intervals. As the acidity level rises, the curds become firmer until they reach a point where they are ready to be poured into the molds and allowed to drain naturally. The cheeses are unmolded and brined, then placed on racks to dry before they’re transferred to the aging rooms where they will spend 10-14 days before release. The cheeses are turned once during this time to promote mold growth.Full flavored with a smooth, dense, and buttery texture. Throughout its different stages, the cheese possesses a lactic tanginess which is balanced out by the buttery flavors and underlying notes of nuts and hay during the summer months. Cheeses made from spring milk are particularly yellow in color and have an added buttery characteristic.Pair it with a Chenin Blanc, a Champagne or with a cider from Normandy."
Za'atar Burrata,Fiore di Nonno,United States,Massachusetts,,4.75 oz,www.fioredinonno.com,Cow,Pasteurised,Soft,Vegetable,None,Pasta Filata (mozzarella-type),Flavor added to paste,"Lourdes Smith comes from a long line of Italian cheesemakers; her great-grandfather Alphonso Fiore made cheese in Italy and then in Hoboken, New Jersey after immigrating to the US. She was inspired early on by watching her grandfather Joe, who had taken over Alphonso’s shop, making mozzarella, ricotta and basket cheese. Her business in Somerville, Massachusetts, whose name translates into “my grandfather’s flower,” is a salute to him. Lourdes sources mozzarella curd from partner farms. She recently worked with Shy Brothers Farm in Westport, MA, which is run by two sets of fraternal twins, to develop a curd recipe using their antibiotic and hormone-free cow’s milk. Shy Brothers’ cows graze on pasture in a peninsula that juts out into the Westport River. After Lourdes receives the curd, she transforms it by hand each morning in her Somerville, MA kitchen. The cheesemaking process begins by breaking the curd into even pieces using a tool called a guitar. Lourdes then adds hot water to the curd, which slowly brings it up to melting temperature so that it can be stretched using a wooden paddle, then shaped. Burrata originated in the Murgia area of Italy. It’s a disk of fresh mozzarella that is shaped into a pouch, inside of which is stuffed stracciatella (a mix of fresh cream, salt and curds that have been pulled into strings). Fiore di Nonno Burrata is made in several unique combinations that play with sweetness, savory and tangy flavors. Za’atar Burrata is filled with labne (a thick Middle Eastern kefir cheese), Italian mascarpone, and za’atar, a Middle Eastern herb mixture.The outside layer of mozzarella, which is moist, refreshing and soft, surrounds an inside layer of creamy, buttery stracciatella. Za`atar spice contributes flavors of thyme and lemon. Try serving Fiore di Nonno`s Za`atar Burrata with roasted beets."
Zamorano,Various,Spain,Castilla y León,"8-9 ins diameter, 4-5 ins high",4-8lbs,,Sheep,,Firm,Animal,Plasticoat,,,"Similar in many ways to the more famous Manchego, Zamorano was known as Manchego until the cheese was given its own recognized PDO (name protected) status. Named after Zamora, the principal city of its home region, the reason for the demarcation was to distinguish the differences between the two cheeses:Zamorano is made in the area around Castilla y León in the north-west of Spain, and must be produced using milk from the breeds of Churra and Castellana sheep, whereas Manchego comes from the Castile-La Mancha Region, southeast of Madrid and is made from the milk of Manchega sheep. Zamorano is made seasonally from the end of the winter months through to the end of the summer. Cheeses are produced from raw milk and can be sold at several ages ranging from three months to one year. This particular version of Zamorano (pictured) is is aged six months and produced by Hijos de Salvador Rodriguez, who have been making cheese since 1947. Milk for production is sourced from the herds of local shepherds.Churra and Castellana sheep are renowned for giving rich milk that’s high in fat and protein. These characteristics translate into flavors of underlying sweetness balanced with a lactic acidity and rich, buttery milky notes. With age, especially after six months, these become more pronounced and distinctive from other pressed sheep’s milk cheeses and its possible to taste and smell notes of lanolin, butterscotch, sweet cooked butter and dried fruits and nuts. The texture of Zamorano is firm and liberally scattered with holes or “eyes” that are fairly uniform in size. The interior paste, while pale ivory colored in young cheeses, develops and changes with age, becoming darker and more straw-like.Pair it with a Tempranillo."

Although the region has long been associated with the production of sheep’s milk cheeses, the climatic conditions of temperature and humidity do not naturally lend themselves to making this style of cheese. Zelu Koloria is made between June and November. Cheeses are available for sale year round and sold at varying ages with the youngest usually being released at three months. Wheels have a natural rind that is regularly brushed during the maturation period. On younger cheeses, the rind can be quite dry but as the cheese ages it becomes more moist, thereby lending a tangy richness to the flavor of the cheese.The interior paste is dense and semi-soft in texture, shot through with deep veins and pockets of blue mold, often distributed unevenly throughout.  Spring cheeses have a lightness of taste and texture that intensifies as the season progresses.  Although cheeses are sold during the winter months after production has finished, the flavors of these fully matured versions are very strong to the point of being overwhelming.Suggested wine pairings include Juracon Moelleux or Port."
Ziege Zacke Blue,Roelli Cheese Haus / LaClare Farm,United States,Wisconsin,,7 lb,http://www.laclarefarm.com,GoatCow,,Blue,Vegetable,Natural,,," Ziege Zacke Blue is the product of a collaboration between LaClare Farm and Roelli Cheese Haus in Wisconsin. Located near Chilton, just north of Milwaukee and close to the shores of Lake Michigan, LaClare Farm is owned by Larry & Clara Hedrich and their family. It’s a small-scale goat dairy with extremely high milk quality standards. The does have room to exercise and graze on pasture, and are fed whole grains and other foods that goats love. Roelli Cheese Haus was founded in the 1920s, when Adolph Roelli, a Swiss immigrant, landed in Lafayette County, WI. Four generations later, Chris Roelli leads the cheesemaking process in the exact same spot. In the past two decades, Chris has led Roelli cheese to shift its focus from industrial cheddar production to small-scale, artisanal production of American originals. With the recent completion of a state-of the art aging cellar, Chris’s production has doubled, and his repertoire continues to expand. This cheese (pronounced “zeegy zacky”) is crafted using goat’s milk from Hedrich Farms and cow’s milk sourced by Roelli Cheese. It’s made twice a month at Roelli’s, aged for four months in Roelli’s cellars, and is marketed by LaClare. Ziege Zacke Blue is modeled after a Dry Jack but demonstrates more complexity. It’s encouraged to develop just a small amount of veining during its aging, mellowing its blue flavors.The blue veins contribute a mild spiciness and goat’s milk contributes a slight tang at the front, while its finish is sweet and buttery. It’s characterized by rich earthy and mild bluesy notes.Ziege Zacke Blue is great on cheese boards and makes an excellent introductory blue cheese. Pair it with a Pinot Noir or a Syrah."
