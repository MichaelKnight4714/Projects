Afuega'l Pitu,pasteurized or unpasteurized cow's milk,Spain,Asturias,"soft, artisan",smooth,cloth wrapped,"spicy, strong",,no,,"'Afuega’l Pitu' is one of the oldest Spanish cheeses. It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.The cheese is produced from cow's full-fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and river Nalón in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.The cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the aging period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's miter or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atroncáu' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega’L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted as a ""tapa"" or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega’L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually moldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.Though this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!Afuega’l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.The name 'Afuega’l Pitu' is derived from the ""bable"" Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes  the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega’l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom ‘drowning the rooster’ refering to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. It is shaped into a wheel that can be effectively sliced into wedged for consumption. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda such as a five-year aged cheese develops such a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat it alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to its caramel and robust flavour.Gouda cheese as a hard cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when it is paired with some white wines and any fruity wine.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the ageing time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape.The pâté is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savoury flavour infused by the bacteria, beautifully complements the distinct notes of butter and cream.Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full-bodied reds such as Rhone’s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah.

At first, it was made from a mixture of cheeses, more often than not Colby and Cheddar. Since blended cheeses are no longer used, it cannot be legally called “cheese” and has to be labelled as “processed cheese”, “cheese product“, etc. Sometimes, instead of the word cheese, it is called ""American slices"" or ""American singles"". Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, American cheese is a type of pasteurised processed cheese.Depending on the percentage of cheese versus additives, the taste and texture of American cheese may vary. Also, the colour may change from orange, yellow to white as decided by the food manufacturer.Processed American cheese is sold in three varieties – individually wrapped cheese slices, small pre-sliced blocks and large blocks. Before cheese slices were invented, block American cheese was the only one available and hence is also considered ""classic"" or ""traditional"" American cheese.American cheese though criticized for its high fat and sodium content is still used in regular cooking as it melts well and contains a good amount of calcium and protein.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It is a product that is peelable and when it is peeled, it separates from the larger cheese in strips. Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting, the cheese either crumbles or breaks apart. In case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.In Middle East countries of Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep’s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole cow's milk. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name ‘jibneh mshallaleh’. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and licorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo.The flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth.

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era.The cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheese makers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some of the producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese.Banon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.  The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour.The local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar and the cheese left to ferment, with just the sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes.Banon goes well with crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It is semi-soft cheese inoculated with a Penicillium mold and aged in a cellar for at least 4-5 weeks.

Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odor from bacteria that are used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft and the rind slightly dry.

The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like croûte au brie.

Brie is a soft cheese named after the French region Brie, where it was originally created. Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings.In France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. ""Real"" French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections.Brie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added in to raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37°C to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into molds, several layers of cheese are filled into mold and then kept for around 18 hours. After this the cheese is salted and aged for minimum four weeks.Brie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese.Brie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2 kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

The name Bryndza comes from Wallachian, the Romanian word for cheese. There are three types of Bryndza, each prepared differently thus giving the cheese a characteristic texture, taste and colour. Both Slovenská bryndza and Bryndza Podhalańska have been registered in the EU as a PDO cheese in 2008 and 2006, respectively.  There is one more variety of Bryndza that contains only sheep's milk and is called liptovská or ovčia bryndza.While the Slovak variety must have 50% sheep's milk to account for protected designation, the Polish variety of Bryndza contains 60% sheep's milk. In contrast, 100% sheep's milk is used to make liptovská or ovčia bryndza, the least produced variety of Bryndza.The texture, flavour and colour of Bryndza are dependent on how it is made or prepared. Generally, the cheese is quite salty and crumbly if standard salt is used but some producers add saline solution to make it salty, which then changes the texture to soft and spreadable. It is white to gray in colour, tangy to taste and slightly moist. The flavour graph starts from being slightly mild to going strong and then fading with a salty finish. Bryndza is the main ingredient in bryndzové halušky, the national favorite of Slovakia. Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It was first made in Caerphilly in about 1830. Its texture and flavour bears resemblance to cheddar, which is the most popular type of cheese in the United Kingdom. This cheese is known as ""the crumblies"".The recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired from other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its tough texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals.Caerphilly is made from unpasteurised cows' milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a harder texture and stronger taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel-shape with ivory-white rind dusted with fine flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and gray moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian depending upon the brand.A basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese.

Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavour and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of a cheddar cheese can vary.Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow’s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its aging time.In Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize winning cheddar maker in all Canada, is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada include cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.Mild and Medium Cheddars are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelets, sandwiches and as garnish. Old Cheddar can be used for shredding, slicing and pairs well with white wines and pale ales/lager. Extra Old Cheddar compliments white wines, red wines & rose wines. It is best used for rich, creamy sauces, shredding, baking.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

Its similarity to camembert has earned Caravane the nickname, ‘camelbert cheese’. Her dairy, Tiviski, located in the capital of West African Mauritania makes this cheese with the help of milk collected from the local camel herds. Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield.By using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine.Since the Mauritanians don’t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores.Caravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow’s, buffalo’s, sheep’s or goat’s cheese.

It is either round or half-cylinder shape with a rind that is engraved with the mark left by the wooden mould. The greyish-dark brown colour of the rind conceals a yellow coloured pate. This cheese comes from the Spanish region of Castile-Leon, which accounts for 85% production of pure sheep's milk cheese. Castigliano best represents the cheese-producing region.The ripening process of Castigliano lasts at least two months to develop a medium mature and mature age cheese. It comes in pieces ranging between a kilo and 3.5kg. The cheese is similar to Manchego but comparatively, it is quite moist and has a few rice-sized holes. Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level. Nowadays, a recent variety of cheese produced with a mixture of cows, ewes and goat’s milk has a somewhat mild flavour.

Here, in this case, Chabichou du Poitou is manufactured on a small area in the Poitou, Berry and Perigord regions of France. Made with whole fresh goat’s milk, the cheese won Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 1990 guaranteeing the authenticity of the produce. The cheese is produced only by a few farmsteads or cheese retailers and is sold locally.The cheese comes in the shape of a truncated cylinder called ""bonde"", approximately 6 cm in height and 5 to 6 cm in diameter. After 10 days of the maturing process, Chabichou contains a minimum 45% fat and comes coated with a thin layer of grey-blue islets. If the cheese is made by a farmstead, it is naturally allowed to develop the mould, whereas Penicillium is inserted into the cheese if made by a dairy. The cheese is sold at a minimum maturing age of 2 weeks but may be matured for five to six weeks to acquire an intense aroma and flavour.Upon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. Cut the cheese and it reveals a firm, creamy “bright white” interior but not before unwinding a thin buttery layer. Even though it smells typically “goaty”, the flavours are sweet with a bit of salty and tangy edge at the end. As the cheese ages, it becomes savoury, piquant and nutty. Balance the flavours of the cheese with light white wine, champagne, and pilsner beer.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

Another variant is a Blue Cheshire ripened with Penicillium culture moulds.An aged Cheshire becomes firmer and darkens considerably. It is now a full-flavoured cheese yet with no hint of bitterness.

Chevre,pasteurized or unpasteurized goat's milk,France,,"soft, semi-soft, hard, firm",firm and soft,,"earthy, tangy, tart",,,,"Chevre is French for Goat’s cheese i.e. cheeses made out of goat’s milk. They are popular among elderly and children who are more likely to show low tolerance to cow’s milk. Also, goat cheeses are lower in fat and higher in vitamin A and potassium. They serve as a perfect substitute for many dieters. A majority of goat cheeses come from France, the most famous among them being Bucheron, Chabis and Crottin de Chavignol.Goat cheeses have a unique, tart, earthy flavour that sets them apart from cow cheeses. This distinctive tang and aroma grow robust and bold as it ages. Milk production of goats, unlike of cow’s, is seasonal from mid-March through October. Only a few kinds of cheese are aged beyond four months and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd.The flavour and aroma of goat cheese rely upon its moisture, density, ageing and flavouring. It can feature a soft, semisoft, firm, or hard texture that indicates its moisture content. They come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shaped, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or before dinner drinks.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

After Chevrotin was awarded the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 2002, the cheese came to be produced exclusively in the Haute Savoie region of France.The cheese should be a mix of the raw milk of one herd of goats. Produced only a farmstead, milk should come from a herd containing 80% Alpine breed goats. To guarantee the authenticity of the produce and AOC stamp, the diameter of each cheese cylinder must measure 9 to 12cm and a length of 3 to 4.5cm. It should contain 45% fat and weigh between 250 to 350 grams.Chevrotin des Aravis is a washed rind cheese made similar to a Reblochon, except with goat’s milk. The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats. Chevrotin des Aravis pairs well with Cotes du Rhone, Bandol, Mondeuse, Chignin-bergeron, Saint-joseph and Savoie wines.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

There are two main varieties of Chhurpi; the soft variety prepared out of cow's milk and the hard variety prepared out of yak's milk. Chhurpi is made by separating whey from buttermilk solids to produce curds similar to Italian Ricotta. Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals. Chhur singba or Chhur mingba is freshly prepared Chhurpi prepared by adding the extract of crab apple fruits (thung).Hard Durkha or Chhurpi is made out of yak milk.

It is many-a-times compared to cheddar cheese since both are dyed to appear orange, even though they taste radically different. Due to U.S. dairy regulations, Colby cheese is made from pasteurised cow’s milk and is available at many grocery stores.The cheese was developed in the 1874 by Joseph Steinwand at his cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin. While the cheese looks similar Cheddar due to the colour, Colby cheese is softer, has a more open texture and higher moisture content. The flavour is much milder and creamy if compared to Cheddar. It does not undergo the “cheddaring” process but is instead manufactured with a washed curd process that reduces the acid content making the cheese less tangy.An aged Colby becomes cracked and dry and therefore the cheese is to be eaten as young as possible. Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Shiraz wines pair well with the American cheese. The gentle flavour and texture of Colby gives a new definition to grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, fajitas, chili, rye bread or apples and pears. To accentuate the flavour it is sometimes blended with other cheeses such as Monterey Jack, to make Colby Jack cheese.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and colour. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. A few times, Comté gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened such as Comté Fort Saint-Antoine.Comté was one of the first few kinds of cheese to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tonnes of annual production.Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savoured while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.Fromageries Arnaud, the winner of Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards, is one of the top-notch groups in the world to make French certified-origin cheeses. Today, the Fromagerie counts for roughly 12% of the total Comté production. The cheese is distributed worldwide by British supplier Anthony Rowcliffe & Son. This celebrated cheese has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.In addition, Comte produced by Entremont also won a silver medal for its great taste and impeccable texture.

This hard, crumbly Mexican cheese is made mainly from cow’s milk.When the cheese is made, it is white, fresh and salty thus bearing immense resemblance to feta cheese. However, with ageing, it becomes hard and crumbly like Parmigiano-Reggiano. Its similarity with Parmesan has earned it the nickname ""Parmesan of Mexico"". The aged version of Cotija is referred to as ""anejo"".Traditionally, Cotija cheese was made with raw milk aged for three to twelve months. But the commercial productions add an enzyme to speed up the ripening process. This need for acceleration gives the commercial produce a slight change in flavour compared to the artisanal variety.Since, Cotija cheese is very salty, strongly flavoured, firm and does not actually melt, it is used for grating on salads, soups, casseroles, tacos, tostadas and chilli. In Mexico, it is also widely used to enhance the flavour of many savoury dishes by mixing directly into the casserole or recipe. In the U.S. it is increasingly popular on pasta.

During those days, only the wealthy and commercial establishments had access to refrigerators. In the summers, middle class households had to store their dairy products in iceboxes cooled with ice blocks. Cheeses could not compete with milk and butter for a place in the icebox and had to fend for themselves.Consumers requested for a variant of Monterey Jack that would not become runny in the summers. The solution was Dry Jack, a hard cheese, aged from ten months to upto four years. Firm in texture with a pale yellow pate, the cheese has a rich, nutty yet mild and assertive flavour. As the cheese ages Dry Jack wheels become increasingly brittle. As the cheese is similar in texture to Parmesan, it makes a good substitute for churning and grating over salads, pasta, soups or tacos. The cheese can be shred, cooked, sliced or even eaten as it is. You will never go wrong by grating Dry Jack over casseroles, toasted cheese sandwiches, omelets and soufflés.

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.Extra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

In fact, Feta occupies 70% stake in Greek cheese consumption. The cheese is protected by EU legislation and only those cheeses manufactured in Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Lesvos and Island of Kefalonia can be called ‘feta’. Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called ‘white cheese’.To create traditional feta, 30 percent of goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat and cow’s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, full flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, cultures all have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of feta.On the whole, Feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age which can be extremely creamy, or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavour of Feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

The other versions are much milder than the original Fontina. There is also a Danish version which can be recognized by the red wax rind. Italian Fontina has a natural rind that turns tan to orange-brown with ageing.Fontina Val d'Aosta is traditionally made from the unpasteurised milk of the Valdaostan Red Spotted cows grazing on the plains of Aosta Valley. The texture and flavour of Fontina depend on how long it has been aged. The texture can vary from semi-soft to firm and the flavours from mild and rich to more robust and overpowering. Usually, fontina is aged for 90 days.The interior of fontina is pale cream in colour and riddled with holes known as ""eyes"". With a fat content of 45%, the cheese is very rich and creamy which gets nuttier with ageing. This versatile cheese can be used to make fondues and similar Italian dishes.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. There are only four cheesemakers in Gloucestershire who make Single Gloucester. It is matured for a less amount of time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.Double Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cow’s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep’s or goat’s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda’s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification.

Grana Padano,unknown,,Po River Valley,,,natural,,,no,,"Grana Padano, granted DOP on 12 June 1996, is one of the few cheeses that can possibly compete with the King of Cheeses; Parmigiano-Reggiano. Created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle in the 12th century, it is still made throughout the Po River Valley in northeastern Italy.The cheese is made from unpasteurised, semi-skimmed cow’s milk from two milking and generally aged for two years. At the end of the cheese making process, Grana Padano develops a firm, thick and deeply straw-coloured rind protecting the fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means “grainy” in Italian which is reflected in the fine granular texture with an intensely sweet flavour. As Grana Padano ages, the flavours become pronounced, savory and complex and the texture becomes more crumbly.Though similar to Parmigiano Reggiano Grana Padano is inexpensive because areas producing the cheese are bigger. Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling.Grana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter, and 15 to 18 cm in height. It is sold at different ripening stages: Grana Padano (9 to 16 months), Grana Padano oltre 16 mesi (over 16 months) and Grana Padano Riserva (over 20 months).Try pairing the cheese with a Barolo, Zinfandel or Gavi white wine.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

Around the world, Grana is a generic term used to define three main varieties of grana cheese—Parmigianino-Reggiano, Grana Padano and Grana Trentino and other smaller variants like Granone Lodigiano, Trentingrana and Gransardo. However, in Europe, the word “Grana” is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin, such that only Grana Padano can use the term to sell its produce in EU countries.The most popular Grana Italian cheeses are of course Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. True Parmigianino-Reggiano, named after the Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua, in which it is made, has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste.Grana Padano, on the other hand, refers to the valley Pianura Padana in which it is made. Though similar to Parmigianino-Reggiano, young Grana Padano is slightly less crumbly, milder and less complex than its famous, aged kin. On the other hand, Grana Trentino follows the same method to produce Parmigianino Reggiano but is made in the province of Trento, giving it is name.All three main varieties of Grana cheese carry the label D.O.P.

Since the cheese is not aged, the texture remains soft and it spoils very fast. These days it is very rare to find the cheese commercially because of its neutral taste and short-lived shelf life.

Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987. In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. It pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese has won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.

Among all its synonyms, leipäjuusto is the more commonly known name.Leipäjuusto is a fresh cheese made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved. It can be made also from reindeer or even goat's milk. The cheese is called 'Leipäjuusto' (bread cheese) or 'Juustoleipa' (cheese bread) since it is 'toasted' during its preparation. The oven cheese contains about 20 to 22% milk fat while today's lighter versions contain about 12% milk fat.Traditionally, people used to let leipäjuusto get totally dried so that they could then store it for up to several years. For eating, they used to heat the almost rock hard Leipäjuusto cheese on a fire to soften it and to produce appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese is dried by keeping it in a well ventilated area for a few days.

It is about the hallmark black-brown patina that develops as the cheese matures for 3 months in the cheese dairy and for more than 300 days in the sandstone caves of Kaltbach. During this maturation process, white crystals and drops of water are formed from the cheese, known as ""tears of joy"". These ""tears of joy"" are a sign of quality in the cheese. The cave maturation results in a tangly nutty flavour and crumbly texture, typical of the fine Swiss classic from the caves. This genuine classic tastes delicious with dried apricots, caramelized onions, bacon, cheese plates, panini, casseroles, gratins.

It is also known as strained yoghurt, yoghurt cheese or Greek yoghurt. Traditionally in Arabian countries, the whey is strained in paper bag or filter, made of muslin. While Labneh is classified as a cheese, it retains the distinctive sour flavour of yoghurt. It forms a traditional and important ingredient of Middle Eastern and south Asian cuisine. The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation.

The cheese was invented by Simon Jones from Lincolnshire, who decided to turn the spring milk from his herd of Holsteins into cheese.Traditional Lincolnshire Poacher is available in a cylindrical shape, coated by a rind appearing similar to granite. It is a slow-maturing cheese that takes between 12-24 months to develop a golden, straw-coloured yellow pate and spotted brown and grey colour rind. One gets daily and seasonal variation in terms of both flavour and texture but all-in-all the cheese has both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities. It has a smooth texture and a strong taste. In summer, notes of pineapple, toasted nuts and grassy dominate the flavour profile while in winter the taste becomes savoury and almost meaty. Lincolnshire Poacher pairs well with full-bodied reds and whites and beer.The company makes many other traditional kinds of cheese such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher aged for 18 to 22 months, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel and Lincolnshire Red which is made using vegetarian rennet.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It is a soft, wet cheese made from raw cow milk and can be ripened or unripened depending on its variation. The tradition of making Minas cheese is more than 300 years old. In May 2008, the original firm, ripened Minas cheese was declared a Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage.The time left to ripen Minas cheese can vary from as little as 4 -10 days, which results in queijos-de-minas frescal cheese. It has a spongy texture, with lots of air bubbles inside with a mild yet quite salty taste. The saltiness will vary according to the region and producer. This is not a good cooking cheese but can be used to make sandwiches, pastries and crêpes. The texture tends to become slightly rubbery rather than stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked strong-tasting vegetables and salads.If left to mature for around 1-5 weeks, the soft unripened variety develops into partly-cured Minas cheese (queijo minas meia-cura). The fully-cured variety of Minas cheese called queijo minas curado is ready when juicy softness has evaporated and it acquires a yellowish tint. Curado cheese has a white core, pricked with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a more stronger taste, deviating to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used in a huge variety of dishes, particularly the famous pão de queijo (cheese bun). One of the most popular desserts in Brazil is a sweet dish called goiabada prepared with Minas cheese and guavas. A branded, supermarket variety called Queijo Padrao is also popular across Brazil. It is similar to frescal, except that it is less soft, juicy and salty than the original.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

The cheese takes about 45 days to 3 months for full maturation with yellowish, moist and leathery rind.Together with 45% fat, it is protected by AOC designation. Morbier has a rich and creamy flavour with small eyes or holes. Sometimes, the cheese leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste and has strong aroma as well. Try this cheese with Gewurztraminer or Pinot Noir.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It has been made in Greece for thousands of years and is believed to be the ancestor of all Greek whey cheeses. There are two forms of mizythra, fresh and dried.Fresh mizythra is unsalted and consumed within a few days. In some parts of Greece, especially Crete, fresh mizythra is slightly fermented, until it becomes sour to taste. The result is a creamy, spreadable cheese called ‘xinomizythra’ or ‘sour mizythra’. The snowy white cheese with flavour similar to Ricotta Salata is used by Cretans to spread on paximadia or prepare tyropitas and kaltsounakia cheese pies.Aged mizythra with rock hard texture and salty taste is called dried mizythra. In this form, mizythra is usually savored as a grating or cooking cheese over spaghettis.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

The cheese comes from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy and dates back to the days when the livestock was migrated from place to place.The term ‘Pallone’ comes from the word ‘palla’, the round ball-like shape of the cheese, which makes it easier to hang them in caves or transport over the backs of the donkeys during the livestock migration or the transhumance. The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg. It is shaped like a balloon, and was traditionally created in the city of Gravina, in the province of Bari. However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera.The rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and ‘spun’ in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry. In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union. Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It offers a characteristic flavour derived by rubbing the cheese with olive oil and ash, before it’s left for maturing. The flavour of younger wheels reveals quite a bit of saltiness along with a distinct savoury and aromatic herbal taste. As the cheese matures, the savoury flavour and tanginess become stronger.

Pecorino Romano,pasteurized or unpasteurized cow's or sheep's milk,Italy,"Lazio, Sardinia",hard,"crumbly, dense, flaky and grainy",natural,"salty, sharp, smokey , spicy","nutty, strong",no,,"Pecorino is a term used to define Italian cheeses made from 100% sheep’s milk. However, the American counterpart of the cheese is made from cow’s milk. Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, Pecorino Romano is one of the most ancient types of cheese as well as the most famous outside of Italy. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on how much they have aged.As the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to the Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella have mentioned about the cheese & its production technique, in their works. Even today, the cheese is made using only traditional methods in the unique areas of origin. Dry-salted by hand, the wheels get a salting numerous times, to deliver a fabulous taste. Its lengthy aging time from eight to 12 months results in a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for eight months or longer.Pecorino Romano is one of most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheeses. Because of the hard texture and sharp & salty flavour, Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, breads and baking casseroles. Although, the use of the cheese is limited because of its extreme saltiness. Pair it with a glass of big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

Pecorino,sheep's milk,Italy,,hard,"creamy, crumbly, firm and open",,"buttery, mild, nutty",,no,,"Pecorino is the name given to all Italian cheeses made from sheep's milk. It covers a wide variety of cheeses produced around the country, but specifically it refers to four main varieties of Pecorino, all of which enjoy PDO protection. These hard ewes’ milk cheeses from central Italy and the island of Sardinia have established a very good export market outside Italy.Of these four, Pecorino Romano from Sardinia, Lazio and Tuscan Province of Grosseto is the most widely known outside of Italy. The remaining three mature PDO cheeses are Pecorino Sardo from Sardinia, Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily and Pecorino Toscano from Tuscany.Pecorinos are traditional, creamery, hard, drum-shaped cheeses. They come in a variety of flavours determined by their age. Aged Pecorinos referred to as ‘stagionato’ are hard and crumbly in texture with buttery and nutty flavours. Young or ‘semi-stagionato’ and ‘fresco’ Pecorinos feature a softer texture with mild, creamy flavours. A good Pecorino will have smooth, hard rind that is pale straw to dark brown in colour. The rind will vary in colour, depending on the age of the cheese, and may include a protecting coating of lard or oil. Its compact interior is white to pale yellow in colour, with irregular, small eyes.Today, this classic Italian cheese is available in many flavours including Pecorino Pepato spiced with black peppercorns or red chili.

Because it is not ripened, Queso Blanco is also known as Queso Fresco or fresh cheese.Due to its short maturation process, the cheese is extremely simple to make at home. The procedure for making the cheese is similar to Indian paneer, which includes boiling whole fresh milk, adding an acidifying agent to form the curds and then draining the curds in a cheesecloth.The texture and flavour of Queso Blanco is mild, firm and crumbly. It softens without melting, a characteristic very important in Latin American cooking. One can crumble Queso Blanco on salads, over rice and beans or serve it as a table cheese with fresh fruit, marmalade or chutney.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

A hard cheese from the pasta filata family, Ragusano is made with whole milk from Modicana breed of cows fed on fresh grass or hay. In case where milk from other cow breeds is used, due to scarcity of Modicana breed, the cheese is called “Cosacavaddu rausanu”.The cheese is sold at different stages of aging in rectangular blocks. When it is fresh within two months of production, the cheese tastes sweet, pleasant and delicate. Cheeses ripened beyond six months tend to become more flavourful and spicier with age. The rind is smooth, thin and exhibits a yellowish-golden colour that deepens as the cheese ages. Ragusano, smoked using natural processes is also available and here the designation stamp will have the word “affumicato” attached to the name of the cheese.

The history of the cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk.Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to Cheddar but much more moist, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach it's optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages.

In the 1930s, the farmers had to dilute goat’s milk with cow’s to produce the cheese due to the scarcity of goatherds. But, today they have returned to their roots and produce this rare cheese purely from goat's milk.Rigotte can be eaten fresh but the actual flavours develop on maturity. The pate will become slightly moist and the rind nearly dry and finely wrinkled. A nutty, delicate flavour of honey and acacia will leave a wonderful taste in the mouth.It goes with Condrieu, red wines like Cornas and maybe a white St. Joseph.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

It has a grainy texture, a hard and brittle rind and grates easily. The curing of Romano takes not less than 5 months and longer if it is planned for grating.Every Romano cheese has its own peculiarities and shows different shades in texture, flavour and cooking uses. While Pecorino Romano, made from sheep’s milk, is sharp and quite tangy the second type of Romano cheese, Caprino Romano made from goat’s milk has an extremely sharp taste. The third variety made from cow’s milk, Vacchino Romano, is very mild in flavour.Romano cheese works excellent as a table cheese.

It is moist and creamy with spicy undertones. This cheese has a piquant flavour which makes it a perfect table cheese. It can be used in salads, added to sauces or melted over baked dishes.There are various producers around the world who make Tilsit under their brand’s name. This includes the one made on Heidi farms in Tasmania, Australia, called as 'Heidi Tilsit'.Though the cheese was called as Royalp Tilsit or Tilsiter in Switzerland during olden days, it is now simply referred to as Tilsiter or just Tilsit. Outside of Switzerland it is known by different names depending upon where it is produced. It is called as Havarti Tilsit in Denmark, and Tilsiter or Tollenser in Germany.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

This makes it one of the oldest protected cheeses in the world.The cheese is produced from skimmed cow’s milk with addition of blue fenugreek, a type of clover which gives the cheese a pale lime colour. It is an extremely expensive herb brought to Europe in ancient times from the Middle East. At the last stages of production, Schabziger is molded into distinctive conical shapes and then wrapped in silver foil, ready to be sold.Texturally, the cheese is dry, hard and aged while flavour wise it is pungent, spicy and delicious. If a milder taste is required, the cheese is mixed with butter to make a spread called Zigerbutter. The cheese is used in cooking as a condiment or as a dipping similar to the Dukkah. It is also grated over food or the butter-mix paste is spread over bread or crackers.

Vacherin Fribourgeois,unpasteurized cow's milk,Switzerland,"Bulle, Fribourg & Jura","semi-soft, artisan",firm and open,washed,"acidic, buttery, nutty","grassy, pleasant, strong",no,,"Vacherin Fribourgeois AOC is a Swiss semi-soft cheese made with raw cow’s milk in the towns of Bulle (Canton Vaud) and Fribourg (Canton Fribourg in west-central Switzerland). This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.The milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.This traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12–25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9–25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).Vacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy’s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well.Over 500,000 page views per month, Put your store on our map!Want to be listed on cheese.com?

A variety of dairy products are produced here because of its clean, lush pastures and diverse climate. With the access of technology from England in 1850s, it started making more than 160 varieties of cheeses.Washed rind cheeses are originally from the alleys of northern France, made famous by the monks who invented them. It was a deliberate attempt to develop the meaty flavour in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for long periods of time. Washed rind cheeses are periodically washed in a solution of saltwater brine, wines and/or mould-bearing agents so that their surface becomes responsive to bacteria. This bacterium (Brevibacterium Linens) “smears” the cheese with a firm, palatable, bright red/orange rind and imparts pungent odours and distinctive flavours to the product. Also known as surface ripened, the cheeses can be soft, semi-hard, or hard. Some common examples are Titlist, Gruyere and Raclette who have their rinds washed during the maturation process to develop a crusty shell.This rich cheese has a robust aroma with a sweet, earthy flavour that is a little nutty.
